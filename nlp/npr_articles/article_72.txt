S. service members and at least one Iraqi service member suffered injuries in an attack by Iranian-backed militants on an air base in western Iraq, U. S. officials said. A barrage of missiles and rockets targeted the Ain al-Asad base on Saturday evening, U. S. Central Command said in a statement. Most of the missiles were intercepted by the base's air defense systems, according to the military, but an untold number hit the base where Americans and Iraqis are stationed. A damage assessment is ongoing. A "number" of U. S. personnel are being evaluated for traumatic brain injuries, CENTCOM said, without specifying how many. Last month, three U. S. service members were wounded, one critically, in a drone attack on their base in northern Iraq. The U. S. responded with airstrikes that it said destroyed facilities and likely killed a number of Kataib Hezbollah militants in Iraq. It's the latest in a series of back-and-forth attacks between Iran-aligned groups and U. S. forces in the region since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel that led to the deadly war in Gaza. Since then, the U. S. has issued warnings of a wider war in the region. Hamas is part of a regional alliance supported by Iran and loosely united by their resistance to Western powers and Israel.
