Editor's note: Some images may contain graphic content. In Gaza, some cellular phone service has been restored after more than 24 hours of a communications blackout. As Palestinians start to recover their ability to reach the outside world, news of the deteriorating conditions in Gaza is starting to trickle out. Israel pounded Gaza with more air and ground attacks overnight in an escalating military campaign as the United Nations warned civil order was "starting to break down" in the besieged Palestinian territory. Thousands of civilians, both Palestinians and Israelis, have died after Palestinian Hamas militants based in the Gaza Strip entered southern Israel in an attack on Oct. 7, triggering Israel to declare war on Hamas and launch bombings on Gaza.
