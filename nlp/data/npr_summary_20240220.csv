1,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/20/1232399222/israel-ramadan-al-aqsa-mosque,"TEL AVIV, Israel – The Muslim holy month of Ramadan is always a period of heightened tensions around Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque, as hundreds of thousands of worshipers line up to enter one of Islam's holiest sites to pray. But a proposal for new restrictions on worshipers entering the site — also sacred to Jews as the foundation of their ancient temple — by Israel's  far-right national security minister has raised tensions at a time when Israel is waging a war in Gaza that has cost tens of thousands of lives, following an attack by Hamas that was the deadliest since Israel's founding. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not yet dismissed the controversial plan proposed by Itamar Ben-Gvir to limit access to the mosque even more than in previous years. Ben-Gvir, who lives in a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Israeli security forces should prevent Palestinian residents from the occupied West Bank from entering the Al-Aqsa Mosque, built on huge stone platform in Jerusalem's Old City and known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as the Temple Mount.  The plan would also prohibit Palestinians with Israeli citizenship below the age of 70 from visiting the site during Ramadan, which begins next month. Ben-Gvir, an ultra-nationalist member of Netanyahu's cabinet, said the restrictions were necessary because ""we should not allow residents from the [Palestinian] Authority to enter Israel in any way. "" Israel ""cannot take chances and risks. "" Netanyahu's office told NPR the prime minister is ""considering Ben-Gvir's opinion on placing restrictions during Ramadan,"" but added that ""there are still no concrete plans. "" An earlier statement released by his office said he had ""made a balanced decision that allows for religious freedom within the limits of the security needs as established by heads of the security establishment. "" The prime minister's office added a note of caution, saying that ""any reports to the contrary are false. "" That reflected fears in Jerusalem that harsher restrictions could lead to a spike in unrest at a highly sensitive time.  Israel is already under mounting international pressure not to push its Gaza offensive into the crowded southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians who have fled fighting in the Gaza Strip have sought shelter. The Gaza health ministry said this week that more than 29,000 people have been killed since the start of the war, triggered by an attack on Israel by Hamas on Oct. 7 that killed 1,200 people. Another 240 were taken hostage. Hamas is still holding 134 hostages and on Sunday, Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz issued an ultimatum to Hamas: release all the Israelis still captive in Gaza before Ramadan or ""the fighting will continue everywhere, to include the Rafah area. ""A full-scale land invasion of Rafah would be a humanitarian disaster ""beyond imagination,"" said Dr. Teresa Zakaria, the World Health Organization's incident manager for the conflict in the occupied Palestinian territories. For its part, the United States insists that Israel needs  a credible plan to evacuate the more than a million Palestinians in Rafah before it launches an operation.  And in the West Bank, tensions have also been rising since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, with an escalation in attacks by armed Jewish settlers against Palestinians in recent months. In Israel, there remains deep anger over Netanyahu's response to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas and his failure to bring home all of the hostages. For worshipers like Rauf Abu Nab, the Ben-Gvir plan would cut off access to the third holiest site in the world for Muslims after Mecca and Medina. As a Jerusalem resident, he would ordinarily be able to attend prayers at the mosque. ""He will not be able to implement this. He is destroying the whole image of Israel,"" said Abu Nab, 65, as he drove out of Silwan, an East Jerusalem neighborhood that sits in the shadow of the Al-Aqsa compound. ""No one stands in the path of God,"" he said, before driving off. Israel has imposed restrictions on access to the compound in the past, including  preventing tourists and Jewish Israelis from entering during Ramadan in the years before 2000. In 2022, restrictions were imposed on most men over 40 from the West Bank, although Israeli security forces allowed women and young children from the occupied West Bank to enter Jerusalem without a permit. Ben-Gvir's latest proposals have caused consternation in Jerusalem. Mustafa Abu Sway, a member of the Al-Aqsa Mosque advisory council, said it's disappointing to see the compound being used as political tool. ""It's a rallying point for right and the right of the right of the right [wing] in terms of extremism. It's nationalism in a very twisted sense. It's a mosque, a Noble Sanctuary,"" said Abu Sway. ""Al Aqsa should have been spared the internal Israeli politics,"" he added. Abu Sway points out that the Second Intifada — or uprising — erupted in the aftermath of the September 2000 visit to the Al-Aqsa compound by Ariel Sharon, who at the time was running for prime minister. Riots began the following day, starting a period of unrest that lasted five years. It was a campaign tactic and it worked, said Abu Sway, as Sharon was elected the following year. Officials from Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence service, declined a request for comment on the national security minister's proposals. Hamas issued a statement condemning the potential restrictions and called on Palestinians to ""reject this criminal decision and go to Al-Aqsa Mosque. ""It also issued a warning: should the freedom to worship there be prohibited, ""it will not pass without accountability. "" Ben-Gvir's proposal has also brought backlash from opposition members within the Israeli government. Knesset member Ahmad Tibi, chairman of the Hadash-Ta'al party, said Ben-Gvir and Netanyahu were trying to stir unrest among Palestinians. Labor Party Knesset member Gilad Kariv accused the prime minister of ""putting the security of the citizens of Israel in danger"" by courting far-right elements of his coalition. Given the acutely tense state of affairs in the region, and with Israel warning of a new offensive in south Gaza during Ramadan, there are fears over any fallout from the new restrictions at the mosque. ""Prohibiting Muslims from praying at Al-Aqsa Mosque is really what could instigate problems ahead,"" said Abu Sway. Abeer Zayyad, a historian, archeologist and expert on the Al-Aqsa Mosque, said the restrictions are part of a pattern. She noted that before 2000, tourists and Jewish Israelis weren't allowed into Al Aqsa during Ramadan. Then, they were allowed in for the first 10 days. Then the first 20 days. And such attendance increases the Israeli security presence and raises fears among Muslims that the status of the site is changing. ""But its not about the numbers. It's about the fact that they don't want us,"" she said. She said that if the Ben-Gvir plan is enacted, it would create ""a dangerous situation. "" ""I think the whole world is worried about that . . . I think even Israelis themselves are worried about that,"" said Zayyad. Gershon Baskin, an Israeli social and political activist and former hostage negotiator, told NPR that any move to further limit Palestinian access to the Al-Aqsa compound would likely backfire.  He described Al-Aqsa as ""a raw, nuclear nerve. """"Anytime someone touches it, it blows up in our face,"" said Baskin. The Al-Aqsa Mosque – and all that the compound encompasses, including the Dome of the Rock, believed by Muslims to mark the place where the Prophet Mohammad ascended to heaven, is a ""symbol of unity,"" for Palestinians. ""It's the one place that all Palestinians feel like they have control,"" said Baskin. And control is something Palestinians say they now lack in virtually all elements of their lives – as Israeli security restrictions have increased in the aftermath of Oct. 7. Zayyad said she feared every step in this conflict - even ones taken outside Gaza - will ""take us to a different level and a different situation. "" ""None of us knows where this will end. It's going to be a very tough year in Jerusalem. """,npr_articles/article_1.txt,npr_results/article_1.txt.json
2,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/20/1232636543/un-security-council-gaza-cease-fire-vote,"The United States has vetoed another United Nations Security Council resolution on the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, rejecting calls for an immediate cease-fire. The U. S. has proposed its own draft, which it says would support delicate diplomacy toward releasing hostages taken in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in Israel. The draft resolution that Algeria proposed would have demanded an immediate humanitarian cease-fire. The vote in the 15-member Security Council was 13 in favor and the United States against. The United Kingdom abstained. The resolution came after more than four months of war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza and whose attack in Israel killed 1,200 people, according to Israel's government. Israel's military offensive since then has killed more than 29,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Backed by many other countries, Arab nations have been demanding a cease-fire for months. U. S. Ambassador to the U. N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield argues that a cease-fire without requiring Hamas to release hostages would fail to bring about durable peace. ""Proceeding with a vote today was wishful and irresponsible,"" she said. ""While we cannot support a resolution that would put sensitive negotiations in jeopardy, we look forward to engaging on a text that we believe will address so many of the concerns we all share. ""Thomas-Greenfield says diplomats are working on a deal that would bring about a six-week pause in fighting and hopes to get its proposal approved in the Security Council. ""We're eager to continue working with the [Security] Council on this proposal, one that would see a temporary cease-fire as soon as practicable, based on the formula of all hostages being released,"" she said after the vote. The proposal ""would get aid into the hands of those Palestinians who so desperately need it,"" she added. She said the Biden administration has pressed Israel not to follow through with  plans for a ground invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where 1. 5 million civilians are taking refuge. Israeli forces ""have not gone in to attack Rafah and we will keep engaging and urging and pushing in that direction to ensure that that does not happen,"" she said. The U. S. has vetoed or abstained from voting on previous resolutions on Gaza, while Russia and China have vetoed a U. S. proposal.",npr_articles/article_2.txt,npr_results/article_2.txt.json

5,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/19/1231129046/israeli-settlers-palestinians-violence-hebron-west-bank,"HEBRON, West Bank — It's a chilly winter day in Hebron, and Issa Amro is late. ""He said he was at the checkpoint, so maybe he was held up,"" says Joel Carmel, an ex-Israeli soldier and peace activist, as he stands with a small group of journalists at the gate to Amro's house. Amro is a prominent Palestinian in Hebron. For years, he has been trying to preach nonviolence in one of the West Bank's most dangerous cities — a place where, over the years, Palestinian militants and far-right Israeli settlers have frequently attacked each other. He has also led peaceful protests against the Israeli military's restrictions against Palestinians in the city. He is well known by people on both sides of the conflict, which makes him a frequent target of harassment by Israeli forces. Amro eventually appears, moving slowly up a narrow path between olive trees. He's wearing a green one-piece snowsuit and sporting a thick beard. He apologizes to the waiting group. ""I was at a checkpoint for 30 minutes,"" he explains. Today the soldier made him take everything off. ""He told me, 'Take the shoes off. ' I told him, 'But it's mud[dy]. ' He said, 'That's not my business,'"" Amro recalls. For decades, far-right Jewish settlers have laid claim to parts of Hebron's center, near the Tomb of the Patriarchs, a site holy to both Jews and Muslims. Over the years, settlers have committed many acts of violence against Palestinian residents, and Palestinian militants have sometimes opened fire on settlers. And although the military's mission is to protect the settlers, it used to be seen as a moderating force. Amro says that Palestinians sometimes even asked for help: ""In the past, we could call upon the army to protect us from the settlers,"" he says. But as his harassment at the checkpoint shows, that relationship has changed. In 2022, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed a far-right politician from Hebron named Itamar Ben-Gvir as the national security minister. Military forces became more aggressive toward Palestinians, Amro says. And then came the attacks of Oct. 7. Hamas militants burst out of the Gaza Strip and massacred some 1,200 people in Israel, according to Israeli authorities. The Israeli military mobilized, sending tens of thousands of troops into Gaza to destroy Hamas. Thousands more were sent along the nation's northern border with Lebanon and Syria to guard against attacks by Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia group. To maintain the military presence in the West Bank, the military mobilized thousands of reservists as part of newly formed ""regional defense"" battalions. It also strengthened what the government called ""emergency response units"" made up of heavily armed civilians. In many cases, according to activists and Palestinians, those ranks have been filled by the very far-right Jewish settlers who have been at the center of much of the violence. Israeli peace activists and Palestinian locals both say that the result has been a huge uptick in violence and harassment by ""settlers in a green army uniform,"" as Amro describes it. Often it's unclear whether the settlers are reservists, members of emergency units or freelancers operating on their own. ""What we're seeing is something that looks like joint militias of settlers and soldiers,"" says Dror Sadot, spokesperson for the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, which closely tracks settler violence in the West Bank. ""No one knows who's who and who's giving the orders. ""The blurring of roles began in the hours after the Oct. 7 attack. The West Bank is not under the control of Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, and there was no mass attack in Hebron on that day. But when Amro tried to get home from work, he found his way blocked — not by soldiers, he says, but by heavily armed settlers with body armor. Amro shared videos from that day with NPR, which was able to independently verify some details, such as the locations and rough times when they were shot. In one recording, two older men with long beards and assault rifles shout at him to leave. One wearing a white baseball cap pushes another Palestinian man and raises his gun. Amro says he knew them not as soldiers but as right-wing settlers. They seem to know him, shouting his name as he walks away. A little later, he tried another way to his house and again ran into a mixed group of armed settlers and regular soldiers. This time, he was detained. ""I was kidnapped by the soldiers and the settlers,"" he recalls. ""I was taken to the military base here, handcuffed with plastic cuffs to the point that it went into my skin. It was 10 hours of pain. ""He says he was beaten and abused during his time in custody until a senior army officer who recognized him told the others to let him go. The Israeli military did not comment directly on Amro's account but told NPR it ""has acted and continues to act to identify unusual cases that deviate from what is expected of [Israeli military] soldiers. ""Since then, Amro says, things have only gotten worse. Amro says Palestinians in central Hebron have been forced to stay inside for days at a time, by settlers equipped with weapons, radios and uniforms. Those reports have been corroborated by B'Tselem, which documented the curfew. ""There is no distinction anymore between the soldiers and the violent settlers, either in their army uniform or in their civilian uniform,"" Amro says. Below Amro's house, in the streets of central Hebron, the mixing of settlers and soldiers is on display. Nadav Weiman is deputy director of Breaking the Silence, the group that organized the day's visit and that is made up of ex-Israeli soldiers who oppose the occupation of the West Bank. Weiman points to a group of young men in uniform wearing yarmulkes and payot, the long, curly locks of hair worn by some Orthodox Jewish men and boys. ""You see on their patch — it says, 'Ha Gamar Unit of Hebron,'"" he says. That's a recently mobilized reserve unit here that Weiman says is drawing from the local settler population. The young men look well equipped, with rifles, new helmets and body armor. But they're not the only ones here. An older settler walks down the road in green fatigues, equipped with an assault rifle, sidearm and small walkie-talkie. Unlike the reservists, he doesn't have body armor, a helmet or any identifying insignia on his uniform. He scowls at the group as he passes, and Weiman recognizes him instantly: ""He's a settler here from Hebron that I know for a lot of years. ""It's unclear in what capacity the man is operating. And farther into the Old City, someone in a personal vehicle begins honking and shouting at the group. He swings his car aggressively in front of the journalists, blocking their path. This man, too, is a settler, Weiman explains. He's not with the military but with the local emergency response unit. ""He's a settler from the first response team, he has an M16 with him, and he's a violent settler,"" he says. The settlers say this new arrangement is necessary in the post-Oct. 7 world. One named Shai Coen, 23, comes to speak to the journalists. It's true, he says, that many have joined the reserve forces in the West Bank. ""I don't do army, but I have two brothers and my father are reserve now in the army,"" he says. ""Everybody is now in the army. ""Coen says that there's good reason to put settlers into these military roles: The risks of Palestinian violence are higher than ever, and the settlers need to be defended. ""Jewish people are living also here in this country,"" he says. ""We have terror attack. A lot of terror attack. ""In its statement to NPR, the Israeli military said that it had seen a ""significant increase in terrorist attacks"" in the West Bank, with over 700 attempted attacks since the start of the war. It said it conducts operations to apprehend suspects and sets up ""dynamic checkpoints"" as part of its security operations. But it also appears that newly empowered settler groups are attacking and detaining innocent Palestinians. B'Tselem has documented several other detentions that have occurred after Oct. 7 in areas near Hebron, and its researchers have also seen evidence of stepped-up aggression. Basel Adra is a Palestinian who works with B'Tselem and lives in Masafer Yatta, a group of Palestinian villages south of Hebron. Immediately after Oct. 7, he says, heavily armed settlers began showing up in his community. ""They were going around with uniforms in white cars, not military jeeps,"" he says. They've destroyed Palestinian property and harassed locals, often wearing green fatigues and masks to hide their identities. ""They threaten people — if they don't leave the land, they're going to be killed,"" he says. B'Tselem says that it has documented 16 communities in the West Bank where Palestinians have fled their homes following Oct. 7. The Israeli military did not comment directly on the role of settlers in its security operations but said that in cases where its troops are seen misbehaving: ""Those cases will be arbitrated, and significant command measures will be taken against the soldiers involved. ""Back at his home in the hills above central Hebron, Palestinian activist Amro says his settler neighbors have long wanted him and other Palestinians out of their homes. Since Oct. 7, they've relentlessly harassed civilians. ""It's a policy to make our lives harder and harder, to make us leave certain areas,"" he says. Amro estimates 20% to 30% of Palestinian families living nearby have already left. Amro is staying put for now, but he's more frightened than ever. Nobody has given him a vest or helmet to protect himself. Instead, he has bricked up his windows with cinder blocks. ""I think they may come and shoot me in my room, in my bedroom,"" he says.

S. military says it struck an underwater vessel in the Red Sea on Saturday that was deployed by Houthi rebels in Yemen. It was the first time U. S. forces observed the Iranian-backed rebel group using what the military called an ""unmanned underwater vessel"" — or UUV — since beginning a spate of attacks in the region on Oct. 23, officials added. Houthi rebels have been going after international commercial vessels passing through the Red Sea in recent months. The group's leaders claim they're targeting ships with links to Israel in response to the country's ongoing invasion of Gaza. Many of the targeted ships have no connection to Israel. A powerful rebel group backed by Iran, the Houthis voice support for Hamas and have been in control of large parts of Yemen — including the capital Sanaa — since overthrowing the country's government in 2014. Rebels have fired missiles at and deployed drones against commercial vessels traveling through the area, and the U. S. military has repeatedly stepped in to help repel the attacks. Houthi attacks have also targeted U. S. warships. Last month, the U. S. , along with the United Kingdom and other allies, began a series of retaliatory strikes against dozens of Houthi targets in Yemen. U. S. officials said at the time that more than 2,000 ships have had to divert course to avoid transiting the Red Sea, potentially contributing to global shipping delays. U. S. Central Command said that on Saturday between 3:00 p. m. and 8:00 p. m. Sanaa time it successfully conducted five ""self-defense strikes"" against the UUV, an unmanned surface vessel and three mobile anti-ship cruise missiles. The military said it identified the attacks in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and determined that they ""presented an imminent threat to U. S. Navy ships and merchant vessels in the region.

7,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/17/1232259535/khaled-al-serr-gaza-surgeon-nasser-hospital-detained-israel,"RAMALLAH, West Bank — It's been two days since the family and colleagues of Dr. Khaled al-Serr have heard from him. On Thursday, Israel's military surrounded Nasser Hospital, where Serr worked. The Israeli military fired shots, killing one patient and wounding six others, before entering the hospital. For three weeks, Nasser Hospital has not had the resources to send patients to other hospitals for specialized care. So Serr, a general surgeon, had to use WhatsApp to ask specialist colleagues for surgical guidance. On Thursday, Khaled's messages to them grew dire: He wrote that no one could enter the ICU and that the backup ventilators could go out soon, leaving the lives of six patients on respirators in danger. He sent a video showing an ICU patient he said had died because the electricity had been cut off. ""And another six patients is awaiting the same fate,"" he said. That was his last communication to his colleagues. By Saturday evening, frantic colleagues from the groups Healthcare Workers Watch - Palestine, Gaza Medic Voices and Health Workers 4 Palestine issued a statement. ""We are deeply concerned that the Israeli military has abducted and unlawfully detained Khaled Al Serr. We demand his immediate release,"" it read, sharing Serr's messages, photos and a video. It also described Serr's dedication to his patients. ""For almost a month, we have been consulting on cases with Khaled as he performed complex surgeries far outside of his specialty—with virtually no medical supplies and with bullets ricoquetching off the operating theater. He has risked life and limb to save his patients. ""Gaza's health ministry said on Saturday that Israeli forces had detained a large number of medical staff at Nasser Hospital. The Israeli military has previously detained medical personnel. NPR contacted the Israeli military for information on any medical personnel detained at the hospital, and specifically asked if Serr had been detained, but has not received a response. The World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday issued as statement saying it was ""deeply alarmed"" by the descriptions of chaos at Nasser Hospital. ""The hospital is the backbone of the health system in southern Gaza and must remain functional. Health facilities in the south have no capacity to receive more patients,"" WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told a United Nations press conference on Friday. Hospitals are protected under international laws of war, but lose those protections if they are used as operational bases by the military or militants. Nasser Hospital is located in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. The other main hospital there, Al-Amal, had also been raided by the Israeli military, who said they were looking for Hamas militants, leaving Nasser Hospital as the only port of call for many patients. Additionally, thousands of displaced Palestinians had taken shelter there as well as in other hospitals — that have since been evacuated — as the war between Israeli troops and Hamas raged on. Israeli troops said they raided Nasser Hospital acting on intelligence that the bodies of some of the people Hamas kidnapped on Oct. 7 might be there. Israeli forces have killed nearly 29,000 Palestinians since the start of the current conflict, according to the Gaza health ministry. Hamas killed some 1,200 people in Israel in its Oct. 7 attack, triggering the start of the war, and took hostages back to Gaza. The Israeli military issued statements on Friday denying that it had damaged generators or turned off electricity. It also said that troops repaired a damaged generator, and helped a U. N. convoy deliver aid to the hospital — but the Gaza health ministry maintained the hospital still did not have power on Saturday morning. The Israeli military also said it had found Hamas fighters and weapons at the hospital, although no hostage remains have yet been found yet.",npr_articles/article_7.txt,npr_results/article_7.txt.json
8,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/17/1229525320/india-israel-hamas-war-jobs-migrant-workers,"LUCKNOW, India — A devotional song blares from a Hindu temple as dozens of men cram in line for the chance to register for work in Israel. But mostly what the men hear are orders. An official directs them to a warehouse-style waiting room if they haven't already signed up. As the men jostle to get to the head of the line, a security guard orders them to sit down on the ground. ""Do it like gentlemen,"" the guard orders. ""No need for mischief!""This unruly line outside a vocational training center in the northern Indian city of Lucknow is more than 2,700 miles away from Gaza — and it spotlights the many ways the war between Israel and Hamas is affecting life around the world. Israel suspended the work permits of most Palestinian laborers after Hamas-backed militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing more than 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. That triggered the latest war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, where more than 27,000 Palestinians have been killed since Oct. 7, according to Gaza health officials. Palestinian laborers formed the backbone of Israel's construction sector. After the work permit suspensions, most building sites lie idle. ""We don't bring in Arabs from Judea and Samaria because it is a security risk,"" said Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, using a biblical term to describe the Israeli-occupied West Bank. This is what prompted Israel to look for ""alternatives,"" he said during a Feb. 4 news conference. India appears to be one of those alternatives. Haim Feiglin, the deputy president of the Israel Builders Association, told Voice of America soon after the war began that the association was hoping to bring in anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 workers from India. ""Right now we are negotiating with India. We are waiting for [the] decision of the Israeli government to approve that,"" he said in an interview on Nov. 1. Barely two months later, the northern Indian states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh each advertised 10,000 jobs for skilled laborers in Israel. According to an advertisement issued by the Haryana state government, the Israeli recruiters seek carpenters, blacksmiths, tilers and plasterers. Those selected after on-spot interviews and skill tests will receive a monthly wage of more than $1,600, more than five or six times what they would receive for the same work in India. Among the men hopeful for jobs in Israel is Ram Kumar, a 36-year-old carpenter who traveled more than 150 miles to register in Lucknow. On a recent damp, cold morning, he tells NPR it's his third day waiting in line. ""I have two kids, a wife and a father to look after,"" he says. He is still at the back, with hundreds in front of him. The sheer number of job seekers over the previous two days means by the time he gets close to the registration desk, officials will call it a day, he says. Kumar has spent nights at a cousin's home nearby. He says others are sleeping on nearby pavements, on the platform of the nearby railway station and even in an abandoned lot between buildings. Nearby, Bahadur Singh is also applying to work in Israel, even though he's nervous. ""We've heard there are lots of bombs and missiles being thrown around,"" he says. ""Then don't apply if you're so worried!"" snaps an eavesdropping fellow candidate. But the promise of better compensation is too strong a draw. ""I want to give my children a better life than me,"" Singh says. India's foreign ministry has not said whether the men will be sent to areas close to conflict zones, but a spokesperson noted that Israel generally has robust worker protections. Singh says he was motivated to apply because this recruitment drive comes out of a deal between the Indian and Israeli governments, and a government-to-government deal meant he wasn't risking being fleeced by employment agents — that happened to him a few years ago. ""Fraud, sir, fraud,"" he says, shaking his head. He says he paid an agent his life savings, $600, on the promise of a job abroad. Then the agent disappeared. It's a common story for Indians seeking work abroad. Israel and India inked the deal to send Indian workers last May. It was seen as a way of regulating labor between the two countries, which has been growing over the years. Indian skilled laborers and care workers in particular seek employment in Israel because of its relatively high wages. But Israel remains a small market for expatriate Indian labor compared with the Gulf region, for instance, where an estimated 9 million Indians work. The rush for wide-scale recruitment to Israel began in earnest after the conflict erupted between Israel and Hamas. Indian trade unions see the current recruitment as an effort to replace Palestinians who have lost their livelihoods following the outbreak of war. ""Nothing could be more immoral and disastrous,"" said a statement in November by 10 unions, mostly representing construction workers. ""Such a step will amount to complicity on India's part with Israel's ongoing genocidal war against Palestinians. ""Members of the Congress party, the chief opposition to the Hindu nationalist ruling party, also criticized the decision to allow Indian workers to be sent to Israel. ""What are we essentially saying by doing this?"" asked Praveen Chakravarty, a political economist affiliated with the Congress party. ""We are essentially saying, don't worry. Even if you attack Palestinians and you do not have Palestinian labor, we will supplement that. That is direct intervention.

""It shows the two governments are comfortable working with each other, and this is something which has built up over the last 30 years,"" he says.

9,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/16/1231942329/israel-hamas-war-gaza-nasser-hospital-khan-younis,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Since Wednesday, dramatic footage of an Israeli military operation at a hospital in the southern Gaza Strip has shown scenes of chaos, with people running through dark hallways and doctors trying to escort limping patients to safety. Among those remaining was Dr. Khaled al-Serr, a general surgeon who has frantically been trying to find ways to protect patients at Nasser Hospital. He had been in contact with a group of specialist surgeons from all over the world who have been providing expertise and assistance via the phone messaging program WhatsApp to doctors in Gaza. For the past 3 1/2 weeks, doctors at Nasser have been unable to refer patients in need of specialized care elsewhere. So they've been taking instructions from colleagues like Dr. Rebecca Inglis, an intensive care specialist in Oxford, as well as pediatric surgeons, neurosurgeons and more. But on Thursday night, Serr's phone went dark. Inglis' messages to him remain unreceived, and she describes his last messages to her as ""absolutely desperate. """"No one can reach the ICU,"" read one. ""This ICU patient has just died because they cut all the electricity and another six patients is awaiting the same fate,"" said another. He wrote that the Israeli army was inside the hospital, in the city of Khan Younis, and he and his colleagues were trying to communicate with them to allow for ""sending nurses to help on manual ventilation"" — manually squeezing air through a bag and a mask. ""At Nasser Hospital we have no electricity, no drinking water, even no tap water. ""Serr begged for help from United Nations agencies: ""Please we need urgent action now. Communicate with OCHA, U. N. , WHO, any one can help. ""He also wrote that he was having a tough time getting a signal to go online. And that, Inglis hopes, is why she hasn't heard from him. NPR asked the Israeli military for comment on the situation Serr described in the hospital's intensive care unit. No response had been received by the time of publication. The military did issue a statement on Friday evening, saying that it was unaware that the hospital generators weren't working until being told about it on Friday morning. The statement said that  troops then ""worked to repair the generator, while simultaneously Shayetet 13 special forces brought in an alternative generator to the hospital. ""But Gaza's Health Ministry also issued a statement saying the hospital still had no electricity. And Inglis still hasn't heard from Serr. She's worried about the surgeon's safety, and hopes he hasn't been detained as other Palestinian doctors have. The Israeli military said it was operating on intelligence that said the dead bodies of hostages taken by the Palestinian group Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack on Israel were being kept there. During a raid of the hospital Thursday, Israeli forces opened fire, killing a patient and wounding six more before they stormed the complex, according to The Associated Press. The hospital had been under siege for almost a week, and its supplies of food and water were running out as more than a thousand displaced civilians took shelter there, along with hundreds of patients and staff. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, there's no power, no heat, and the remaining fuel supply has already run out. A statement from the ministry said that this leaves the lives of six patients on respirators, and two babies in incubators, in danger. The Israeli military said it was providing a ""safe corridor"" for displaced Palestinians sheltering at the hospital to leave, and issued a statement saying it has ""no intention of disrupting the hospital's function. ""But Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, refuted that claim. ""Access to the hospital remains obstructed — there is no safe corridor for those in need. Two WHO missions have been denied in the last four days and we lost touch with the hospital's personnel,"" he tweeted on Wednesday. ""Nasser is the backbone of the health system in southern Gaza. It must be protected. Humanitarian access must be allowed,"" he added. On Friday, the Israeli military released photos of men it said were Hamas militants found in the hospital, and said it found weapons there. Soldiers digging through rubble at the hospital had not yet uncovered any hostage remains. Last week, Israeli forces stormed another medical facility in Khan Younis, Al-Amal Hospital. While patients were moved out of the hospital, with fewer medical facilities operating and virtually no humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip, there are few options for patients in need of treatment or surgery. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October, Israel's military has maintained that Hamas fighters are using hospitals as cover. Israeli troops raided Gaza City's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, in November, saying that Hamas has used the facility — and tunnels beneath it — as a command center. This claim was also repeated by U. S. officials. The Israeli military said it found tunnels and a cache of weapons, but no Hamas fighters. It remains unclear if Hamas ever used the hospital or its compound as a command center to launch its Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. Hamas killed about 1,200 people that day, and kidnapped around 240, according to Israel's government. Since then, Gaza's Health Ministry says Israel's bombardment of the territory has killed at least 28,663 Palestinians. Israel has been looking for hostages as well as Hamas fighters throughout the Gaza Strip. On Jan. 30, Israeli soldiers disguised as women or wearing medical scrubs also carried out an operation at the Ibn Sina Hospital in the West Bank town of Jenin, killing three people they said were Hamas militants. While hospitals are protected under laws of war, international law experts say, hospitals can lose certain protections if they are used for military purposes. The U. N. Human Rights Office has expressed alarm over Israeli military operations at hospitals, saying that Israeli troops should use precautions when targeting medical facilities. ""Even if Israel contends that a medical facility has lost its protection as a result of being used for acts harmful to the Israeli forces, it must nevertheless comply with the principles of precautions and proportionality,"" it said in a statement Thursday. Inglis started going into Gaza regularly in 2016 as part of a group of surgeons and medics from the United Kingdom who travel there to train new doctors, and said she is familiar with the crumbling state of the health care system there. But this feels very different to her. ""What's been new about this conflict is the systematic way in which the health care system of Gaza appears to have been targeted,"" Inglis said. ""It's unbelievable that this is being done under the watchful gaze of the international community. """,npr_articles/article_9.txt,npr_results/article_9.txt.json

A series of deadly strikes on Wednesday and Thursday served as a warning that the daily cross-border skirmishes between Israel and forces in Lebanon could quickly escalate. Tensions began to ratchet up on Wednesday morning, when a barrage of rockets fired from Lebanon struck three towns in northern Israel, less than 10 miles from the border between the two countries. One Israeli soldier was killed and at least eight others were wounded, according army and medical officials. Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese militia, has not claimed responsibility for the attacks, but says it has been firing rockets at Israeli positions near the border as part of its deterrence strategy toward Israel and in solidarity with Hamas. By Wednesday afternoon, the Israeli military confirmed that it had struck targets in at least five towns in southern Lebanon, killing at least 13 people. According to Lebanese state media, the dead included three Hezbollah fighters and 10 civilians. A Syrian woman and her two sons, ages 2 and 13, were among the civilians killed. Israel launched further strikes on Thursday. Analysts say that Israel and Hezbollah would both like to avoid all-out battle, but the past two days of attacks have led to an escalating war of words between officials on both sides. In a statement to Reuters, Hassan Fadlallah, a Lebanese lawmaker and senior Hezbollah official, said that Israel ""will pay for the price of these crimes. "" In a meeting with military reserve commanders on Wednesday, Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), emphasized his country's plan to prepare for a war on its northern front. ""This is our first task and no one disagrees with us, and we are now focusing on being prepared for war in the north,"" said Halevi, in comments shared with the press. ""In the end, we will be ready for a war. It if doesn't end in war, won't end in a compromise,"" he added, referring to pushing back against Hezbollah. There's a lot of history at this border, where there has been off and on conflict in some measure since 1982, when Israel invaded Lebanon in an effort to dismantle the Palestinian Liberation Organization inside the country. By 1985, Hezbollah started fighting Israel for border territory in a conflict that lasted 15 years. In 2006, another war erupted with the killing and abduction of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah. There remains disputed territory at the border — roughly 330 square miles of land that hold natural gas resources. Israel wants Hezbollah to pull its forces away from the border, as agreed upon after the 2006 war. Despite the rhetoric, Imad Salamey, a senior Middle East policy advisor and associate professor of political science and international affairs at Lebanese American University in Beirut, told NPR that Hezbollah is not seeking to expand the conflict. Salamey described the current fighting as part of ""Hezbollah's game of tit-for-tat with Israeli troops on the border,"" and as with other Iranian proxies, it is ""involved in various approaches to distract Israeli troops"" from the conflict in Gaza. But Hezbollah ""is not trying to invite a massive retaliation,"" Salamey said.  A war in Lebanon would also not serve Israel's best interest, according to Salamey, because it risks undermining efforts to secure northern Israeli towns, which means people are unlikely to want to move back. In his statement on Wednesday, the IDF's Halevi emphasized the importance of returning displaced Israelis back to their homes in the north, referring to those who evacuated towns near the border with Lebanon after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people. Still, Salamey said there's reason to be concerned. ""A spillover or things getting out of hand may lead to a much wider scale type of war and that's very concerning,"" he said. Sarah-Masha Fainberg, a senior defense expert at Tel Aviv University, said the possibility of a war is becoming increasingly real. ""The equation of deterrence is eroding and the attacks have increased significantly in scope and intensity,"" she said, adding that Israel appears to be preparing for a war with Hezbollah in the spring or the summer, with regular drills to prepare both troops and residents near the border. ""There could be a war with Hezbollah tonight,"" she said, but how things would develop is hard to tell. ""The fog of war, or miscalculation,"" she said, ""It's not clear to the Israeli public what would be a red line on when [the Israeli military] can strike against Hezbollah — would it be if they strike Haifa? If they killed 100 people?""Israel, she said, is dealing with an emboldened Hezbollah, and what appears to be a marked increase in Iran's capabilities. She dismissed the argument that this week's strikes from Lebanon are posturing or that Hezbollah doesn't want to get into a war. That was the thinking with Hamas, she said. But, she continued, the ""Israeli strategy that Hamas is deterred to attack Israel based on the price it would pay"" was proven wrong by the events of Oct. 7,  said Fainberg. ""We might have to rethink all the paradigms. ""The latest round of strikes risk further complicating efforts to secure a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, with Israeli media reporting that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not be sending a delegation to Egypt on Thursday to continue talks that began earlier this week.  And those talks could carry implications for Israel's northern border with Lebanon. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has said that any agreement on the shared border with Israel could only be reached in the event of an agreement between Israel and Hamas to pause the fighting in Gaza that to date, has killed more than 28,500 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The war has also inflamed long-simmering tensions between Israel and a number of Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon. Meanwhile, roughly 1. 4 million Palestinians in the town of Rafah, in southern Gaza, are awaiting possible evacuation orders from the Israeli military, which carried out an operation there on Monday to rescue two hostages. Health officials in Gaza say the Israeli raid resulted in the deaths of 74 people. The last cease-fire between Israel and Hamas was in November, and lasted seven days. During that time, Hamas released 50 of the hostages it abducted on Oct. 7, and Israel, in turn released 150 Palestinian prisoners.",npr_articles/article_11.txt,npr_results/article_11.txt.json
12,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/15/1231639347/israeli-forces-enter-main-hospital-in-southern-gaza-after-prolonged-standoff,"RAFAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli forces stormed the main hospital in southern Gaza on Thursday, hours after Israeli fire killed a patient and wounded six others inside the complex. The Israeli army said it was a limited operation seeking the remains of hostages taken by Hamas. The raid came a day after the army sought to evacuate thousands of displaced people who had taken shelter at Nasser Hospital in the city of Khan Younis, the focus of Israel's offensive against Hamas in recent weeks. The war shows no sign of ending, and the risk of a broader conflict is growing as Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah step up attacks after a particularly deadly exchange on Wednesday. The military said it had ""credible intelligence"" that Hamas had held hostages at the hospital and that the hostages' remains might still be inside. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesperson, said forces were conducting a ""precise and limited"" operation there and would not forcibly evacuate medics or patients. Israel accuses Hamas of using hospitals and other civilian structures to shield its fighters. A released hostage told The Associated Press last month that she and over two dozen other captives had been held in Nasser Hospital. International law prohibits the targeting of medical facilities, but they can lose those protections if they are used for military purposes. The troops were searching several hospital buildings after ordering all medical staff and patients to move into an older building in the compound, said Shaban Tabash, a nurse at the hospital. Doctors were unable to provide treatment to the patients in the building, which was not properly equipped. ""The situation of patients is difficult,"" Tabash told the AP. Separately, Israel launched airstrikes into southern Lebanon for a second day after killing 10 civilians and three Hezbollah fighters on Wednesday in response to a rocket attack that killed an Israeli soldier and wounded several others. It was the deadliest exchange of fire along the border since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Hezbollah — an ally of Hamas — have traded fire on a daily basis, raising the risks of a broader conflict. Hezbollah has not claimed responsibility for Wednesday's rocket attack. Sheikh Nabil Kaouk, a senior member of the group, said it is ""prepared for the possibility of expanding the war"" and would meet ""escalation with escalation, displacement with displacement, and destruction with destruction. ""Negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza, meanwhile, appear to have stalled, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the offensive until Hamas is destroyed and scores of hostages taken during the militants' Oct. 7 attack. Nasser Hospital has been the latest focus of Israeli military operations that have gutted Gaza's health sector as it struggles to treat a constant stream of people wounded in daily bombardments. Israeli troops, tanks and snipers have surrounded the hospital for at least a week, with heavy fire all around it. Several people have been killed inside the compound in recent days, according to health officials. Overnight, a strike slammed into one of the hospital's wards, and video showed medics scrambling to wheel patients on stretchers down a corridor filled with smoke or dust. A medic used a cellphone flashlight to illuminate a darkened room where a wounded man screamed in pain as gunfire echoed outside. The AP could not authenticate the video but the footage was consistent with its reporting. The strike killed one patient and wounded six others, all of whom were already being treated for previous wounds, Dr. Khaled Alserr, one of the remaining surgeons at Nasser Hospital, told the AP. ""The situation is escalating every hour and every minute,"" he said. Hours later, troops moved into the hospital compound, staff said. Footage posted online showed patients massed together in the old hospital building, with a row of beds lining a hallway. The international aid group Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French language acronym MSF, said its staff had to flee the hospital on Thursday, leaving patients behind, and that one staffer was detained at an Israeli checkpoint just outside the facility. The military had ordered the evacuation of Nasser Hospital and surrounding areas last month. But as with other health facilities, medics said patients were unable to safely leave or be relocated, and thousands of people displaced by fighting elsewhere remained there. ""People have been forced into an impossible situation,"" said Lisa Macheiner of MSF. ""Stay at Nasser Hospital against the Israeli military's orders and become a potential target or exit the compound into an apocalyptic landscape where bombings and evacuation orders are a part of daily life. ""The war began when Hamas militants burst through Israel's formidable defenses on Oct. 7 and rampaged through several communities, killing some 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostage. More than 100 of the captives were freed during a cease-fire last year in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners. Around 130 captives remain in Gaza, a fourth of whom are believed to be dead. Netanyahu has come under intense pressure from families of the hostages and the wider public to make a deal to secure their freedom, but his far-right coalition partners could bring down his government if he is seen as being too soft on Hamas. Israel responded to the Oct. 7 attack by launching one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history. Over 28,000 Palestinians have been killed, 80% of the population have fled their homes and a quarter are starving amid a worsening humanitarian catastrophe. Large areas in northern Gaza, the first target of the offensive, have been completely destroyed. Hamas has continued to attack Israeli forces in all parts of Gaza, and says it will not release all the remaining captives until Israel ends its offensive and withdraws. Hamas is also demanding the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners, including top militants. Netanyahu has rejected those demands, calling them ""delusional. "" He says Israel will soon expand its offensive into Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah, on the Egyptian border. Over half of Gaza's population of 2. 3 million has sought refuge in Rafah after fleeing fighting elsewhere in the coastal enclave. At least 28,663 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Over 68,000 people have been wounded in the war. Airstrikes late Wednesday in central Gaza killed at least 11 people, including four children and five women, according to hospital records. Relatives gathered around bodies wrapped in white shrouds outside Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah before the remains were placed in a truck to be taken for burial. One man struggled to let go, lying down and holding one of the bodies on the truck as he wept.",npr_articles/article_12.txt,npr_results/article_12.txt.json
13,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/14/1231310479/rafah-cease-fire-gaza-israel-hamas-cairo,"TEL AVIV, Israel - Will Israel execute a major incursion into Rafah, on the southern tip of the Gaza Strip, or will Hamas and Israel agree to a cease-fire instead? As of Wednesday, roughly 1. 4 million Palestinians sheltering in cramped conditions in Rafah were bracing for the potential of an Israeli assault on the city, but hoping for a diplomatic breakthrough as negotiators from the U. S. , Israel, Egypt and Qatar were said to be meeting in Cairo for talks on a plan to pause the fighting.  In Rafah, which sits on the border with Egypt, families that barely had time to set up their tents are already packing up. Many have arrived in Rafah after fleeing Israeli military strikes in the northern swath of the Gaza Strip. ""When we came here, this whole area was empty, then maybe after three or four days, there was no room for even one person to come with his family,"" said  Aisha Abdallah Al-Najjar. She's from the village of Qizan an-Najjar in the Khan Younis governorate in southern Gaza, where Hamas and the Israeli military have been engaging in heavy fighting. She points to the crowded camp around her and outlines the hourly struggle for survival. ""The food, we run after it in line, we take turns for water and bathrooms,"" she said, adding that her surroundings are so crowded that people take turns even when going for a walk. ""Everything is by turn. It's humiliating. It's crazy,"" said al-Najjar.   Khaled Atef Ashour is sheltering in Rafah with his family, but to him, it hardly feels like he's safe from anything, especially after the Israeli military staged an operation in the city on Monday to rescue two hostages. Health officials in Gaza said the Israeli raid resulted in the deaths of 74 people. ""There was intense bombing on Rafah . . . 50 rockets fell in less than 20 minutes,"" said Ashour, who is also from Khan Younis, where  the last remaining large hospital has been ordered evacuated by the Israeli military. Thousands of civilians had sought refuge at the hospital, but were being told to leave against the backdrop of fierce combat. Israel has accused Hamas of using the hospital as cover for their operations — a claim  denied by hospital officials and Hamas. So going back home isn't an option for Ashour. As Rafah braces for a potential Israeli assault, negotiators were reportedly meeting in Cairo Wednesday to continue discussions around a possible cease-fire. If successful, the talks could clear the way for a break in the fighting for up to six weeks, as well as allow for more humanitarian aid into Gaza. Talks could also lead to another exchange of Palestinian prisoners and Israeli hostages. But in Rafah, cease-fire talks have not been top of mind for many residents. Instead, there has been a steady flow of headlines about strikes in Gaza and fighting between Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Israeli military in northern Israel. In other words, more fighting. More death. More displacement. ""Every three, four, five years, war, war, war, war. We are exhausted, said Ashour.  ""We are tired, officially. ""Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week ordered the military to come up with an evacuation plan for Rafah in preparation for a ground offensive there. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, more than half of Gaza's total population is now crammed into Rafah, and military operations there ""could lead to a slaughter in Gaza. ""  Netanyahu says Rafah is Hamas's last stronghold in Gaza, and that ""Those who say that under no circumstances should we enter Rafah are basically saying lose the war, keep Hamas there. ""President Biden has warned Netanyahu against going into Rafah without a ""credible and executable plan"" to protect the lives of civilians who have paid a high price since Israel began its military offensive in Gaza in response to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants. About 1,200 people were killed and 240 were taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7. In the months of fighting since then, at least 28, 576 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Initially, the Israeli military asked the residents of Gaza City, in the north of the Gaza Strip, to evacuate south. But as the fighting has drawn on, that southern push has brought many Palestinians right up to the Rafah border with Egypt, which remains closed. The question for many in Rafah now is: Is it worth it to move again if a temporary cease-fire could bring a moment of relief? If not, where to go?  Philippe Lazzarini, Commissioner-General for UNRWA, the U. N. relief agency operating in Gaza, on Tuesday emphasized that ""there is absolutely no safe place in Rafah anymore. ""While it remains unclear if or when the Israeli military may move into Rafah, some Palestinians in the city are already packing up their tents and belongings in preparation for another forced evacuation, even as they remain uncertain as to where they could possibly go to be safe. ""We no longer feel safe in any area in Gaza,"" said Umm Naif al-Zaza, who has been displaced twice in the past few months, and said she's seen nothing but ""suffering and humiliation"" everywhere she's been. ""Every other day, we're raising a tent and setting up a tent, and then pack up,"" she added. ""If there's a truce, God willing, we want to return to our homes in Gaza. "" The only cease-fire in this conflict was in November. Negotiated with the help of Qatar, it lasted a week and saw the release of  50 hostages from Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. It also allowed for some humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. Like al-Zaza, Khaled Atef Ashour's also asks God for peace, but more specifically, he wants more engagement from Arab countries to bring about a ceasefire. ""I'm asking the Arab countries, the donor countries, and the countries that have a heart and a conscience and feel for the people of Palestine . . . find me a solution. Find me a solution.

14,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/13/1231099026/israel-gaza-cairo-hamas-ceasfire-negotiations,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Officials from Israel, Egypt, Qatar and the U. S. are meeting in Cairo for negotiations around a second cease-fire in Gaza and the release of hostages being held by Hamas.  The talks in the Egyptian capital on Tuesday were expected to center on a plan that would pause the fighting in Gaza for up to six weeks, and clear the way for another exchange of Palestinian prisoners and Israeli hostages. The high-stakes meeting is taking place as Israel signals it may soon launch a ground invasion in Rafah, on the southern tip of Gaza, where nearly 1. 5 million Palestinians are sheltering. On Monday, the Israeli military said special forces rescued two hostages from a complex in Rafah, but Gaza health officials said the raid resulted in the deaths of at least 74 people. Rafah is on Gaza's border with Egypt, which has threatened to suspend its peace treaty with Israel in the event of a major offensive on Rafah. Among the U. S. officials who were expected in Cairo for Tuesday's negotiations was C. I. A. director William J. Burns. Since the start of the war, the U. S. has dispatched several high-level envoys to the region in hopes of securing a diplomatic breakthrough, but those efforts have proven an uphill climb. Speaking from the White House on Monday, President Biden said key elements of a plan were ""on the table,"" but said ""gaps remain"" as he encouraged parties to keep working toward a deal. Biden reiterated his support for Israel in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants that killed 1,200 people. Some 134 hostages are still being held by Hamas, with the public outcry to bring them home putting increasing pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. At the same time, Biden also spoke more extensively about the ""unimaginable pain and loss"" by civilians in Gaza. More than 28,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its offensive into the territory, according to health officials in Gaza. And with the war entering its fifth month, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire, with widespread reports of shortages of food, clean water and medical supplies. Biden has emphasized that Israel should not proceed with a military operation in Rafah without a ""credible plan"" for the safety of the more than 1 million people sheltering there. An earlier cease-fire in November, which was mediated by Qatar, resulted in the release of 50 hostages from Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. It also allowed for some humanitarian aid to enter Gaza, which had been essentially blocked off from aid since Oct. 7. The cease-fire was originally negotiated for four days but was twice extended. Hamas, which was not expected to attend the negotiations in Cairo, rejected an Israeli proposal earlier this month because it did not include the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops. Prime Minister Netanyahu last week rejected the counter offer, which would leave Hamas in control of the Gaza Strip as ""delusional. """,npr_articles/article_14.txt,npr_results/article_14.txt.json

16,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/12/1230949031/netherlands-halts-f-35-jet-parts-israel,"BERLIN — A Dutch appeals court has ruled that the government of the Netherlands should halt shipments of F-35 fighter jet components to Israel because of the Israeli military's continued assault on the Gaza Strip. ""The court finds that there is a clear risk that Israel's F-35 fighter jets might be used in the commission of serious violations of international humanitarian law,"" the court said on Monday. The Dutch affiliate of the international humanitarian group Oxfam, along with two other nongovernmental human rights groups that sued the government in December, welcomed the decision. ""This positive ruling by the judge is very good news, especially for civilians in Gaza,"" Oxfam said in a statement. ""It is an important step to force the Dutch government to adhere to international law. ""Israel denies it is violating international law, saying it is fighting in Gaza to crush Hamas and secure the release of hostages after the Palestinian militant group's deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel. But the court said, ""Israel's attacks on Gaza have resulted in a disproportionate number of civilian casualties, including thousands of children. ""It ordered the Dutch government to enforce the decision within seven days and said the state has eight weeks to appeal the decision. The government says it will implement the decision but that it's lodging an appeal to the Dutch Supreme Court. ""In the government's view, the distribution of American F-35 parts is not unlawful,"" the government said in a statement. It said the court failed to take into account the state's role in determining foreign policy. The Israel division of Lockheed Martin, maker of the F-35, said it is evaluating what impact the court decision could have on its supply chain, The Times of Israel reported. The United Kingdom faces a similar suit, brought by two human rights groups, trying to prevent weapons exports to Israel. The court announced its decision as Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte is on a trip to Israel to discuss the conflict with Israeli and Palestinian Authority leaders. The news followed a night in which Israel carried out airstrikes in the Gaza Strip that killed at least 50 people, according to health officials in the territory. The Israeli military said on Monday its special forces rescued two hostages held there. Israel's bombardment has killed more than 28,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry there. It launched the military campaign after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack killed 1,200 people and took some 240 people hostage, according to Israeli officials.

N. agency's Gaza headquarters, and dissent against Hamas in Gaza is now widespread and out in the open, voiced alongside fury with Israel. An attack near the southern Gaza city of Rafah took place late Thursday, Feb. 8, resulting in at least 13 people being killed. Rafah is where more than a million Palestinians have taken refuge because Israel had previously told Gazans they would be safe there. Meanwhile, the U. S. ambassador to the U. N. , Linda Thomas-Greenfield, stated that due to Israel's obligation to keep civilians safe, a planned military operation in Rafah ""cannot proceed.

18,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/12/1230362633/gaza-food-hunger-israel-protests,"KEREM SHALOM, Israel — From some of these parts, Gaza is a stone's throw away. If you look across the vast farm fields, you can see the buildings of Gaza rising from the horizon.  Sometimes, you can also see plumes of smoke in the sky, a reminder that just a few miles from here, a war is raging. A group of around 100 protesters have set up on the road leading into Gaza, just a couple of hundred feet from a row of aid trucks that sit idle in front of a tall concrete barricade. Israeli soldiers stand on a hill, watching from a distance, as the protesters wave Israeli flags. ""Don't give aid to rapists,"" they chant. ""Don't give aid to butchers. "" Shortly after the war between Israel and Hamas started last October, aid groups warned that the population of Gaza is extremely vulnerable. In December, the World Food Program said the whole population of Gaza — more than 2 million people — was facing a food crisis. And when the Famine Review Committee, an international group of experts who analyze hunger, looked at data collected during the ceasefire in November, they warned if more aid did not reach the Gaza Strip, the situation could tip into famine. More recently, the U. N. relief agency in Gaza said they had already found pockets of starvation and hunger in northern Gaza, where an aid truck had not arrived since January 23. But over the past couple of weeks, a small movement has emerged in Israel that is intent on stopping aid from reaching Gaza. At the Kerem Shalom border crossing, they've thrown themselves in front of trucks. For three days in a row one week, they managed to stop all trucks from crossing. When the Israeli government ordered the military to clear the roads, protesters moved north to the port of Ashdod, where they blockaded other trucks. On a recent Monday, they gathered once again across the border from Gaza. ""The people don't want this aid to get to Gaza, because it doesn't help anything,"" said Rachel Touitou, 32. ""We want this war to end and we want Hamas to be gone. "" Many of the protesters in the crowd spoke of Hamas, the militant group that controls the Gaza strip and launched an attack on Oct. 7th that killed some 1,200 people in Israel, in the same breath that they speak about the Palestinian population. When asked by a reporter if she felt no compassion for the civilians in Gaza, Touitou shrugged. ""Should I have mercy on the children of today who will be the terrorists of tomorrow?"" Touitou said. At the beginning of this war, the Israeli government used similar language. ""I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip,"" Israel's Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said. ""There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly. This is the ISIS of Gaza. "" Relentless air bombardment followed, displacing nearly the entire population and killing almost 27,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry. At the same time, Israel started limiting the number of trucks that were allowed into Gaza. The international community began advocating for more aid and the Israeli government softened its language and lifted the complete siege. The military denied there was hunger in Gaza and that it was still limiting aid.   But Miriam Marmur, of Gisha, an Israeli organization that advocates for the freedom of movement of Palestinians, says the data shows otherwise. ""We recently reached the mark of over 10,000 truckloads of aid that has gone into Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7th, and that is more or less equivalent to what's been going in per month prior to the war,"" she said. The Israeli military did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but Israel has blamed aid groups for the bottleneck. The United Nations' humanitarian agency says the Israeli military is allowing only a fraction of aid missions to make their way through checkpoints. Sometimes, the U. N. says, aid convoys are allowed in only to find out the routes designated by the Israeli military ""proved to be unpassable. "" Marmur says Israel also adds to the delays by instituting a host of limitations on what kinds of goods can come in, where they have to be bought, and even where they should be transported through. ""All of these things impact aid operations and they impact a person in Gaza who needs food,"" she said. To Alex de Waal, a professor at Tufts University who studies mass starvation, this all sounds eerily familiar. During its civil war from 2020 to 2022, Ethiopia erected a de facto blockade on the region of Tigray. For two years, the government insisted that there was no hunger in Tigray and that its forces were not stopping aid trucks from entering the war zone. The numbers showed otherwise, the international community protested and experts warned over and over of an imminent famine. But month after month, trucks full of aid  languished on highways. Ethiopia turned off the internet and phone lines while its military laid siege to the region, destroying health facilities, infrastructure  and schools. The international community was incapable of stopping it and in the end, scientists estimate that some 300,000 Ethiopians died of hunger or disease caused by malnutrition. ""One thing that was sort of learned by those who inflict famine is that you can get away with it,"" De Waal said. And he says that is critical because hunger is different from warfare. If the bombs stop, the killing stops. But even if food begins to flow into an area under siege, people do not stop dying. ""If you cause that much damage to the infrastructure required to sustain life, it's going to be quite some time before people stop dying,"" he said. He compares it to stopping a speeding freight train. Indeed, 15 months after the war ended in Ethiopia, a population made vulnerable by the blockade is being ravaged by drought. Hundreds have died of starvation in recent months. De Waal fears the situation in Gaza has the potential to be just as bad. He notes that the group of global experts tasked with determining whether a region is suffering famine is issuing similar warnings. In both cases, early on in the conflict, they warned that nearly half a million people were ""facing catastrophic acute food insecurity conditions,"" meaning those people are at risk of starving to death. In Kerem Shalom, Noga Alfassa crisscrosses the field with a poster-sized picture of her aunt hanging from her neck.  Her aunt, Maya Goren, 56, was kidnapped by Hamas during the Oct. 7th attacks. Alfassa says her uncle was killed that same day and Goren was badly injured. The government has told her that Goren has died but Hamas is still holding her body. ""I am here not because I want to starve a nation,"" she said almost in a whisper. Back in November, she said, Hamas agreed to release hostages in exchange for more humanitarian aid. ""The only card we have to play here is that of humanitarian aid,"" she said. It is painful, said Alfassa, to think that her actions here could hurt a family in Gaza. But she said she's also seen images on TV of Palestinians celebrating Israeli losses. If a blockade inflicts just enough suffering for them to reject Hamas, she says, the blockade will be worth it. ""A bit more suffering now,"" she says. ""May just stop more suffering in the future.

19,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/12/1230828344/israeli-military-rescued-hostages-gaza,"RAFAH, Gaza — The Israeli military said on Monday that special forces rescued two Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Heavy airstrikes were conducted during the night. Hospital officials in Gaza said that at least 50 people were killed in the strikes while more bodies were being brought to hospitals. ""This was a complex rescue operation under fire in the heart of Rafah, based on highly sensitive and valuable intelligence,"" said the Israeli military in a statement. Israel's military identified the rescued hostages as Fernando Simon Marman, 60, and Louis Har, 70. Both were kidnapped by Hamas militants on Oct. 7 from the Nir Yitzhak kibbutz, the Israeli military said. Both were held on the second floor of a home in the city of Rafah, according to the the Israeli military, which said that a special forces team broke inside the home and engaged in a firefight, killing militants. The hostages were then airlifted to Israel and the military said they were in good medical shape and taken to a hospital.  The operation was the second successful Israeli hostage rescue during the war. Israel says more than 100 hostages taken during the Oct. 7 attacks are still being held in Gaza. More than 1,200 people were killed in the attacks, according to Israel. The raid came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signals that Israeli forces will soon launch a broader offensive inside Rafah to root out Hamas militants from the city. On Sunday, the White House said that President Biden cautioned Netanyahu about moving into Rafah, telling him that ""a military operation in Rafah should not proceed without a credible and executable plan for ensuring the safety of and support for the more than one million people sheltering there. "" It was the first time that Biden had publicly cautioned Israel against its planned operation in Rafah. But with the bombardment intensifying in the area, people in Rafah have been left asking where should they go. Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza, borders Egypt, and normally has a population of about 250,000 people. But the United Nations says that more than half of Gaza's population of over 2 million people are now crammed in Rafah, after fleeing Israeli bombardment further north in the region. Among those displaced by the fighting is Jihad Abu Amer, who told NPR that he and his family were forced to flee to Rafah and they now worry about a broader Israeli invasion of the city. ""This operation will be a massacre because the city is so dense,"" said Abu Amer. ""It's a sad city and a poor city and destroyed, and it's never mentioned on the map except during war,"" he continued. Yousef al-Syersawi's family was displaced twice — once to Khan Younis and then to Rafah. ""Their threats are to be taken seriously,"" he said of the signals of an Israeli invasion. ""Because of the reality we've lived, it isn't far fetched that the occupation forces enter Rafah and finish their military operation""As the city's residents await what will happen, life in Rafah has become increasingly difficult. The U. N. has said that Rafah has produced a year's worth of garbage in the past three months and there is a scarcity of food, clean water and sanitation that's leading to disease. Palestinians also complain of a lack of goods and high prices for things that are for sale. ""The citizen has become at a loss for what to do,"" said al-Syersawi. ""Face the occupation or the very high prices. ""On Friday, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered his military to come up with a plan to evacuate Rafah in preparation for a possible ground invasion. ""Where are we supposed to go?"" said Zeyad Abouloun. ""Someone answer me that question, the whole world is against us — America and Israel and the Arabs — where are we supposed to go?""Egypt has refused to take in refugees from Rafah, saying that Israel wants an expulsion of Palestinians with no guarantees that they will allow them to go back. Egypt is also worried it will have a humanitarian crisis on its hands that it won't be able to handle. ""We wish that Egypt would shelter us even if temporarily,"" said Abu Amer. ""And when the battle is over, they can return us. ""But Palestinians in Rafah say that there is is only place they want to go back to. ""We hope this war will end, and people go back to their homes,"" Abu Amer said. ""We don't want anything else and we want this blood bath to end. ""Meanwhile, there are continuing negotiations on a ceasefire and hostage deal slated to start in Cairo on Tuesday, where U. S. , Egyptian, Israeli and Hamas officials are expected to attend. The talks come as the Israeli military said on Saturday that it found a network of tunnels under the Gaza headquarters of the main U. N. Palestinian relief agency, known as UNRWA. In video released by the army, tunnels were shown lined with electrical wires and rooms holding electrical supplies. The Israeli army accuses UNRWA of supplying the tunnels with electricity. UNRWA said in a statement Saturday that it did not know what was underneath the headquarters, but the reports were worth an investigation. The U. S. paused its funding to UNRWA after Israeli allegations that some of its employees were involved in the Oct. 7 attack. Now, UNRWA said it will run out of funding and be unable to keep providing aid by the end of February.",npr_articles/article_19.txt,npr_results/article_19.txt.json

Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told NPR that Israel has an obligation to keep civilians safe, and that under current conditions, a planned military operation there ""cannot proceed. ""The flow of humanitarian assistance continues to lag far behind the needs of the nearly 1. 5 million Palestinians who have taken shelter in Rafah. On Sunday, President Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that ""a military operation in Rafah should not proceed without a credible and executable plan for ensuring the safety of and support for the more than one million people sheltering there,"" according to a readout of the call between the two men provided by the White House. Meanwhile, the primary agency delivering aid on the ground, UNRWA, continues to be embroiled in scandal. On Saturday, the Israeli military said it found a network of Hamas tunnels under the agency's Gaza headquarters. The commissioner general of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, said the agency was unaware of what was underneath the building and that the allegations ""merit an independent inquiry. ""The beleaguered organization faces a crisis of funding, as top donor nations, including the United States, have moved to suspend their funding. This came in response to accusations leveled by Israel in late January that 12 UNRWA employees had direct involvement in the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, which killed some 1,200 people in Israel. In an interview on Friday with NPR diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen, Thomas-Greenfield spoke about the U. S. position on Israel's plans to ramp up military operations in Rafah, and the efforts to ensure humanitarian aid continues to reach civilians on the ground. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity and includes extended web-only questions and answers. Michele Kelemen: Israel seems to be turning its attention to the south, to Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are sheltered and they're already displaced by the fighting. Is the U. S. laying out any red lines for the Israelis on that? Because I know you've heard a lot of concern at the U. N. about that situation. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield: Look, we have been absolutely clear that under the current circumstances in Rafah, a military operation now in that area cannot proceed. And that would dramatically exacerbate the humanitarian emergency that we're all seeking to alleviate right now. Israel has an obligation to ensure that civilians, that their civilian population is safe and that they're secure and that they have access to humanitarian aid and to basic services. And I think you heard the secretary, [Antony Blinken,] make those statements clearly during his meetings and in his engagements with the press when he was there. Kelemen: And you must be hearing a lot of concern at the U. N. about that, right?Thomas-Greenfield: I am hearing those concerns every single day. And what we have tried to do is keep our colleagues briefed on what is happening on the ground so that we don't take actions in the Security Council that might jeopardize the very sensitive negotiations that are taking place that we hope will lead to an extensive pause in the fighting, lead to the hostages returning to their families, and allow for humanitarian assistance to get in to Palestinians who are in desperate need. Kelemen: On the U. N. agency that aids Palestinians, UNRWA, is the U. S. satisfied with the steps UNRWA is taking to investigate allegations that some of its staffers actually took part in the Hamas attack on Oct. 7? And will the U. S. make sure that UNRWA doesn't run out of money?Thomas-Greenfield: Look, the U. S. has always been a strong supporter of humanitarian programs that are facilitated by UNRWA. And we have, over the course of this past few weeks, been extraordinarily saddened and disappointed that individuals who work for UNRWA participated in the heinous attack on the 7th of October. So for that reason, we paused our assistance. But we are continuing to work with the U. N. in their effort to investigate. I know that the U. N. office of investigations are engaged in an investigation right now of those who were involved in the attack. And the secretary-general just announced a commission of three Nordic NGOs who will be working with former [French] Foreign Minister [Catherine] Colonna on addressing some of the reforms and the neutrality of UNRWA moving forward. And so we'll continue to support those efforts, we'll continue to look for paths to provide needed humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people. UNRWA is the only international organization with the capacity, with the infrastructure to provide that assistance. So whether it's through funding from the U. S. or funding from others, we will work to ensure that assistance continues to flow in to the people of Gaza. Kelemen: Others, though, have kind of followed your lead in pausing aid, so I wonder if you're sending any message. Thomas-Greenfield: I keep hearing that others followed our lead, but others saw the situation on the ground that we saw on the ground and made their own independent decisions about what they wanted to do. But we know that a number of countries and organizations have not cut off funding yet, and we obligated a significant amount of funding to UNRWA already for their 2024 program. So we're going to wait to see what the assessments show and then we'll make a decision on how to move forward. But let me be clear. We will find a way to ensure that we continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people.",npr_articles/article_20.txt,npr_results/article_20.txt.json

22,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/08/1229749527/in-gaza-anger-grows-at-hamas,"RAFAH, Gaza Strip — ""Hamas . . . has destroyed us,"" says Adnan Abdelaal, who has fled for safety four times in the past four months of war. First, he escaped Israeli bombing on his Gaza City neighborhood. Then he sheltered in a United Nations school until it was hit 40 days later. Then he fled to central Gaza, then farther south to Khan Younis, then even farther south to Rafah, escaping each time the Israeli military got closer. He is in the same clothes he has worn for the past month, living out of a backpack and searching every night for a new place to sleep. ""I don't know if they thought about it, and what would happen to us,"" Abdelaal says about Hamas' decision to attack Israel on Oct. 7. ""We didn't receive any warning to leave. ""Hamas has not tolerated dissent among Gazans in the 17 years it has ruled the tiny territory, choked by an Israeli-led blockade. But dissent against the Islamist militant group is now widespread and out in the open, voiced alongside Gazans' fury with Israel. ""Enough Israel, enough Hamas,"" Abdelaal says. Hamas' surprise Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel was the deadliest attack in Israeli history, killing 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. It prompted Israel's deadliest war on Palestinians, killing more than 27,000 people in Gaza, according to Gaza health officials. Entire areas of Gaza have been reduced to wastelands. Most of the population has fled their homes, many living in flimsy tents in the rainy winter. Cheers rang out on the streets of Rafah this week after Hamas said it responded in a ""positive spirit"" to a proposal for a cease-fire. But Hamas still drew criticism from some Gazans, for submitting a host of demands for shaping Gaza's reconstruction and future. ""We are not happy with their reply at all,"" says Jamal, who did not want to use his full name to avoid retribution from Hamas. He lost his home to Israeli bombing in Gaza City and is sheltering in Rafah. ""Hamas is focusing mostly on remaining on the chair, ruling Gaza mainly. Because they don't care about people in Gaza, they don't care about their suffering. "" Several demonstrations have taken place in recent weeks in Gaza, expressing frustration with Hamas over the war. At a demonstration in the city of Khan Younis, Palestinian protesters singled out the leaders of Israel and Hamas. ""Netanyahu and Sinwar, enough war and enough destruction,"" they chanted, in a protest captured on film and shared on social media. ""The people demand a cease-fire. ""Hamas' popularity has soared in the other Palestinian territory, the West Bank, since the war began. In past Israel-Hamas wars, Gazans under bombardment also rallied around Hamas for standing up to years of Israeli oppression. But this war is different. It's the deadliest conflict Palestinians have faced in their history, coupled with Israel's large-scale destruction of homes and infrastructure across Gaza. About 85% of the population, according to the U. N. , have now fled their homes and are sheltering in tents, schools and overcrowded buildings. Many in Gaza liken it to the foundational Arab-Israeli war of 1948 and the mass Palestinian displacement that came with the establishment of Israel, what Palestinians call the Nakba, Arabic for catastrophe. Hamas still has supporters in Gaza. A recent poll found 57% of Gazans support Hamas' decision to attack on Oct. 7. Most of the Palestinians surveyed said they had not seen the videos of Hamas' attacks on Israelis that day and didn't think Hamas committed atrocities. But even supporters of Hamas launching the attack say the group misjudged the consequences. Abdelsalam Al-Ghoul, a 30-year-old Palestinian who fled his home in Gaza, called Hamas' attack an ""honorable act"" against Israeli oppression, but says Hamas ""greatly misjudged the situation,"" because Iran and Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, didn't join the attack, diminishing its results. He criticizes Hamas for preparing its fighters for the war, without preparing its civilians. ""The resistance says it's ready for rounds of combat for months and years,"" Al-Ghoul says. ""So are we, but provide us with our daily bread, so we resist together. ""It takes hours to wait in bread lines at bakeries, which are short on flour, fuel and cooking gas. ""[Hamas] should give consideration to their people,"" says Suheir Safi, amid the wafting smoke of a mud oven, where Palestinians baked bread near a tent. ""Every shepherd is responsible for his flock. ""On Facebook, many Gazans have been alluding to their frustration with Hamas' leader Yahya Sinwar. ""A captain takes the ship to where the people want. A pirate takes the ship to where he wants,"" Sami Allhelou wrote. ""An entire generation in Gaza never saw a tank in their lives. The crazy man brought the tanks to the center of the refugee camp because of stupidity,"" Mohanad Mehrez wrote. The public opinion poll found 51% of Gazans believe Hamas will survive the war and govern Gaza, despite Israel's goal to crush it. Israel says it has destroyed 17 out of Hamas' 24 battalions in Gaza. But Hamas still maintains a fighting presence on the battlefield, and has even reasserted itself as a governing force, paying partial salaries to civil servants and sending police officers to patrol in areas where Israeli troops have withdrawn. Sinwar, the Hamas leader whom Israel has vowed to kill, remains alive, in hiding, leading negotiations with Israel for a hostage-prisoner exchange and cease-fire. ""Hamas, they consider that they are the winner in this war,"" says Tholfikar Swairjo, a pharmacist in Gaza who was previously a leader in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a leftist Palestinian political faction. ""They didn't lose the war because . . . until now, Hamas is Hamas. ""The ""bigger war,"" Swairjo says, is what Hamas will face after the fighting is over: the colossal task of rebuilding a decimated Gaza. Hamas cannot do that without international cooperation. Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by the U. S. and European Union. It has been isolated since it won 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections in Gaza and took the territory by force in 2007, driving out the Western-backed Palestinian Authority from the territory. Since then, Israel has led a blockade on Gaza, restricting trade and travel. This is the fifth war Hamas and Israel have fought since Hamas took over Gaza. The U. S. , Qatar and Egypt are now involved in negotiations over what the future Palestinian leadership would look like when the war is over. To move forward, Swairjo thinks Hamas will have to change from an outlier opposition force to a participant in the internationally recognized Palestinian movement, the Palestine Liberation Organization, or PLO, which is committed to the goal of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. ""Hamas, they are smart enough to understand what's happening and what is coming in the future. Because of that, they will change,"" Swairjo says. ""People will obligate them to change . . . they will not accept to have another war, another catastrophe. People will not accept to continue this forever. ""That includes Swairjo himself. He has lost his main pharmacy, his livelihood, his house and his father's house to Israeli bombings in the last four months. ""I lost everything,"" he says. ""I want Hamas to do something for me.

S. service members, killing a Kata'ib Hezbollah commander responsible for directly planning and participating in attacks on U. S. forces in the region,"" U. S. Central Command said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter. The Iraqi military command said it was investigating an attack on a civilian car that killed the passengers inside. Video verified by an Iraqi Interior Ministry official showed an SUV engulfed in flames but with the frame still intact. The U. S. military said, ""There are no indications of collateral damage or civilian casualties at this time. ""A Telegram channel used by Iraq's militias that are now part of Iraqi government forces announced that a commander had been killed. The drone strike took place in a crowded commercial and residential neighborhood in east Baghdad, al-Mashtal, which is also the site of one of Kataib Hezbollah's offices. Explosions were heard miles away in the Iraqi capital. A former senior U. S. military official said the strike appeared to have used a version of the Hellfire missile called an R9X with an inert rather than explosive warhead used in U. S. counterterrorism strikes to limit wider impact. The former official spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to speak publicly about Iran-backed militias. Kataib Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks on U. S. forces in Iraq. But the group said last week it would no longer target U. S. troops, just before American warplanes hit militia sites in both Iraq and Syria. Security officials in Baghdad braced for anti-U. S. demonstrations after the strike, blocking streets near the heavily protected U. S. Embassy. Some Iraqi members of parliament said the strike provided even more reason to demand that U. S. forces leave the country. Iraq and the U. S. have begun negotiations on the future of the U. S. -led coalition in Iraq, which includes roughly 2,500 U. S. troops. The United States would like to maintain a presence, although a smaller one, to help keep the Islamic State group from resurfacing. But militia and political leaders say the U.

Netanyahu called the plan ""delusional"" and noted that it would have left Hamas in power of the Gaza Strip at the end of the phased truce. ""It will just invite another massacre,"" Netanyahu said at a news conference hours after meeting Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Blinken says he's in the region to press for a cease-fire that allows more aid into Gaza and a release of hostages held by Hamas there. Hamas also wants the release of thousands of Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials. Israel launched an air and ground campaign in Gaza, killing more than 27,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Netanyahu said a lasting peace could only be achieved through a ""total victory"" of the Israeli military against Hamas, arguing that anything short of that would only embolden Iran-backed militias across the region. ""Without total victory, Iran and its terror proxies — Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and others — will be emboldened to subvert moderate states in the Middle East; they'll threaten the entire free world,"" he said. ""Only total victory will prevent that. And total victory is within our reach,"" he added, saying such a result was a matter of months, not years. Blinken said there was still room for negotiations to continue, telling reporters that ""while there are some clear non-starters to Hamas' response, we do think it creates space for agreement to be reached and we will work at that relentlessly until we get there. ""Hamas' proposal on Tuesday had raised hopes in Gaza of a possible end or pause to the fighting. Thousands of people have fled to the town of Rafah, on the coastal enclave's southernmost border with Egypt, to escape the Israeli onslaught, and have nowhere left to go. Israel's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, hinted earlier in the week that the Israeli military could move there next. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres warned Wednesday that an Israeli offensive into Rafah ""would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences. ""Blinken said he raised concerns about this with Israeli officials during his visit and reminded them that they have an obligation to protect civilians, although he he has said that many times before.

26,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/07/1229739870/iran-us-airstrikes-middle-east-war-proxy,"When the U. S. launched airstrikes over the past week in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, the idea was to send a message to another country: Iran. And the message, per the White House, is: rein in your proxy groups — groups that Iran funds, arms or otherwise supports. This prompts questions: is it clear Iran can do that? How much control does Iran have over the so-called ""Axis of Resistance""?Norman Roule — a 34-year veteran of the CIA, and a former mission manager for Iran for the Director of National Intelligence — speaks to All Things Considered host Mary Louise Kelly about these pressing questions. Roule says Iran isn't actually seeking to control the proxy groups, and it's not reasonable to expect that U. S. strikes will accomplish the goal of getting Iran to rein them in. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Mary Louise Kelly: Understanding there is a range, understanding that the Houthis are not Hezbollah, etc. , broadly speaking, how much control does Iran have over its proxies?Norman Roule: Broadly speaking, Iran has sufficient control over its proxies to control or modulate their behavior because it controls their weaponry, their funding and it has significant political relationships with their key leaders. Kelly: And how do we know that? I mean, when the U. S. contends that Iran is providing money and weapons and intelligence, how do they know?Roule: Well, the evidence is significant, and it's even open information. We have literally tons of weapons made in Iran captured from boats originating in Iran or weapons that have been fired against U. S. and partner forces with made-in-Tehran nomenclature. These weapons are not available, for the most part, anywhere else in the world. They're not available in an open market. Likewise, Iran's leaders tout their support for all of the militias. There are frequent visits by militia leaders to visit Iran's leaders, and they broadcast these meetings. And last, the militia leaders thank Iran for their support. I suppose I should also add that, periodically, there is evidence that an Iranian is present in various militia meetings. Kelly: What about money trails? Is the CIA doing foreign asset tracking, that type of thing?Roule: The U. S. intelligence community has a robust and generally successful capacity to follow money. But when Iran provides its cash in bags of money delivered via aircraft couriers, that's obviously much more difficult to follow. What's more easy to understand is when significant sanctions are placed on Iran, we are able to determine — and proxies complain publicly —that their budgets are reduced because of sanctions pressures on Iran. Kelly: Characterize what kind of control Iran has. Like, does Iran control what and where these groups would target?Roule: Well, the control will vary by group and by actor, but I think it's important to begin with an understanding that control is not what Iran seeks. Iran seeks the product of militia actions, not the process of controlling them. And Iran's limited personnel that it applies to this target abroad means that it can't be there day by day. Your listeners may want to think of Iran as an arsonist that then subcontracts out to other arsonists it believes will be ideologically and energetically pursuing Iran's goals. And then Iran empowers them with money, political support, weaponry, training and lets them do what they do because their success is Iran's success. Kelly: Can we make this concrete? Is there an example you can think of where Iran told one of these groups, ""Hey, stop, knock it off,"" and they complied?Roule: There is reporting that during the U. S. presence in Iraq, that warnings by the United States, from then-Secretary of Defense Panetta, reduced the number of attacks Iran and its personnel were making against U. S. forces in that country. Kelly: So at the end of the day, these retaliatory strikes by the U. S. — you believe they have the potential of accomplishing the goal that has been laid out of getting Iran to rein in its proxies?Roule: No. And I don't think that that's something that's reasonable to expect. The goals of the strikes conducted by the U. S. will certainly degrade proxy capacity. There's no question about that, and that will improve the safety of our personnel in the region. They will, to a limited extent, disrupt proxy activity as proxies leave these areas because they don't want to be caught in the attacks. But none of these strikes touch equities important to the leadership of Iran or proxies themselves. Until that is done, you can't expect to shift proxy behavior. Kelly: And give us a little bit of a ranking — you know, there's Hezbollah; there's the Houthis; there's Hamas; there's groups in Iraq — in terms of which are most closely allied with Tehran. Roule: I'm not sure that's a profitable way of looking at it simply because Iran has supported Sunni as well as Shia actors, the Taliban, al-Qaida — there's no question Iran has enabled their operations, but they would have the loosest relationship with Tehran. Lebanese Hezbollah would be the closest to Tehran as a large structure. But there were certainly some elements of the Iraqi militias, of which there are a number, who would be ideologically, of varying degrees, associated with Tehran. And of course, the Houthis would be the most distant. But again, for Iran, the goal of pressure against the United States' Western partners and Israel is more important than any specific degree of ideological command and control. Kelly: And one last question, just to focus on Hamas, which is a little bit of an outlier here as a Sunni Muslim group — Iran and these others that we're talking about are Shiite — what does that relationship look like with Iran?Roule: Well, the relationship has been mixed. For example, during the Arab Spring, when attacks were taking place against Bashar al-Assad, the Iranians were quite unhappy with Hamas' refusal to support Assad, and that relationship cooled. But nonetheless, the relationship returned, and Iran has provided it with millions of dollars, advanced training, training in Iran and some degree of weaponry. Over the years, Iran has provided this weaponry through Red Sea weapons pipelines and reportedly through training camps in Sudan, which were shut down some years ago by U. S. diplomacy.",npr_articles/article_26.txt,npr_results/article_26.txt.json
27,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/06/1229581068/hamas-response-gaza-ceasefire-qatar-israel,"Hamas on Tuesday responded to a proposal for a cease-fire in Gaza in return for a hostage release in a ""positive"" manner, said the Qatari mediator who helped draw up the plan. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who has been a key mediator in the efforts to end Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, said he was ""optimistic"" and noted that the Palestinian group's response to the blueprint had included some comments but ""in general it is positive. ""He was speaking in Doha, Qatar, during a joint news conference with U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is on his fifth tour of the region since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered a nearly four-month-long Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip. The Hamas attack killed 1,200 people and took some 240 hostages back to Gaza, Israeli officials say. Israel's invasion of Gaza has killed more than 27,000 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Blinken, who had visited Saudi Arabia and Egypt earlier on his trip, said he would discuss the Hamas proposal with the Israeli leadership when he flew to Israel later in the day. Israeli officials said they were studying the proposal. Hamas released its own statement, saying it had received it in a ""positive spirit"" but still insisting on a permanent cease-fire and a withdrawal of Israeli military forces from the Gaza Strip, which Israel has so far rejected. Instead, Israel says it wants a temporary truce in return for the release of around 130 hostages still being held in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously said his forces would fight on until they achieved ""total victory"" over Hamas. Blinken admitted ""there's still a lot of work to be done"" but said in his talks in Saudi Arabia that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had said his country was ready to normalize ties with Israel if there is peace in Gaza. President Biden acknowledged Hamas' reaction to the proposal saying, ""There's some movement, there has been a response from . . . Hamas,"" according to The Associated Press. ""But it seems to be a little over the top. We're not sure where it is. There's continuing negotiations. ""Last week, a senior Hamas official told Reuters the proposal involved a three-stage cease-fire, with Hamas releasing the remaining civilian hostages in the first stage, then captured soldiers in the second and finally the bodies of dead hostages.",npr_articles/article_27.txt,npr_results/article_27.txt.json
28,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/06/1228097975/handala-naji-al-ali-cartoon-palestinian-symbol,"RAMALLAH, West Bank — His hair is like a hedgehog, his feet are bare, his clothes are rags and his back is to the world always. His name is Handala. A character created by Palestinian newspaper cartoonist Naji al-Ali in 1969 — two years after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war — the boy known as Handala is a symbol of the Palestinian struggle and resistance to occupation to this day. As the Israel-Hamas war rages on in Gaza, there has been renewed interest in Handala and what he represents. For instance, a group of artists in Italy recently banded together to create a poster that pays tribute to Handala. An Italian publishing house asked artists to send in their work — with one rule: All the figures had to be drawn with their backs to the reader, like Handala. With the 80 submissions it received, the publishing house created a poster that is available online and has been circulating widely on social media over the past few months. There is a monster, a mouse and a two-headed person, all with their backs to the reader. In solidarity, a group of artists in Japan created its own poster. Here's a history of who Handala and his creator are. Handala is forever 10 years old — the age that Ali was when his family was forced to move during the mass displacement of Palestinians in 1948 when the state of Israel was formed. Palestinians and their supporters refer to that displacement as the Nakba, or Arabic for ""catastrophe. ""Ali's refugee boy character shares his name with a resilient, bitter plant that grows in the Middle East called handal. It has deep roots and will always grow back even if it's weeded out. ""This character represents insurgency, refusal and struggle,"" says Egyptian columnist Nadi Hafez of al-Qabas newspaper, where Ali worked for a long time. ""And it satirizes the politics around the Palestinian cause, or the politics of the Arab world, or indeed international politics when it comes to the Palestinian cause. ""Handala didn't turn his back to the reader until 1973, after the Yom Kippur War, when a coalition of Arab countries led by Egypt and Syria fought Israel in October of that year. At the time, there was a push by countries including the U. S. for a settlement of the conflict. By turning Handala's back to the world, Ali was expressing his rejection of solutions from foreign nations imposed on Palestinians. ""The overpowering image is Handala silently watching things going on,"" says cartoonist and journalist Joe Sacco, author of the graphic novel Palestine. ""He is silent, but he is observing, and it is clear to the reader that he is knowing, he knows what's going on. He knows there is hypocrisy. ""During times of upheaval between Israel and Palestinians, Ali sometimes showed Handala engaged in activities that signify resistance, like throwing rocks, although there has been criticism of the way he depicted Israeli soldiers. ""The rights of resistance are understood, and when that is expressed through Handala, I think that is just a sign of incredible frustration about diplomacy, peace talks that generally lead nowhere,"" Sacco says. Born in 1938 in the Palestinian village of al-Shajara in Galilee in what is now northern Israel, Naji al-Ali drew more than 40,000 cartoons during his career and was equally critical of Israeli and Arab governments. Ali was a pan-Arab nationalist and was jailed many times for his anti-government activism. He spent much of his career in Kuwait, where he worked for al-Seyassah newspaper and then at al-Qabas newspaper. Ali was killed in 1987, shot by unknown assailants outside al-Qabas' office in London. London's Metropolitan Police reopened the case in 2017, but the murder remains unsolved. Handala's image is popular in street art and graffiti, especially on the Israeli-built barrier that separates Israel from the West Bank. ""Handala was the perfect embodiment of dispossession,"" Sacco says. ""Handala became the symbol for the poor and all those [ordinary] Arabs who were being shafted by their own elite, and by the West, and by Israel. ""Hafez, the Egyptian columnist who knew Ali, says that Handala remains important in this moment during the war. ""Handala is the character that the artist Naji al-Ali has made immortal in the human consciousness,"" he says.",npr_articles/article_28.txt,npr_results/article_28.txt.json

The last remaining Turkish bath, offering full body oil scrubs. The antiques shop with its trove of dusty treasures for sale. So many of Gaza City's gems are no more. They withstood decades of upheaval, preserving the memory of Gaza's ancient glory as a crossroads of civilizations. Now they have now been decimated in Israel's ongoing bombardment of Gaza, the deadliest war Palestinians have ever faced, prompted by the deadliest day Israelis have ever endured, when Hamas attacked Oct 7. ""It's really heartbreaking to see all this, and to think about the city that I cherish, that I'm from, that I love, in complete ruins,"" says Palestinian-American author Laila El-Haddad, fighting off tears. Her parents grew up in Gaza and she used to live there. ""I just can't imagine why — what the point is of destroying all these places. ""The destruction of Gaza's cultural heritage sites is among the crimes South Africa has alleged in its genocide case against Israel. We asked the Israeli military, the IDF, why it targeted these sites. It said some contained militants and tunnels. ""In response to Hamas' barbaric attacks, the IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities,"" it said. It blamed ""the malicious exploitation by Hamas of civilian buildings, including significant, mainly religious sites, for its own terrorist purposes. ""The Israeli military did not announce the targeting of these historical heritage sites. But Israeli media has reported the demolition of contemporary statues and monuments associated with Hamas. So much has been lost in Gaza, beyond the catastrophic death toll. More than half of Gaza's buildings are estimated to have been destroyed. But these landmarks showed another face of Gaza, different from the den of misery the world has come to know. For Palestinians, these sites were part of the tangle of threads linking their daily lives to their heritage stretching back thousands of years — an intangible connection to the past that cannot be replaced. We toured some of those sites ourselves in 2019, and created this mini travel guide to Gaza City, documenting the historical and cultural landmarks that tourists used to visit, before Hamas took control in 2007, and an Israeli blockade, supported by Egypt, sealed Gaza off from most outside visitors. After nearly four months of war, every site we visited then is now destroyed, badly damaged, or inaccessible. We could not survey this ourselves. Journalists cannot enter Gaza during the war. So NPR asked Omar El Qattaa, one of the few remaining photojournalists in Gaza City during these months of war, to document the destruction, so we could compare NPR's photos of what existed before this war began to what remains now. We shared the images with Ayman Hassouna, an historian of archaeology who had taken us on a tour of these sites in 2019. He fled his home in Gaza City when the current war began. ""I am shocked by the photos,"" says Hassouna. ""I cannot believe what has happened. It's like a nightmare. ""Few Gazans have been able to see what has happened to the sites since the war began. Most living in Gaza City escaped to the south in the early weeks of the war. As Israeli troops withdrew from parts of Gaza City in recent weeks, residents who did not flee the city ventured outside to make sense of their new, shattered landscapes. The Omari Mosque was the oldest mosque in Gaza, dating back to Crusader times. Destroyed by earthquakes and conquests, and rebuilt many times over history, the mosque had a storied history. It was originally a 5th century Byzantine church that was built over a more ancient temple. It was converted into a mosque in the 7th century, then a Crusader church in the 11th century, and back to a mosque in the 13th century. The architectural elements of the Crusader church were still apparent in the modern-day mosque, and an etching of a Jewish menorah on a mosque column, believed to have been originally part of an ancient synagogue, was once documented, and was destroyed in recent decades. Now Gaza's central mosque, with its blue-carpeted floors and stained glass windows, is unrecognizable. The Israeli military told NPR it struck the Omari Mosque to target militants and a tunnel shaft within the building. The Samaritan Hammam, a traditional domed bathhouse restored in the year 1320, was originally run by members of the ancient Samaritan religion. All that remains of the Samaritan Hammam are some archways nearly buried in the building's rubble, and the sign that used to be posted outside. Ahmad Elyassi, 38, stood next to the ruins of the bathhouse where he used to bathe with friends. Pinpricks of light used to stream through colorful holes in the domed ceiling. Bath attendants would give full body oil scrubs. ""I am honestly stunned,"" he says. ""I didn't expect they'd destroy it and level it. ""The Israeli military said it struck the Samaritan Hammam with ""precision munitions"" to target a Hamas squad and a network of tunnels inside. The military said it could not find information about the other landmarks on our list. The Pasha's Palace was built by a Mamluk sultan in the 13th century. A second story was added several hundred years ago during the Ottoman era. It is where Gaza historians say Napoleon spent three nights in February of 1799 during his military campaign in the region. In contemporary Gaza, it was a museum displaying Gaza's archaeological treasures, including centuries-old ceramic jars that had carried wine and olive oil from Gaza to ports across the Mediterranean — a reminder of a time of peace and economic prosperity for Gaza, and of its seafaring heritage. Now, Pasha's Palace is mostly rubble. Some outer walls and intricate archways remain standing. The current fate of the antiquities it displayed is unknown. The only item visible now is a destroyed car on a mound of dirt in front of the ruined palace. The Old Town Antique Store, a stall along a once-bustling marketplace, once brimmed with old photo albums, brass hamsa pendants meant to ward off the evil eye, and rare English books. Among the collection that once stuffed the shop: an original 1924 copy of ""Crime and Criminals in Palestine"" by a Jerusalem police inspector, and a 1930s telephone book featuring prominent Jewish and Palestinian families who were since scattered into exile and diaspora. Now the antique shop has been destroyed. Old film negatives are scattered among the debris. Saleem Elrayes, the cheery English-speaking owner who ran the shop for more than 30 years, could not be reached. Gaza's beachside fish restaurant, Al Salam Abu Haseira, is where we sat in 2019 at a long table, dining on grilled fish seasoned with hot pepper, parsley, onions, lemon and tomato. Its specialties were a touchstone of Gaza's seafaring tradition, including shrimp zibdiyeh, a spicy tomato stew, served in Gaza's traditional clay zibdiyeh cooking pots. The restaurant is now damaged, as seen through its wide windows facing the Mediterranean Sea. Beit Sitti, a chic cafe-restaurant nestled in a three-story traditional mansion, and an ode to Palestinian cultural heritage, is still standing, according to its previous owner, Gaza playwright and caricaturist Atef Salama. But it is locked and inaccessible, he says, and those who have keys have fled Gaza City and are unable to return. Set around an airy courtyard with caged birds and plants climbing the walls, the cafe served a traditional Palestinian breakfast spread of jams and mini flatbreads topped with cheese and za'atar spices. On Thursday evenings, it hosted a young clientele for dinner, water pipes and live Arabic music. Al-Mathaf, which means ""The Museum,"" is a 36-room room boutique hotel with sea views. It had a resplendent reception area with a patchwork of tiles and stones salvaged from old Gazan homes. The owner's private collection of Gazan antiquities had been displayed in the foyer. What happened to the hotel was unclear until early February, when Israeli troops had already withdrawn and it was safe for residents to approach the area. Our photographer found the hotel severely damaged. The reception hall was littered with shattered stones and tiles. Ancient jugs were smashed. Windows were broken, walls were pockmarked and roofs were demolished. The manicured garden of palm trees and cacti outside was ravaged. An exterior wall displayed Hebrew graffiti; one soldier had sprayed a message to his brother, a Hamas captive. The hotel appears to have been set on fire. We sent photos to Jawdat Khoudary, the hotel owner who left for Egypt. ""I am crying blood from a broken heart,"" he texted back. ""A house can be rebuilt, a son can be born, but when history is erased, it is difficult to restore. """,npr_articles/article_30.txt,npr_results/article_30.txt.json
31,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/04/1227892139/israel-eilat-tourism-israeli-evacuees-hamas-gaza-war,"EILAT, Israel — With the clear blue waters of the Gulf of Aqaba and stark peaks of the surrounding mountains, Eilat has long been a major driver of Israel's tourism economy. The thriving tourist trade in this town on the far southern tip of the country evaporated in October after Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people, according to the Israeli government. Vacationers fled and many airlines canceled or suspended flights to Israel, although some international carriers are resuming flights to the country. While much of Gaza is in ruins and the West Bank economy has been battered, Israel has also taken an economic hit from its war against Hamas, especially in its travel industry. Soon after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, the Israeli government evacuated many residents living near the borders of Gaza and Lebanon. Some 60,000 Israeli evacuees went to Eilat, doubling the city's population, according to a statement from the Eilat municipality. Instead of tourists, the area's hotels are now filled with Israelis displaced by war. Their housing, food and children's education is largely underwritten by the Israeli government. Michal Rahav is one of those displaced and taking refuge in Eilat. She comes from Kibbutz Nirim, a tiny community in southern Israel about a mile east of the Gaza border. Five people in Nirim were killed, and another five taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7, according to residents. Rahav says militants stormed her family's house. Her husband shot one dead, then handed her an M16 rifle. ""He gave me the gun and we were looking at each other and we said, 'We're fighting to the last bullet that we have,' "" she says. She and her husband tattooed the date of the attack and the words ""Until the last bullet"" in Hebrew on their forearms. Rahav's house was destroyed but the family survived. They arrived in Eilat with nothing. Like many others, they relied on donations from people in the city. Rahav, a demand and supply planner for a large food company, says Eilat was like a cocoon which helped them deal with the emotional aftermath of the Hamas attack. ""You know, Eilat, I very much love the city, but it's remote from everything,"" she says. ""And a lot of us . . . work two, three hours from here. ""While evacuees like Rahav adjusted to their temporary homes, business owners in Eilat adjusted to a new reality: no tourists mean no business. The once-busy tree-lined boulevards and beaches are deserted, and restaurants and shops are empty. For three decades, Shmulik Zino has been showing mostly European tourists the sights around Eilat from aboard his 30-foot wood-trimmed tourist boat. ""We're doing cruises with lunch and then also for diving,"" he says. ""Normally we cruise around the border Jordan, Egypt, Dolphin Reef. ""Nowadays, Zino spends his days doing maintenance on his boat and tending to his dockside flowerbed bursting with color. He says he's taking a real financial hit because there have been no tourists since October, and he isn't sure things will change anytime soon. ""We don't know what's going to be in the future,"" he says. ""We don't see the end of this war. ""Not far away, Samy Azulay gazes wearily out at a few children playing in the Gulf of Aqaba and shakes his head. He owns Eilat Water Sports, which rents out paddleboards and the like. He's had to lay off 15 people because business is so bad. Azulay says many of the evacuees don't have money for water sports, and adds that tourists don't want to come to a depressing place for vacation. ""The problem is . . . they don't like to stay because the atmosphere is not good. People are suffering. People are in a bad situation,"" he says. ""Who wants to come to make a holiday when there are only people who are very sad here?""The Israeli government last month announced an aid package for Eilat, including 50 million shekels (about $13 million) to the municipality to help businesses, Israeli business news site The Marker reported. Itamar Elitzur, CEO of Eilat Hotel Association, says he wants part of the funds to be used for advertising to let Israelis know there are bargains on flights and hotel rooms. ""The prices now in Eilat are the lowest there ever was,"" he says, like going back to the 1990s. Elitzur says the advertising campaign will encourage Israelis to just come ""take the air"" — in other words, relax, breathe deeply. He says they need to avoid the word ""vacation"" because Israelis don't want to feel guilty about enjoying themselves during the war in Gaza. Most Israelis know someone in the war, whether it's a neighbor, friend or relative, he says. ""And I can't say to them, 'I'm going to vacation. '""Elitzur says more rooms are coming available as displaced Israelis in Eilat go home or find new places to live. About half of those who arrived in October have moved new temporary homes. The Finance Ministry and Eilat municipality confirmed the subsidies and other support for Israeli evacuees but would not provide further comment for this story. Last month, Israeli Tourism Minister Haim Katz said tourist numbers had been soaring until the Oct. 7 attack, and he's hopeful the industry will bounce back to help jump-start the postwar economy, according to The Jerusalem Post. But the war is rounding the four-month mark and it's unclear how long it will last. Rahav says all those from her little kibbutz will soon be moving to the city of Beer Sheva, which is closer to home than Eilat. ""We have to our community to preserve,"" she says. ""We have to continue moving. ""Anat Marla, also from Kibbutz Nirim, will go with the rest of her community to Beer Sheva. She's looking forward to leaving the hotel in Eilat. ""I'm just waiting, you know, to be able — I can't believe I'm saying it — but cook, clean, wash the dishes,"" she says with a laugh. But Marla says many other displaced Israelis in Eilat aren't ready to leave, especially those from northern Israel, where there are nearly daily skirmishes between Israel's military and Hezbollah militants along the border with Lebanon. ""A lot of the people are just saying . . . 'We have no plan on going back until we're just like, security is restored and . . . the goals of the fighting have been accomplished,' "" Marla says. That means thousands of displaced Israelis could remain in Eilat for a long time. Eve Guterman contributed reporting in Eilat, Israel.",npr_articles/article_31.txt,npr_results/article_31.txt.json
32,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/03/1228857108/us-strikes-iran-proxies-houthis-yemen,"The U. S. struck Iranian-linked targets in the Middle East for a second consecutive day Saturday. The U. S. and allies hit 36 Houthi targets at 13 locations in Yemen, the Pentagon said Saturday. On Friday, the U. S. struck facilities in Iraq and Syria, as part of a broader campaign that U. S officials say is in retaliation for a drone attack that killed three American soldiers. The U. S. says it struck Iran-backed proxies in each country. The Pentagon said the U. K. , Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and New Zealand were involved in Saturday's strikes against Houthi targets, saying they were in response to Houthi attacks targeting international shipping vessels. U. S. Central Command said strikes targeted ""multiple underground storage facilities, command and control, missile systems, UAV storage and operations sites, radars, and helicopters"" used by the Houthis. The current round of U. S. strikes is more extensive and deadly than those from the previous few months. U. S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said the Houthis will ""continue to bear further consequences if they do not end their illegal attacks on international shipping and naval vessels. ""The attacks come in response to a drone attack on a U. S. support base in Jordan on Jan. 28 that killed three Army Reserve soldiers. An Iranian-backed militia group claimed responsibility for the attack. It was the highest death toll of U. S. troops in the Middle East in at least a decade. Iran's foreign ministry called the attacks a ""strategic mistake"" and said they ""will have no other result other than intensifying tensions and instability in the region. ""Iranian-backed militias have mounted more than 165 drone, missile and rocket attacks on U. S. troops in Iraq and Syria since the Israel-Hamas war began in October. U. S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan would not rule out strikes within Iran when asked about that possibility Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press. ""Well, sitting here today on a national news program, I'm not going to get into what we've ruled in and ruled out from the point of view of military action,"" Sullivan said. ""What I will say is that the president is determined to respond forcefully to attacks on our people. The president also is not looking for a wider war in the Middle East. ""Sullivan did say that strikes against the militias will continue. ""It began with strikes on Friday night but that is not the end of it,"" he told NBC. ""We intend to take additional strikes and additional action to continue to send a clear message that that the United States will respond when our forces are attacked, or people are killed. "" The latest strikes came on the same day that U. S. military officials say U. S. forces destroyed six Houthi anti-ship cruise missiles in Yemen in ""self-defense,"" saying that the missiles were to be used against ships in the Red Sea.  U. S. and British forces have carried out multiple attacks against Houthi military facilities, as the Iranian-backed group has continued to target commercial shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.",npr_articles/article_32.txt,npr_results/article_32.txt.json
33,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/03/1228857501/iraq-condemns-us-airstrikes-retaliation,"BAGHDAD – Iraqi government officials on Saturday condemned U. S. airstrikes on Iran-linked targets in Iraq, saying the attacks showed that U. S. forces had become a threat to their host country — a sentiment that will likely hasten demands for the U. S. -led military coalition in Iraq to leave. Militia officials named 16 fighters they said were killed in the strikes late Friday, including five medics they said died when an airstrike hit a base hospital in western al-Anbar province. The Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) — made up of armed groups that are now part of Iraqi government security forces — said seven of the 16 fatalities were  killed when the U. S. bombed its al-Anbar province operations headquarters. It said at least 36 more people were injured and searches were ongoing for missing fighters. The mayor of al-Qaim, a city close to the border with Syria where some of the targets were located, told NPR by phone that at least one civilian was also killed in the strikes and at least five homes near the operations headquarters were destroyed. ""We had information that the area would be bombed a day or two before,"" said the mayor, Turki Muhammad Khalaf. He said many of the residents near the base had evacuated their homes as a precaution. The U. S. said it launched the attacks as retaliation for the killing of three U. S. soldiers in a drone attack last Sunday on a remote base in Jordan, also close to borders with Syria and Iraq. The U. S. blamed the strike on the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of militias, and said it believed the attack bore the fingerprints of Kataib Hezbollah, the most powerful militia in the group. Kataib Hezbollah said after the attack in Jordan that it was suspending strikes on U. S. targets to avoid ""embarrassing"" the Iraqi government, which has come under intense U. S. pressure to try to halt the attacks. By Saturday evening, the militia had not commented on the Friday night attacks. Another militia group, Harakat al-Nujaba, told the Associated Press that the U. S. must understand that ""every action elicits a reaction"" but that the group did not want to escalate regional tensions. A spokesman for the group told the AP the targeted bases were mostly empty at the time of the U. S. attacks. The Iraqi government spokesman condemned the strikes targeting the Popular Mobilization Forces as ""blatant aggression"" and a violation of Iraqi sovereignty. The PMF was formed from dozens of militias which answered a call by Iraq's most senior Shiite cleric to fight the Sunni militant group ISIS in 2014 after Iraqi army divisions collapsed in the face of the ISIS onslaught. The Iraqi government declared three days of mourning for the dead. ""This aggressive airstrike will push the security situation in Iraq and the region to the brink of the abyss,"" said Basim Alawadi, the government spokesman. ""We assert that the presence of the international coalition, which deviated from its assigned tasks and granted mandate, has become a reason for endangering security and stability in Iraq. It also serves as a justification for entangling Iraq in regional and international conflicts. "" Alawadi said U. S. claims that it had informed the Iraqi government of the strikes beforehand were not true, calling it ""intentional deception. ""Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and senior Iraqi military leaders have told Western diplomats they believe the U. S. -led coalition and the intelligence, surveillance and technological assets it provides are still needed in Iraq, but it appears to have become politically untenable for those forces to stay in Iraq. Sudani last week convened a meeting of Iraqi and U. S. military officials for what he described as the start of a timetable for a departure of U. S. -led forces. The U. S. maintains about 2,500 service members in Iraq and another 900 in neighboring Syria. Although their  mission is helping Iraq and Syrian Kurds fight ISIS, the U. S. government's focus on isolating Iran has sparked concern in Iraq and Iran that that is now the major preoccupation of the U. S. military presence here. The militias are in part a legacy of the security vacuum after the U. S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, when U. S. occupation authorities disbanded Iraq's armed forces. Al-Qaida sprung up in that vacuum, launching waves of bombing attacks on both U. S targets and undefended Shia shrines and neighborhoods, prompting the rise of Shiite militias to counter both them and the U. S. forces. Iraq quickly spiraled into a civil war. Dozens of militias formed when ISIS – a successor to al-Qaida in Iraq – burst onto the scene in 2014. Many of those militias were incorporated into Iraq's official security forces and put on the Iraqi government payroll with the defeat of ISIS in Syria five years later. Although they are nominally under the command of the Iraqi prime minister, many of the major groups have stronger links to Iran. Some of the Iran-linked militias based in Iraq are part of The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose group that escalated attacks against U. S. military targets from Iraq and Syria after the start of the Gaza war. Militia leaders have said they will stop attacks against the U. S. when the war in Gaza, in which the U. S. supplies weapons to Israel, stops.  Awadh al-Taie contributed reporting from Baghdad.",npr_articles/article_33.txt,npr_results/article_33.txt.json
34,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/02/1228132782/us-biden-iran-drone-response-strike,"The U. S. military has mounted a series of air and missile strikes against Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria, NPR has confirmed, in retaliation for a suicide drone strike that killed three American soldiers on Sunday at a remote base in Jordan. The airstrikes, which used more than 125 precision munitions, came at 4 p. m. ET Friday and struck more than 85 targets, U. S. Central Command said in a statement. ""The facilities that were struck included command and control operations, centers, intelligence centers, rockets, and missiles, and unmanned aired vehicle storages, and logistics and munition supply chain facilities of militia groups and their IRGC sponsors who facilitated attacks against U. S. and Coalition forces,"" CENTCOM said, referring to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, told reporters Friday that in all seven facilities used by IRGC and its proxies were hit — three in Iraq and four in Syria. The strikes, he said, occurred over 30 minutes. The Iraqi government was informed beforehand, he said. The targets were chosen to avoid civilian casualties, he said. The U. S. strikes are far more extensive and deadly than those that have been launched since last October, when the Israeli-Gaza war began and pro-Iranian groups like the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq started an uptick of attacks. That's because the Jan. 28 attacks on a U. S. support base in Jordan was the highest death toll of troops in the Middle East in at least a decade. Three Army Reserve soldiers from Georgia were killed when an attack drone slammed into their sleeping quarters. Another three dozen were wounded, a handful seriously. President Biden traveled Friday to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, where the bodies of the three soldiers returned in flag-draped silver cases. In a statement after the strikes, Biden said: ""Our response began today.  It will continue at times and places of our choosing. The United States does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world.  But let all those who might seek to do us harm know this: If you harm an American, we will respond. "" The U. S. attacks were telegraphed for days. Biden told reporters outside the White House earlier this week he had decided on a response. And lawmakers were told by senior administration officials that the president wanted military options ""a level or two up"" from the ""whack-a-mole strikes we had been doing on (militia) storage and launch sites. ""National Security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that the initial American strikes were likely just the beginning. ""It's very possible you will see a tiered approach here,"" Kirby said, ""not just a single action, but potentially multiple actions over a period of  time. ""Republican lawmakers have pressed Biden to strike Iran itself because it has trained and supported the militia groups that have targeted American troops, while Democrats — and Biden himself — have been more reluctant about targeting Iran and widening the Israeli-Gaza war into a regional conflict. Retired Adm. James Stavridis wrote in Bloomberg that the deaths of the three American soldiers required Biden to respond with a ""new level of force. "" That should include ""continuous strikes against proxy targets in Syria and Yemen,""  while working with Iraq ""to expand strikes to their country. ""Stavridis also said the U. S. should be ""prepping for a significant cyber attack"" on Iran, including severing its ties to its proxy forces, penetrating its oil and gas infrastructure and reducing its armament production. Brad Bowman, a Middle East analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said it was essential for the U. S. to ""hit back hard to restore tattered American deterrence. "" But he worried whether the U. S. troops in the region had enough defenses to ""prepare for the inevitable counterpunch that will come after U. S. airstrikes. "" Pentagon officials have been reluctant to talk openly about the possibility of any increased American defenses in the region. Charles Lister, an analyst at the Middle East Institute, said it appeared the Biden administration was moving from strikes to deter Iranian-backed militias and Iranian units themselves to efforts that would degrade their power. It all seems like a ""campaign,"" he said, rather than a ""single round of strikes. ""Lister said that beyond the Iranian-backed militias, there are ""plenty of target options"" including bases in Syria where the Iranian Revolutionary Guard is located to Iranian naval assets, such as the MV Behshad, an Iranian cargo ship suspected of being a spy platform helping Houthi militants target shipping in the Red Sea. ""But that'd feed into the 'regional war' language that the Biden administration remains keen to avoid,"" Lister said. The Iranian-backed militias have mounted more than 165 drone, missile and rocket attacks on U. S. troops in Iraq and Syria since last fall. Most led to minor injuries, though one service member took some shrapnel to the head and was sent back to the U. S. for further treatment. The U. S. has repeatedly hit targets in Syria and Iraq, though the militias continue to strike at American targets — part of Iran's strategy of pushing the U. S. out of the region. Last October, the U. S. responded with airstrikes by bombing weapons and storage facilities in Syria with F-16 jets. A few weeks later, the U. S. hit more targets in Syria, including those used by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and its allies. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, nine workers in the facilities were killed in the strikes. On Nov. 21, 2023, U. S. Air Force AC-130 gunship retaliated against the Iranian-backed militia Kataib Hezbollah, striking a vehicle near Abu Ghraib, Iraq, in response to an attack the day before. U. S. forces at al Asad Airbase west of Baghdad. According to U. S. assessments, several Iran-backed fighters were killed in the strike. The next day, U. S. fighter jets conducted airstrikes on Iraqi Kataib Hezbollah facilities, killing over eight fighters. And there were two strikes in December by the U. S. in Iraq, hitting militants near Kirkuk, and killing five as they attempted to fire on U. S. forces. Another one hit a militia base in Hillah, killing one militant and wounding 20 others. The so-called ""axis of resistance"" is a network of Iran proxy groups across the region. It includes Hezbollah in Lebanon, a coalition of militias in Iraq that go by the name the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, Ansar Allah — Houthi forces — in Yemen and Iran-linked groups in eastern Syria. Kataib Hezbollah (which means Party of God Brigades) is not a subsidiary of the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon, but both have close links to Iran. KH is considered the most powerful of the Iran-backed militias in the Iraq-based resistance, which has claimed about 160 attacks on U. S. forces since the beginning of the Gaza war. It was one of the many Shiite militias that fought ISIS starting in 2014 and along with others, was incorporated into Iraq's official security forces in 2019. Before the Gaza war, the group was known for attacks on the U. S. military which it considers to be occupying forces in Iraq, including using roadside bombs manufactured in Iran. The U. S. killed the founder of KH, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, in the same drone strike four years ago in Baghdad that killed Iranian general Quassem Soleimani. Muhandis was also a senior Iraqi government security official and that killing dramatically raised tension in Iraq with U. S. forces. On Jan. 24, the U. S. struck three bases of Kataib Hezbollah in retaliation for strikes that included an attack on the Ain al-Asad base in Western al-Anbar. U. S. officials have said that the attack on a remote U. S. base in Jordan that killed three service members last week had the fingerprints of KH. Iran does not exert complete command over the proxies and most, like Lebanon's Hezbollah, have their own domestic agendas. U. S. troops left Iraq in 2011 but returned in 2014 to fight ISIS alongside Iraqi forces. And now there are 2,550 — not in combat, but assisting Iraqis in going after the remnants of ISIS. Now, many of the U. S. troops are stationed in northern Iraq in Erbil, and those troops also support the anti-ISIS fight next door in Syria. The U. S. also provides hundreds of millions of dollars to Iraq in aid, government development, humanitarian assistance, demining efforts and military sales --more than $16 billion, covering everything from F-16 aircraft to helicopters and radar and small arms. In addition, the U. S. has provided Iraq with excess defense equipment over the recent years — 300 large armored vehicles, Humvees, helicopters, body armor — all of which contributed to the ISIS fight. Still, the U. S. airstrikes have created a political problem for the Iraqi government, some of whose parliamentarians have ties to Iran and want to see U. S. forces withdraw from the country. And the latest strikes will certainly add to that headache. Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani came to power because Iran, and the militias it supports, backed him. So in between anger over the U. S. role in supplying Israel with weapons for the war in Gaza, and anger over U. S. breaches of Iraqi sovereignty, he faces intense pressure about the future of U. S. forces in Iraq. Now the U. S. and Iraq are talking about an ""evolving"" mission for U. S. troops, and there seems to be a disconnect. An adviser to the Iraqi prime minister said the aim is to come up with what he called a specific and clear timetable for the gradual reduction of the U. S. -led coalition troops in Iraq and to an end to the U. S. -led anti-ISIS mission. The government spokesman, Bassem al-Awadi, told Iraqi state TV viewers that Sudani had repeatedly made clear that Iraq's stability required ending the U. S. military presence in Iraq. ""He literally said that ending the mission of the international coalition in Iraq is necessary for Iraq,"" said al-Awadi. ""He used the term necessity. And I assure you that when the prime minister uses a term, he means it. ""That's not how the U. S. sees it. In a background call recently senior Pentagon and State Department officials said the talks are not about a withdrawal of U. S. troops. They said it's about shaping the future of the U. S. military presence. That presence will be determined, they say, by the strength of ISIS and the capability of Iraqi forces.",npr_articles/article_34.txt,npr_results/article_34.txt.json

William Jerome Rivers, 46, of Carrollton, Ga. ; Sgt. Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23, of Savannah, Ga. ; and Sgt. Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, of Waycross, Ga. were carefully carried off a gray C-5 transport plane. They were all Army reservists, killed last weekend in a drone attack on a military outpost in Jordan near the Syrian border. President Biden stood with his hand over his heart, an expression of deep pain on his face, looking straight ahead as the flag-draped cases were brought past him. First lady Jill Biden, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Charles Q. Brown stood nearby. It is one of the most solemn tasks for a commander-in-chief, bearing witness as the bodies of fallen service members return to U. S. soil at Dover Air Force Base. It is known as a dignified transfer and it is freighted with emotion as family members of the fallen watch as the cases are carried from the plane. The family members had met with the Bidens before the dignified transfer began, and watched the solemn movement from a small section of white folding chairs set up on the tarmac out of view from the members of the media who travel with the president. The U. S. government is still investigating how Iranian-backed militants were able to successfully attack the outpost. Biden told reporters earlier this week that he has already authorized a response. The White House has said that the response would include a series of actions and would roll out over time. On Thursday, Biden said he was praying for the families of the three service members who were killed. ""I spoke with each of these families separately,"" Biden said at the national prayer breakfast. ""They risked it all and we'll never forget the sacrifices and service to our country. And the dozens of service members who were wounded and are recovering now.

Some of the families criticized him afterward, blaming his policies for the loss of their loved ones. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution captured video of Biden's call with Shawn Sanders and Oneida Oliver-Sanders, the parents of Sgt. Kennedy Landon Sanders. During the call, Biden offered his condolences, offered the support of the nation and shared his own experience of loss. He also asked their permission to be there with them for the dignified transfer. When Biden told them that Sanders had been posthumously promoted to sergeant, Oliver-Sanders broke down.

The minister, Yoav Gallant, was accompanied by several generals on Thursday in Khan Younis, a Hamas stronghold and the main battleground in recent weeks. The appearance by Gallant and the senior officers lent credence to the claim that Israel's military had effectively dismantled the Hamas forces defending the city. ""The operation in the Khan Yunis area is progressing and yielding impressive results,"" Gallant said. ""We will also reach Rafah and eliminate terror elements that threaten us. ""Rafah is about 7 miles farther south from Khan Younis, on Gaza's border with Egypt. Rafah is the last sizable town that's still in Palestinian hands. Most of Gaza's 2. 2 million civilians have fled their homes throughout the territory and are now crammed into the southern part of Gaza, with many camped out in tents in the Rafah area. They are enduring a humanitarian crisis, made even harsher this week by cold, wet, windy weather. Much of the international aid entering Gaza comes through Rafah's border crossing with Egypt. Egypt has long opposed letting the Palestinians enter its territory for a couple of reasons. Egypt fears Gaza's chronic turmoil could spill over into its country. It is also concerned that if Palestinians flee Gaza, they may not be allowed to return. The latest Israeli military advances raise questions about how much fighting strength Hamas has left. While Hamas is still battling back, Israel says the group is no longer operating with cohesive units and is limited to small-scale, guerrilla-style attacks. However, Naji Malaeb, a retired general in Lebanon who's now a military analyst, believes Hamas is adjusting to the large Israeli military presence in Gaza and will be able to keep fighting. ""Hamas is a militia. Militias fight according to field necessities,"" he said. Hamas, he added, ""does not need big groups of fighters everywhere. Adapting new strategies is not a sign of weakness. ""He believes the vast Hamas tunnel network will help the group survive and continue to fight. Gallant gave an updated estimate on Hamas casualties, saying about 10,000 Hamas fighters have been killed, with a similar number injured. NPR and other news organizations have not been able to independently verify the Israeli estimates, and Hamas refuses to provide casualty figures. When the fighting began, military analysts estimated that Hamas fighters numbered anywhere from 20,000 to 40,000. In addition, Hamas rocket fire into Israel has dropped off dramatically. Since the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, the group has launched more than 14,000 rockets at Israel, according to the Israeli government. But the vast majority were in the early days of the war, when Tel Aviv and other cities in central and southern Israel faced a constant threat of attack. Hamas fired about a dozen rockets at Tel Aviv on Monday, and Israel's Iron Dome defense system shot them down as they approached the city. The rocket volley was noteworthy mostly because it was the first attack on the city in weeks. It's not clear whether Hamas is running out of the rockets, or whether it's just too difficult for the militants to launch them with Israeli forces all over Gaza. Whatever the reason, this threat has diminished considerably. Meanwhile, Israel and Hamas are both reviewing a cease-fire proposal that would also include Hamas releasing some Israeli hostages and Israel freeing some Palestinian prisoners. The Israeli government said Hamas is holding 132 Israelis who were seized on Oct. 7. Of that number, Israel believes 103 are still alive and 29 are dead. The latest round of negotiations, like earlier rounds, is proving to be a drawn-out process, particularly for Hamas. The group has leaders in exile, while those in Gaza are widely believed to be operating in the group's tunnel network, making communications difficult. For Israel, the working premise is that the top Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, is underground somewhere near his hometown of Khan Younis. This hasn't been independently verified, but raises the possibility that Sinwar and other Hamas leaders are weighing the cease-fire plan beneath the city, while the advancing Israeli troops are just above ground. The Hamas leadership is seeking a permanent cease-fire and the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza. Under such a scenario, Hamas would try to portray this as a win, said Yohanan Tzoreff, a former Israeli military officer who's now at Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies. ""When we're talking about organizations like Hamas, the idea is how to prevent victory by the other side,"" said Tzoreff. ""It doesn't matter if you've lost 20,000 or 30,000 or 100,000 people. The most important issue is to stay in your territory, not to be crushed. ""He believes Hamas will claim victory as long as its leadership can remain in Gaza and say it survived a war with Israel, the strongest military in the Middle East. However, it's not clear who will be running Gaza in the future. Israel's military is likely to stay for a while, though Israel insists it does not want to remain for long. Israel also says it will not allow Hamas to return to power in Gaza, and it also opposes the Palestinian Authority, which handles Palestinian affairs in the West Bank. In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his goal remains the total destruction of Hamas. Yet many analysts draw a distinction between Israel taking military control of Gaza — which appears very plausible — and completely eliminating Hamas, both militarily and politically. Any such attempt is likely to take many months and wouldn't come with any guarantees on the outcome.",npr_articles/article_36.txt,npr_results/article_36.txt.json
37,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2024/02/02/1228089758/israel-gaza-war-palestinian-neurosurgeon,"As a boy, Husam Abukhedeir had a dream. ""I would tell myself, 'Husam will not be anything except a doctor,'"" he recalls. He wanted to help the people of his beloved Gaza, where he spent his carefree childhood summers. His parents worked as teachers in Saudi Arabia during the year, and they all traveled to Gaza almost every summer. After he finished high school, his parents retired and the family went back to live in Gaza. Abukhedeir did indeed become a doctor — with a specialty in neurosurgery. He went on to head the neurosurgery department at Al-Shifa, the largest hospital in Gaza, and began training other doctors in the field. Then came the war: On Oct. 7, Hamas attacked Israel, killing some 1,200 Israelis and taking about 200 hostages. Israel's subsequent military campaign in Gaza has so far killed nearly 27,000 Palestinians and caused countless injuries, displaced millions and left extensive damage to infrastructure, including hospitals. Abukhedeir confronted cases unlike anything he'd seen before. On Nov. 14, he decided he and his family had to leave Gaza for their safety. Because he has a U. S. green card and his wife and their five children are U. S. citizens, they were able to enter Egypt after a week. He has since relocated with his family to the United Arab Emirates for a neurosurgery position. The 43-year-old is haunted by his experiences at Al-Shifa during the war. He worries that the war has cost his community greatly — not just lost lives and demolished buildings, but also human capital and talent that may be hard to make up for years to come. But he holds out hope that he can return to rebuild and help his community. Abukhedeir's path to becoming a doctor was full of challenges. When he finished high school in Gaza he came face-to-face with a realization: Being from Gaza hamstrings you in many ways. ""You always feel you're different. You're not like other people . . . just because you're from Gaza,"" he said. That was clear when he was applying to medical school. His retired parents didn't have the funds to finance an education abroad. The only medical school he could consider at the time was Al-Quds University in Jerusalem. He was accepted in 1999, but friends discouraged him — what if the need for permits from Israeli authorities to exit and reenter Gaza or possible conflict interrupted his medical education?He applied to study engineering in Gaza as a backup. But he kept hoping he'd find a way to pursue medicine, remembering how his parents always told him ""Gazans are destined to struggle. But tomorrow is going to be better. ""Then he landed a scholarship to study medicine in Sudan. Abukhedeir made the hard choice of not going back to Gaza to visit his family the entire six years of his studies out of fear that he might not be able to return to Sudan. ""My colleagues would travel back to their families every summer and I would just stay behind,"" he says. ""[Travel] is like a dream for people from Gaza. To plan for it, you need months. And it may not work out in the end. Other people just book a ticket and go. ""Once Abukhedeir graduated in 2005, he returned to Gaza as an intern at Al-Shifa Hospital, then got a job as a general practitioner at the neurosurgery department. ""And honestly, I started to really love the specialty. It's a very delicate specialty and I found myself in it,"" he says. The three-week war between Israel and Gaza in 2008-09 made Abukhedeir determined to pursue neurosurgery. During the fighting, severely injured patients flowed into Al-Shifa, including brain and spinal cases. Abukhedeir realized he didn't have the skills to treat some of the most complex cases. That's when he decided he needed to enroll in a neurosurgery residency program — training that can take as long as seven years. But there were no such specialized programs in Gaza. Abukhedeir's choice was to leave again. It took years to make it happen. Paperwork delays — the kind that many Gazans are used to — saw precious opportunities come and go. In 2011, he secured a scholarship to a six-year program in Jordan and gained additional expertise in the U. S. , Asia and Europe through short-term courses and conferences. In 2021, he finally came home as a credentialed neurosurgeon. ""I knew that it is Gaza forever,"" he says. ""I wanted to go back to serve my people and fulfill a mission. "" Part of that mission was helping to grow a neurosurgery department and a residency training program — the kind of infrastructure he dreamed of having at home when he was younger. ""We built a good neurosurgery department,"" he says. ""We had seven residents at Al-Shifa and seven residents at the European hospital [another hospital in Gaza they partnered with]. We really cared about teaching residents the way we learnt abroad. ""Years ago, we really needed a program like that, and finally we were able to build it for the trainees. Thank God. I swear it was like a dream,"" he says. Abukhedeir and his family could have left Gaza when the war began in October. But they chose to stay. ""I couldn't leave my patients,"" he said. ""But also, as the head of the department, I couldn't just leave my younger colleagues and trainees. They needed a leader. ""He considered sending his family to safety, but his wife and kids all believed in his mission and didn't want to leave. He says his 7-year-old son cried and said he didn't want his dad to be alone in Gaza. So they stayed, camping out in his small office at Al-Shifa Hospital for a month after he and his wife decided Israeli airstrikes meant their home was not safe. His 13-year-old daughter, Hanin, says it was such a hard time. ""There were terrifying sounds,"" she remembers. ""And we all slept together in a small room. There were no beds or covers for sleeping. ""Abukhedeir had to operate in grueling shifts to try to keep up with the continuous flow of patients. He was devastated by what he saw: children as young as 2 with concrete or wooden shards piercing their faces. ""Skulls are completely crushed sometimes, bleeding, brains oozing out, shrapnel filling the brain,"" he says. Many patients came in with no IDs or surviving family members. The doctors had to give each a numerical tag, writing on their skins ""anonymous patient 1,"" ""anonymous patient 2"" and so on. He said patients would come to Al-Shifa in waves of a hundred or so after airstrikes leveled residential buildings. Abukhedeir and his team saved some patients but had to face a bitter reality: They did not have the resources to treat everyone. ""These are my people, my community"" he says. ""My goal as a physician is to heal them — not to decide who I'm going to treat and who I'll leave. ""Abukhedeir recalls a young man in his 20s who was injured in an Israeli airstrike and paralyzed due to suspected bleeding in his spine. He needed an MRI scan before Abukhedeir could perform surgery, but Israel's blockade of Gaza meant that the hospital's dwindling supply of electricity and fuel wasn't capable of powering the machine. ""You look at this young man, and his family is around you screaming, 'He will be paralyzed. ' It's one of the hardest situations to be in,"" he says. ""As a surgeon you see people you can't serve, even though you have the expertise to do the surgery. ""In late October, an Israeli airstrike killed the stepson of his 40-year-old sister Dalia; she was badly injured. She came to the hospital with more than 60% of her body covered in second- and third-degree burns. ""I actually couldn't recognize her from how burnt she was,"" he says. Dalia died shortly after. Abukhedeir had no time to mourn. Israeli forces were encircling Al-Shifa Hospital, cutting supplies to the medical complex as they were looking for what they believed to be a Hamas command center underneath. (On the edge of the hospital compound, they found a tunnel shaft leading to several underground rooms, part of the larger tunnel network in Gaza. The Israelis also said they found weapons in the hospital. But the evidence presented by the Israelis did not show evidence of a command center. )During that phase of the war, says Abukhedeier, ""most of the patients who were in the ICU, they died because there were no resources. ""We stopped offering surgeries because resources at the OR were depleted. ""Abukhedeir felt he had been stripped of his power as a physician. He'd become a mere witness to the death and suffering of his people. He feared for the lives of his wife and kids — and his own life. That's when he decided to leave. From his new home in the United Arab Emirates, Abukhedeir keeps in constant contact with his young neurosurgery trainees who are still in Gaza serving other hospitals. Their situation breaks his heart. He says it feels like everything he dreamed of, worked for and was able to accomplish was demolished. ""The end of the war is unclear. And even when the war is over, everything is gone. My house is gone,"" he says. Gaza has also lost Abukhedeir's expertise — for the near future and potentially for years to come. He is one of many health care workers who left Gaza fearing for their lives. That's on top of hundreds who were killed since the war started and others who were injured, arrested and detained, including the director-general of Al-Shifa Hospital, who was arrested on Nov. 23, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Abukhedeir says that even though he and his family are now safe, he is full of dread: His elderly parents are still in Gaza. He lost connection with them multiple times for weeks at a time. ""Their living conditions are horrid,"" he says. ""God be with them. ""He worries constantly that he will get a phone call about yet another family member or friend killed in Gaza. But when he talks to his children, he tries to strike the same cheery note his parents struck when they encouraged him as a child. ""God willing, this hardship will pass,"" he softly tells them. ""We will be back to rebuild our house that was destroyed. And will repeat all the happy memories we lived together there.

38,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/01/1228388748/biden-executive-order-israeli-settlers-west-bank-palestinians,"President Biden issued an executive order on Thursday targeting Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have been attacking Palestinians in the occupied territory. The order named four people and will lay the groundwork for financial sanctions against settlers who carry out violent assaults, which have increased since Hamas launched an attack on Israel three months ago, triggering a full-scale war in Gaza. The order will not target U. S. citizens, who make up a significant number of the settler community. The Biden administration had issued an order late last year imposing travel bans on Israeli settlers who had attacked Palestinians. While only four people are named, the order marks the first time that the U. S. has targeted Israeli settlers with the threat of frozen assets and bank accounts in an attempt to rein in settler attacks on Palestinians living in the West Bank, which Palestinians see as the central plank of a future Palestinian state. ""This violence poses a grave threat to peace, security, and stability in the West Bank, Israel, and the Middle East region, and threatens the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,"" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement. There have been almost 500 attacks by settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank, which is largely under Israeli-military occupation, since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, according to the United Nations. Some Palestinians have been killed in these attacks while settlers have also attacked property and torched cars, the Palestinian authorities and human right groups say. Three of the four men named in Thursday's executive order have been prosecuted by Israeli authorities, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters on Thursday. One of the four men cited in the order, Shalom Zicherman, was indicted by Israeli police on assault and damage charges in 2022, after he was filmed attacking left-wing Israeli activists near Hebron, in the southern West Bank, as they traveled to join a demonstration in protest at Palestinians being evicted from their homes, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the announcement on Thursday, saying, ""Israel acts against all those who break the law everywhere, and therefore there is no room for exceptional measures in this regard. ""But Dror Etkes, an Israeli expert in settler violence, welcomed the news. ""The fact that these people are walking free and they are in the West Bank and can do what they want to do is an indication that the law enforcement system in Israel. . . prefers not to deal with this type of people,"" he told NPR. ""This is why we came to the point that the American administration is, you know, is sanctioning them,"" he said, adding that all four had been ""involved in severe violent attacks against Palestinians. ""Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who himself lives in a settlement in the West Bank, said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that ""the 'settler violence campaign is an anti-Semitic lie spread by Israel's enemies with the aim of discrediting the pioneer settlers.

Most of the population has been displaced by Israel's intensifying military campaign – with the United Nations saying nowhere is safe in Gaza as Israeli airstrikes have hit every part of the besieged strip. Israeli bombardment has even destroyed Gaza zoos, killing many of the animals there. The animals that survived are starving alongside their human caretakers. The United Nations reports that 90% of the population of Gaza regularly goes a whole day without food. Other basic necessities like clean water, fuel, medicine and medical supplies are all scarce. In the face of all this, some zookeepers in Gaza say animals are dying of starvation.   In retaliation for Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that killed 1,200 people, according to Israel, entire neighborhoods have been leveled and the war has killed more than 27,000 people, according to Palestinian health officials.  Veterinarian Dr. Amir Khalil of Four Paws, an organization dedicated to saving animals from war zones, is trying to coordinate a rescue mission from some of Gaza's remaining zoos. He rescued and treated animals during previous conflicts in Gaza and knows the dire conditions the animals were living in even before the war. He contacted the various parties involved, including the Israeli army, Palestine Authority, and locals in Gaza, to try and facilitate.    As the war in Gaza escalates, hopes for his mission dwindle. While seemingly secondary in the shadow of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Khalil spoke with Morning Edition about the importance of saving any innocent life from the horrors of war. ""I think it is the wrong time to say whom to save and whom not to save,"" said Khalil ""Everyone has his function to do. I think if I'm able to help one creature, it's enough for me. "" The situation in Gaza presents a unique set of challenges and dangers. Khalil describes the need for ""intelligence work"" before even embarking on the rescue. ""We are prepared for the unexpected . . . but the most important thing is the safety and the security for the team,"" said . Khalil. ""So we cannot enter without coordination with all involved stakeholders. . . So it's like a military operation, in fact. "" Drawing from his experience in previous rescue missions,  Khalil paints a vivid picture of the complexities of navigating through a war-torn landscape; avoiding snipers, dealing with food shortages, and checkpoint delays are part of the considerations of these missions. ""You need to be aware about (having) enough food with you for the animal because you don't know how long it will take,"" Khalil explained.    The animals in question include lions, hyenas, crocodiles and escaped baboons from the three Gaza zoos identified by Four Paws. Khalil highlights the troubled history of these animals, many of which were smuggled into Gaza through underground tunnels from Egypt. More than 16 years of blocked commercial trade in Gaza by Israel and Egypt resulted in tunnel smuggling systems to fill the gaps, not just for contraband, but for everyday goods and the more unusual cargo of exotic animals. One documented case includes lion cubs purchased in 2008 from Egypt for $3,000 each. The smugglers drugged and transported the lion cubs through one of the many tunnels and brought them into one of Gaza's ill-equipped facilities. ""The people in Gaza deserve to have wild animals and deserve to have a proper place where they can see the animals, but not really a prison because the majority of the animals were kept in poor condition due to the political situation there and the economic situation,"" Khalil said. ""But if Gaza should in the future get a proper condition, I think 100% everyone will assist the people there to live, to see wildlife, but also under international standards. ""Khalil believes saving animals can serve as a beacon of hope. He tells a story of a previous mission to Gaza, in 2016, where he witnessed opposing forces laying down their weapons to allow animals to pass. ""I think to risk a life for such a mission is a candle in the dark to stop the war,"" he said. ",npr_articles/article_39.txt,npr_results/article_39.txt.json
40,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/01/1228133547/israel-gaza-war-palestinian-radio-messages-hostages-prisoners,"TEL AVIV, Israel, and RAMALLAH, West Bank — Thousands of Israeli and Palestinian families know nothing about the fate of their relatives — Israelis held captive in Gaza and Palestinians jailed in Israel — during the Israel-Hamas war. No phone calls. No letters. Just a few short Hamas hostage videos and limited lawyers' visits to Israeli prisons. Even as diplomats try to reach a cease-fire deal for their release, it is an ongoing source of anguish for the families. So Israeli and Palestinian radio stations are broadcasting their voices, hoping their loved ones hear them. Some have. ""People tell you, 'If she listens to you right now, what would you say? What would you want her to hear?' And I always feel like, OK, no way she can hear me,"" says Gil Dickmann, whose cousin's wife was a captive in Gaza. ""But it turns out that, thanks to the fact that radio is such an analog platform, it was possible. ""Distances are short. Airwaves know no borders. Broadcast towers are reaching across the Israeli-Palestinian divide. The Israeli government says 253 Israeli and foreign hostages were taken from southern Israel to Gaza in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that began the war. It's the largest number of civilians taken hostage in Israeli history. Some of the hostages are soldiers. 105 hostages were released by Hamas in late November, in an exchange for Israel releasing 240 Palestinian detainees from prison. Several of the released hostages said their guards allowed them to listen to Israeli radio while they were held in Gaza. Dickmann's relative, Yarden Roman-Gat, is one of them. She was taken captive in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, which Israel says killed some 1,200 people. She was held in a Gaza home. When she returned from captivity, she told her family she had heard Dickmann's voice on Israeli public radio, during a broadcast that was part of a memorial program for victims of the attack. Hearing that broadcast is how she learned what had happened to her family: Her mother-in-law had been killed. Her sister-in-law had also been taken hostage. And her husband and child had survived the Hamas attack. It's also how she knew her family understood she was being held in Gaza. ""She said that that was one of the most important things for her while she was in captivity, keeping her strong, knowing that her husband and child are still alive and that we fight for her,"" Dickmann says. Some of the released hostages say they didn't have any access to a radio or TV in captivity. But the fact that some did has made Israeli radio stations rethink how to broadcast now. Israel estimates 103 hostages are still being held alive in Gaza and that 29 are dead. ""I got so excited, I had tears,"" says Danny Zaken, the head of Galei Zahal, Israeli Army Radio, the country's most-listened to broadcaster, about the moment he heard that Israeli radio broadcasts had reached hostages in Gaza. Since then, Army Radio has been airing voice messages every day from Israelis to their relatives held captive in Gaza, just in case they could hear them. Army Radio's main mission during the war is to reach Israel's soldiers in Gaza, Zaken says, and raise morale by airing personal voice messages from soldiers and their families. The station has distributed about 1,000 small portable transistor radios to Israeli soldiers, who are not allowed to carry cell phones when they enter Gaza. In January, it also piloted an AM radio channel, after discontinuing it many years ago, because the AM frequency is better able to penetrate enclosed environments like reinforced safe rooms for soldiers and civilians along Israel's southern and northern borders — and potentially, Zaken says, Israeli hostages in Gaza. Israel's top drive-time morning show on the most popular music channel, Army Radio's Galgalatz, with 1. 3 million listeners, dedicates the second song of every hour to a specific Israeli hostage in Gaza. ""I really think that they are listening to us,"" anchor Hadar Marks told her listeners one recent morning. ""I hope that the songs that we dedicate to them give them air and strength. ""That morning, she played a Hebrew oldie for Chaim Peri, a 79-year-old hostage. It was ""We Will Meet,"" a nostalgic song from the 1980s by one of Peri's favorite artists, the late Israeli singer-songwriter Arik Einstein. ""We will meet and things will be good,"" Marks said, addressing Peri by name. ""I hope you can hear this. ""Turn the dial to Palestinian radio, and you'll hear something similar. Radio Ajyal, the most listened-to radio station for Palestinians, airs a weekly show called ""Messages of the Prisoners,"" in which a host reads aloud messages and plays voice recordings from the families of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Broadcasting to 1. 2 million listeners on 11 frequencies from its main studio in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Radio Ajyal is one of three Palestinian radio stations airing such programs for years. Israel has jailed many thousands of Palestinians on charges and convictions ranging from killing Israelis to plotting attacks to alleged incitement on Instagram. Palestinians consider them political prisoners. Since the war began, Radio Ajyal has been flooded with calls and voice messages, because there has been a surge of Israeli arrests. The exact number is unclear. Palestinian prisoner advocates estimate Israel has detained more than 6,000 Palestinians since the start of the war. The Israeli legal aid group HaMoked says roughly 3,000 Palestinians, mostly from the West Bank, have been arrested. In addition, many hundreds of Gaza residents are believed to be held in Israeli military detention, arrested in connection with the Oct. 7 attack or during Israel's military assault in Gaza, which has killed more than 24,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials. As of Feb. 1, there are 8,928 Palestinians incarcerated in Israeli jails, according to Israeli prison figures, nearly the highest number in a decade in a half. The majority are being held without charge or are awaiting sentencing. ""It's horrible, after Oct. 7, inside the Israeli prisons,"" says Radio Ajyal's editor-in-chief, Walid Nassar. ""These messages are very crucial for the prisoners inside the prisons when they can't reach. . . outside communication. ""Since the war began, Israel has cut off nearly all communication with the world outside the prison walls. According to the Israeli prison services and legal aid groups, Palestinian prisoners are no longer allowed family visits, the International Committee of the Red Cross no longer has prison access to deliver letters between families and prisoners, and lawyers are given minimal access to meet prisoners. The Israel Prison Service says the wartime measures are for ""operational"" reasons, and to prevent prisoners from coordinating attacks from inside prisons. Israel has not reported any attacks directed from inside prisons since Oct. 7. Palestinian prisoner advocates call the new crackdown in prisons a policy of revenge, following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack and taking of hostages. Five days into the war, Israeli soldiers stormed the Jalazone refugee camp in the West Bank, and took away Ala Al-Din Ali as his family looked on. It is the sixth time Israel has arrested him. In the past, Israel accused him of having ties to Hamas, which the family denies. Israel says it has conducted sweeping arrests of Hamas activists since the war began. Many detainees, like Ali, are held as ""administrative detainees"" without charge, a tactic criticized by human rights groups. Israel says it is needed to prevent future attacks. Ali's 18-year-old daughter, Deema, sent Radio Ajyal a short voice message that the radio station played recently. Addressing her father, she wanted him to know: Everything at home is fine. University is good. Don't worry about us. She has no idea if he's heard it. ""We have no connection to reach to him or to speak with him,"" she says. ""Where's the human rights? Where's the prisoner rights? Even the lawyer can't reach to him. ""Israeli prison authorities say they have confiscated television and radio sets from prisoners, and cut off the electricity from the sockets in prisoners' cells. ""Radio is not allowed,"" says Raed Abu Hommus of the Palestinian Commission for Detainees and Ex Detainees Affairs. ""If they found a radio, you will be isolated. ""During a recent live broadcast of ""Messages of the Prisoners"" on Radio Ajyal, a prisoner released in the November exchange called into the show. Lama Khater, a blogger, had been arrested previously by Israel on allegations of association with Hamas, and was among those arrested after Oct. 7 and held on ""administrative detention"" without charge. The host of the program, Ala'a Al-Amleh, asked Khater on air whether prisoners are still able to hear the radio show inside jail. ""To some extent, until I left, there was a possibility to listen to the radio. The problem now, especially in the period since the war began, is that the constant search operations and confiscation of radios perhaps prevent everyone from listening,"" Khater said. ""But sometimes, even in the same section, if there is one radio, and one person hears it, they might share it with the rest of the cells. ""The radio program usually runs for 90 minutes, but that day, it ran for three hours straight, to broadcast the deluge of messages prisoners' families sent in. Like the Israeli hostages in Gaza, it's unclear whether Palestinian prisoners have access to radio today. ""Maybe there are smuggled radios,"" says Abu Hommus, the prisoner advocate. ""They come searching every two or three days. So I don't think that in every division there [are] more than one or two radios. ""But families still send messages over the airwaves. It's a platform to speak, and you never know who may be listening. For Palestinian and Israeli families, the concern is not knowing about their loved ones held forcibly in extreme and difficult conditions. Anguish has grown as some Israeli hostages and Palestinian detainees have died or been killed while being held. There are growing allegations of physical abuse against Palestinians in Israeli jails and of sexual abuse against Israelis in Hamas captivity. When asked, the Palestinian and Israeli radio directors both resist a comparison of their initiatives. Nassar, Radio Ajyal's editor in chief, questions whether Israeli hostages held deep underground in tunnels can hear the radio at all. Zaken, the head of Israeli Army Radio, says the capture of the Israeli hostages should not be equated to the incarceration of Palestinians. ""I can't do any comparison between these two populations, these two groups, hostages and prisoner terrorists. It's totally different. Here, it's civilians mostly, hostages. And the Palestinian prisoners, most of them are terrorists,"" he says. ""In war against terror, you have to do some measures. Among them is a lot of arrests. That's part of the war. ""But the Israeli radio director acknowledges why Palestinian families would reach out to their loved ones through messages on the radio. ""I can understand what they're doing,"" he says.

41,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/31/1228067573/qatar-prime-minister-negotiating-end-fighting-between-hamas-israel,"It was a high-stakes trip to Washington D. C. for Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani this week. His country is trying to broker a deal between Israel and Hamas that would see an end to fighting, at least temporarily. Any agreement would bring the release of at least some of the 136 remaining hostages taken from Israel during the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. It would also bring some respite to trapped civilians in Gaza living under bombardment and get badly needed aid to a man-made humanitarian disaster zone. After announcing a framework that Hamas is now reviewing, Al Thani sat down with Morning Edition host Leila Fadel. ""I think that we should all unite behind stopping this war, saving those lives, saving those children and those women from being killed and being chased and bombed by airstrikes, by tanks, by everything,"" Al Thani said. He warned that if the conflict between Israel and Hamas doesn't stop soon, the risks of regional war only grow. Al Thani's visit came at a particularly dangerous moment. The U. S. is figuring out how to respond to the killing of three of its reservists in a drone strike in Jordan.  The U. S. blamed an Iran-backed militia. Iran backs several armed groups in the region, including Hamas, that have been striking Israel, U. S. outposts and ships in the Red Sea in protest, they've said, of Israel's response to the Hamas attack. Qatar is a tiny nation in the Persian Gulf that has outsized influence derived from its wealth, the state-funded and popular satellite news channel Al Jazeera and through its role as regional mediator. Qatar has friendly ties with parties and nations who won't speak to each other. It's an ally to the U. S. , which backs Israel, and Iran, which backs Hamas. It also speaks to Hamas at the behest of the U. S. It's used its role as mediator to get other hard deals done. It negotiated a hostage exchange deal between Iran and the U. S. , it negotiated with the Taliban and mediated a deal with Russia to bring home kidnapped Ukrainian children. But in this case, Al Thani made it clear he doesn't know when a breakthrough between Israel and Hamas might come. ""It all depends on both parties,"" he said. ""Our aim is to finish this as soon as possible and to bring the hostages back, but to put a closure for the war as well. ""He adds Qatar's mediating has gotten results that fighting has not, including the release of over 100 hostages. ""The process has proven successful. The military operation didn't do it. It was the contrary, actually. It killed some of them,"" Al Thani said. This conversation with Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Al Jassim Thani has excerpts that were not part of the broadcast version. It has been edited and condensed for clarity and length. Is a deal really possible, especially knowing that Israel is asking for a 45-day pause and Hamas wants an end to the war and the withdrawal of Israeli troops. Is a deal possible with this kind of daylight between the two?We are in a stage where we have an agreed framework with the Israelis and now, it's being presented to Hamas. So we are waiting for the responses and we are hoping for indirect negotiations in the coming days in order to go through the details. Right now, of course, we cannot predict that. It will all depend on both parties, how they are going to agree to the details. Our aim is to finish this as soon as possible and to vote, so to bring the hostages back, but to put a closure for the war as well. I think the framework that Qatar has suggested was based on a proposal that was presented by the Israelis and the counter proposal by Hamas. We blended both together and we came up with this framework, which we are hoping will become acceptable as well to Hamas to move forward with it. You don't see this in days or in the next week? Some type of ceasefire and return of hostages?Sometimes the negotiations can surprise us and can finish in days, but some other times we get stuck into details and it all depends on how the atmosphere will be on the two sides. We're speaking at a time of extremely heightened tensions after a drone strike that killed three U. S. servicemen, wounded many others. How is that impacting negotiations and what are your concerns for the region as the U. S. mulls how to respond to that drone attack?First of all, I'd like to express my condolences for the loss of the U. S. soldiers and for their families. The situation in the region is just stirring up and we've seen the provocations happening everyday and building up. We warned  that the situation would be exploited by others, that it might stir up the region, and might lead us to a wider regional war. That's what we've been preventing, talking to everyone in order to de-escalate and to contain the situation. Is it impacting the negotiation directly? It's not. We are hoping that everything gets contained as soon as possible. We understand that loss. And of course, the U. S. has the right to decide on the way to retaliate. But, let's hope that we have cooler heads ahead of us and don't get out of control. For a lot of Americans. They don't understand Qatar's support for Hamas. If you could talk about why Qatar has been the home for Hamas officials and has had the support of Qatar?Well Qatar actually supports peace. It supports the Palestinian people to live in dignity. We don't support Hamas or any political factions over there. In fact, Qatar's [financial] support goes to the Palestinians. Fifty five percent of that support went to the West Bank and 45 percent went to Gaza and it went directly to the people. It has nothing to do with any political party over there. The Hamas office in Doha, when it was established, happened in coordination with the U. S. and it was for a purpose. This presence has served this purpose throughout the years. Different wars and different conflicts, different escalations. Many of them were seen, but a lot more were contained from a very early stage. It's been serving that purpose and Qatar has said it has been serving as a communication channel between a lot of parties: Hamas, Taliban and others. So, it's part of our role as mediators. Unfortunately, this is being misused against us in many ways. Everytime there's a loss, they try to play the blame game against Qatar. It will discourage any other country from stepping up and playing a role in restoring peace and stability in our region. His Highness, the Emir, has been repeatedly saying to us, just ignore the noise and focus on your objective. If we are saving lives, that will be enough for us. On that note, Israel's far right wing finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said Qatar ""encourages terrorism, finances, terrorism, pushes terror and is playing a double game. "" Leaked audio from Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Qatar problematic and said that your country is failing to use the leverage you have over Hamas since Qatar houses and funds them according to this leak. If you could respond to these remarks, including from a minister that's seen as quite extreme. I won't bother commenting on the irresponsible remarks you have just mentioned, but the premise of funding Hamas is totally rejected. And it's been clear from day one the way we are funding was happening under [Netanyahu's] watch and under his government's watch. And it's a very legitimate, transparent process that goes directly to the people and is verified by the U. N. I believe that all the people who know and who understand the process, they know that these are lies and they are just trying to mislead the public opinion. Listen to Morning Edition each day here or on your local member station for more interviews like this. I want to ask about Israel's stated goal of this war and what the U. S. echoes to eradicate Hamas, in your view? Is that possible?Well, eradicating a group does not have a definition. The definition is killing. We have seen the results of the war right now. More than 25,000 have been killed. Two thirds of them are children and women. Is that part of eradicating Hamas? If you want to replace an idea, you have to present a better idea. The better idea is prospects for the Palestinians, is a political horizon and that's what all of us are seeking. Should Hamas have a role in future Palestinian governance?This is not for us to decide. It's the Palestinian people's decision. And I think they are capable of deciding on their fate, on their future. What we're doing here is supporting Palestinians and we would like to see our political prospects for them to have their statehood. But as a country that engages with Hamas, do you think it's possible for them to have a constructive role? One Hamas official did say they would repeat October 7th again and again. So do you see a future in which Hamas could have a constructive role?Well, actually, if there are political prospects and they are willing to adhere and to live with that, it's up to their people to decide their fate. I think that's basically a fair position from our country. We see that the Palestinian people are the only ones who have the right to say with whom they want to govern. And what we need is to present them with better options. That's what all of us should stand for. You're in the U. S. this week speaking to U. S. officials. You've been speaking to US officials throughout this negotiation process. What is Qatar's main message to the U. S. as you describe a region, as you put it, that's boiling over?Well, we need to focus on ending this war. We need to focus on overcoming the obstacles on the hostage deal and how to contain the situation in the region and how to ensure that there are better prospects for the Palestinian in order not to have such a conflict in the future. If this doesn't end soon, what are the risks for a full regional war that drags the U. S. , Qatar and others into it?Well, it will always remain a risk as long as this conflict continues. And I don't think that the situation is tolerable anymore. We've seen the humanitarian suffering and loss is something that we didn't witness in any modern war, as it is the only place where the people have no safe place to flee to. It's horrifying. It's heartbreaking. The audio portion of this interview was produced by Milton Guevara. It was edited by Jan Johnson. ",npr_articles/article_41.txt,npr_results/article_41.txt.json
42,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/31/1227964976/gaza-hospital-israel-childbirth-babies-mothers-pregnant,"Delivered into hell. That is how Tess Ingram of the U. N. Children's Fund — or UNICEF — describes the world that newborn babies are meeting in Gaza. Ingram recently spent a week observing the conditions at two hospitals there. UNICEF estimates that about 20,000 babies have been born in Gaza since Israel began its offensive there in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack. Only about a third of the territory's hospitals are still partially functioning, and Ingram says pregnant women have trouble accessing even the most basic of medical services. She spoke to NPR's Sarah McCammon about what she saw while on the ground. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Tess Ingram: The care that people are able to receive is incredibly limited. The hospitals are so very crowded because there's just so many people in need, both from injuries from the war but also from preexisting conditions [for which they] need to continue to receive treatment, and then, of course, women giving birth and the care that their newborn babies need. I spoke to one woman who was living in the middle area of Gaza. And when her house was hit, her husband was buried under the rubble for several days, and her baby stopped moving inside of her. And she said that she wasn't able to get a scan or any sort of assessment of the baby's condition. When I met her, it had been a month after that terrible incident. And she confirmed her husband was fortunately rescued and he was OK, but she was sure that their baby was dead, and she was waiting for medical care. So these are the sorts of things that women are experiencing even before they get to a hospital. And then once they're there, for example, anesthetic is not something that's easily available, let alone other more usual medications that women might receive. Sarah McCammon: And I'm sorry. The woman you just described — you said her husband was ultimately rescued, but what about the baby?Ingram: So she was waiting when I met her at the Emirati hospital to see a doctor. But baby hadn't moved in about a month. And she said that she was sure that the baby was dead. And we spoke for a long time, and she was obviously distraught by the whole situation. It was her second pregnancy. But she said to me, you know, ""I think it's best that a baby isn't born into this nightmare — it was probably meant to be. "" Which was just heartbreaking. McCammon: For those who are able to make it to a hospital and give birth there in Gaza, what happens afterward? I mean, how long, for example, are they able to stay in the hospital after the birth?Ingram: Not long at all. So at the moment, because of the sheer lack of staff compared to the enormous needs, women are having caesareans and then getting a short amount of time, maybe an hour or two, in a bed before being put in a chair because they need that bed for somebody else, and then being discharged within about three hours unless there is some kind of urgent need for them to stay in the hospital. So mothers are leaving hours after having a serious caesarean operation, with a newborn baby, back to the streets in many cases. We're talking about displaced women returning to makeshift shelters of tarpaulins and blankets on the streets of Gaza, where they're not only at threat because of the bombardments, but they also don't have basic things like clean water or food or even clothes for the baby. I met one mother who was taking her newborn baby back to their tent, and the baby didn't have any clothes. McCammon: We've learned in recent days that several nations, including the United States, have suspended funding to one of the key United Nations agencies involved in providing aid to people in Gaza. That's the agency known as UNRWA. And that decision came after Israel presented evidence alleging that a dozen UNRWA employees were involved in the Oct. 7 attacks. How much is that development harming efforts to help infants and new mothers in Gaza?Ingram: The situation was already at a breaking point. When I was in Gaza, I could just see just how exhausted people are by more than 100 days of war. And nothing justifies the horrific events on the 7th of October, and these are extremely serious allegations which are being investigated, but ultimately I think what we need to keep in front of mind is what happens to the children of Gaza when they're already at this breaking point when the major U. N. agency in Gaza is not able to fully function?So I think that's the thing that we at UNICEF are thinking about at the moment and making sure that the needs of the children in Gaza can continue to be met.",npr_articles/article_42.txt,npr_results/article_42.txt.json
43,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2024/01/30/1227849885/a-holocaust-survivor-identifies-with-the-pain-of-both-sides-in-the-israel-hamas-,"Last week, the International Court of Justice issued a preliminary ruling that the charge brought by South Africa that Israel is guilty of genocide in Gaza is ""plausible. "" The court called on Israel to take all measures to prevent the killing of civilians in the Palestinian enclave. As expected, the court's decision is controversial, with both those in favor and those expressing disapproval. It's not the first time that a direct or indirect reference to the Holocaust has surfaced since the war began after Hamas struck southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostages. The day of the attack has been described as the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. In late September, days before the Hamas attack, we interviewed Estelle Laughlin, a Holocaust survivor, about a study that examined whether social connections improved the odds of someone surviving a concentration camp like Auschwitz. According to the authors, the answer was yes, but by the smallest of margins. We got back in touch with Laughlin this month to ask her how, as someone who lived through the Nazi genocide, she reacts to this current crisis — and the suffering on both sides. In the fall of 1939, when Germany invaded Poland, Laughlin was 10 years old. She and her family were among the 400,000 Jews who were soon forced to move into the Warsaw Ghetto. Despite fierce acts of resistance, including the Warsaw Ghetto uprising that her father helped to organize, most of the Jews there were unable to save themselves from the Nazi extermination campaign. Laughlin, her older sister and her mother were transported in cattle cars to the Lublin-Majdanek concentration camp in the spring of 1943 and later to two other forced labor camps, all within Poland. The Soviets liberated her months before World War II officially ended. However, ""my father — and nearly everyone I knew and loved — were murdered,"" she says. ""No one came to our rescue, no country let us in. As a result, 6 million of my people were gassed in concentration camps. ""To Laughlin, Israel has represented the one safe harbor in the world for Jews who've been persecuted for generations. ""History is proof why the existence of Israel is essential,"" she says. ""I think the conscience of the world owes the Jewish people the safety of having their own country. "" Indeed, a few of her friends — fellow survivors — moved to Israel after World War II. She has some family there too. But now she feels that October 7 has endangered that refuge. Laughlin doesn't remember how she first learned of the events of October 7, when Hamas launched its deadly attack against Israel. But that difficult day haunts her. ""Once you have [endured] a dramatic experience like the Holocaust,"" says Laughlin, ""some part of [it] stays with you all your life. "" The attack by Hamas and ensuing war reawakened in her a decades-old sadness that human cruelty still burns strongly in the world. Laughlin says she identifies with Israel and the Jews whose lives were threatened or taken. But the stories and images of Palestinian suffering and loss that have poured out of Gaza feel eerily familiar to her, too. ""To me, they are human beings like I am a human being,"" she says. ""I want the best for them as I want the best for us. """"All life is sacred,"" she continues. ""And it's unfortunate that human beings have to feel threatened for generations for no good reason. It's devastating. ""Laughlin sees the Hamas attack as the latest eruption in a historic current of violence directed against Jews. ""We contribute to the good of all humanity,"" she says, ""and yet we are so often persecuted. ""Laughlin says that as a young woman, her mother was chased out of Belarus for being Jewish. And yet she told Laughlin that the Russians were ""a suffering people. """"And I couldn't understand,"" she says, ""how could she have sympathy for somebody who chased her out of her little shtetl?"" Somehow, her mother identified with the suffering of those who'd imposed suffering upon her. ""And that amazed me. ""When Laughlin was a schoolgirl in Warsaw, children regularly pelted her and the other Jewish kids with pebbles. ""We were so frightened,"" she recalls. ""The antisemitism was right in front of me — it was so visceral. ""Then came the German and Soviet occupation of Poland, the ghetto and worse. To the Nazis, ""we had no value as human beings,"" she says. As Laughlin tells it, in those most difficult of times, her community of Jewish people found ways of supporting one another. ""We recognized the sanctity of simple moments with friends — that was our sustenance,"" she says. For Laughlin, besides luck, it was her mother and sister who helped her make it out of the camps alive. ""We were like one organism,"" she recalls. ""The people in our barrack called us the three monkeys in a very affectionate way because we would pick the lice from each other's heads to relieve the itching. In order to survive a hell like a ghetto or concentration camp, you had to have something to hold onto. So you hold onto memories, you hold onto love. I doubt that my mother, my sister or I would have survived without the other. """"Love maintained us,"" she says. One day at the concentration camp in Majdanek, Laughlin spotted her sister's name on a list. She and her sister and mom had a pact — if one of them was to be sent to the crematorium, all three would go together. ""So my mother and I, we traded places with two women who were on the list who hoped to see another sunrise,"" she says. ""And the following day, my mother and I went with my sister, absolutely sure that we are being marched to the crematorium. ""Instead, they were taken to work at an ammunition factory in a forced labor camp. Ultimately, in 1947, two years after they were liberated, Laughlin, her sister, and mother all made it to the U. S. And she says she survived with an enduring sense of compassion and love for humanity, including for the Germans. ""Without those values, survival would be hardly meaningful,"" she says. To Laughlin, Israel has represented the one safe harbor in the world for Jews who've been persecuted throughout their history. Indeed, a few of her friends — fellow survivors — moved to Israel after the war. She has some family there too. But now she feels that October 7 has endangered that refuge. Laughlin says the Hamas attack was directed at Jews, resulting in hundreds of deaths and the more than 200 hostages being taken into Gaza. The events set in motion by that day have shaken ""the security of my people, of my children, of my grandchildren,"" she says. Laughlin's cousins who live in Israel have told her how frightened they've felt these last several months. Over that same time period, Laughlin has also been watching and reading the news coming out of Gaza. The enclave has been devastated by Israel's military response — the leveling of buildings, the displacement of nearly two million people, soaring rates of starvation and disease and the deaths of more than 26,000 Palestinians. Laughlin says she's holding the Jewish pain of this war alongside the Palestinian pain. ""When the dignity of any human being is diminished, the dignity of all humanity is diminished,"" she says. ""Not only in relationship to my community but to any community of innocent people being attacked. ""When Laughlin considers the Palestinians living in Gaza, she says, ""I identify with their plight . . . with their isolation that the rest of the world keeps on going on as though nothing happened, and their world is crumbling. """"I feel their pain,"" she adds. ""I know their insecurity. I think suffering needs witness. ""As a measure of self-protection, one she's unintentionally honed in the decades since her childhood in Poland, she bears witness with empathy but ""with a distance. ""Laughlin has a metaphor for the intractability of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. ""I guess it's like when you see somebody hitting their head against the wall. And you say, 'It hurts — why don't you stop?'""""I am an old woman,"" Laughlin reflects. ""I wanted to leave this planet, this Earth, a better place than I found it. It's sad to see that people are still so self-destructive. We live in the 21st century. We accumulated so much knowledge, but our values are still Stone Age. We have not learned to control our emotions. ""She longs for a better way forward. ""There are two people claiming the same piece of land, and that's a problem,"" she says. ""Somehow, they'll have to work it out. I hope that they will use [their] better instincts [of] compassion and reason. I have faith that there are bright, well-meaning, resourceful people — both among the Arabs and among the Jews in Israel. And that they will listen to their wiser parts, [their] kinder parts. . . and find a resolution. """,npr_articles/article_43.txt,npr_results/article_43.txt.json

In a statement, the Israeli military said one of the people belonged to Hamas and was planning an imminent attack ""inspired by the events of October 7. ""The head of surgery at Ibn Sina Hospital, Dr. Tawfiq al-Shawbaky, told NPR that the man was a patient, paralyzed and using a wheelchair.

45,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/30/1226618464/israel-universities-gaza-war-arab-students,"HAIFA, Israel — The University of Haifa sits high on a hill overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, offering spectacular views from Mount Carmel for its 17,000 students. It is Israel's most diverse university — about 40% of students are Palestinian citizens of Israel. It's a place where you can hear both Hebrew and Arabic, and where learning — until recently — overrode many of Israel's deep divisions. That delicate equilibrium changed Oct. 7, when Hamas militants attacked Israel. Throughout the country, Jewish and Palestinian citizens are sharing an increasingly tense space since the Gaza war began, including at universities. That's especially true after some Arab students have been accused of posting pro-Hamas comments on social media. ""For example, one student uploaded a story which in the story you can see an IDF [Israeli military] vehicle burnt,"" recalls Daniel Amar, a Jewish student and head of the University of Haifa's student union. ""And she wrote 'The happiest day of my life. ' We can't accept it. ""The university suspended at least eight Arab students for their social media posts and for what it called ""support for the terrorist attack on towns surrounding Gaza and the murder of innocents,"" and it launched a disciplinary review in October. Amar believes this was the correct move. ""It's a clear statement, OK, from the university that we . . . will not support terror and terror-supporting on our campus,"" he says. Others disagreed. At least 25 professors from the school, many of them Jews, wrote a letter to the rector, Gur Alroey, urging the school to investigate rather than automatically throwing the Arab students out. Alroey wrote back, saying the students were suspended because they published posts that expressed ""clear support for the terror of Hamas and the murder of innocents. "" He said the alternative, which he did not choose, would have been to report them to police. In his letter, which NPR has reviewed, he told the professors he was ""astonished"" by the professors' letter, which he said was ""detached from all reality"" as Israeli society was going through an ""unprecedented difficult period"" since the Oct. 7 attacks. ""Jewish, Christian, Druze and Muslim students study at the University of Haifa, who came across posts on social media by some of their classmates,"" he wrote. ""It is our duty to protect the entire Haifa University community here — students, academic staff and administrative staff, and students affected by the war need our protection and support now, more than ever. ""The university did not respond to NPR's requests for comment, though it did ultimately decide to reinstate the eight suspended students while it conducts an investigation. As'ad Ghanem, a professor of comparative politics, is one of the Arab faculty members who signed the letter to the rector. He also wrote privately about his concerns to the chair of the university's executive committee, Dov Weissglas. Ghanem claims Weissglas responded negatively to his private communication. Weissglas did not respond to NPR requests for comment. ""The university should be part of thinking about ways of reconciliation and . . . helping our students,"" Ghanem says. Repercussions against Arab students stretch far beyond the University of Haifa, says Adi Mansour, a political and civil rights attorney with Adalah, an organization advocating for the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel. Adalah is representing the eight suspended students at the University of Haifa and almost 100 total throughout Israel. Mansour says the Arab Palestinian Student Union estimates there are about 150 cases of alleged persecution on campuses in all. ""The cases vary from posting quotes from the Quran or posting sympathy with Gaza,"" he says. ""In our opinion, all of the cases fall within the limits of freedom of expression. ""Mansour says it's not unusual to see a crackdown against Arabs in Israel whenever there is a war with Hamas or Hezbollah. But this, he says, is the worst he's seen it. ""In previous wars, we've never seen universities and colleges operate in such a way against their own students,"" he says. ""This is by far the first time that we see this large amount of disciplinary procedures against students for expressing themselves. ""On a clear afternoon earlier this month, Arab and Jewish students sat side by side, enjoying an outdoor lunch on campus. Yuval Shlisel, with Standing Together, a social movement working for peace between Jews and Arabs, says most students at the University of Haifa don't want to bring the war onto campus. ""The majority of the students do want to keep coming to the campuses, to study together and to have good grades in the final exams,"" he says. ""The majority of the students, they don't want this fight. ""But Shlisel, a student at the University of Haifa, says fear and anti-Arab sentiment are being whipped up on social media by students belonging to far-right organizations on campus. ""The far-right organizations, they started to . . . convince the other students . . . now we don't just fight against the terror organization Hamas. We also need to fight against the terror supporters, so-called, in Israel,"" he says. ""And for them, every Arabs and every Jews that don't think like them is . . . potentially terror support. ""Some Arab students say they now feel unwelcome at the university because of the war. Twenty-one-year-old Ibrahim is an Arab first-year law student. He has Palestinian friends in Gaza and feels passionately about the soaring civilian casualties there. More than 26,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the Gaza health ministry. But he's afraid to express himself — or use his last name with NPR — because he may be seen as an enemy. ""If I say that I'm against genocide, I'm against the war in Gaza, if I say I'm against killing civilians in Gaza, I feel like that would classify me in [university students' and administrators'] eyes as a terrorist,"" he says. The concern and fear are also felt by many Arab — and some Jewish — teachers. Students have threatened some teachers, including Ghanem. He says one threatened to punch him, another to deface his office. Ghanem had a security camera installed in his office to deter future threats. He worries about repercussions if he talks publicly or in classes about the war or Arab-Jewish relations. Some Jewish students won't attend classes taught by professors they deem as not forcefully condemning the Oct. 7 attack. ""I think that now I am more sensitive and I'm limiting myself in certain expressions. And this will harm my ability to teach my students,"" Ghanem says. ""I want to feel more free, more confident that I can say anything within certain limitation. ""Earlier this month, the university reversed its decision and reinstated the Arab students while an investigation is carried out. Student union president Amar is angry with that decision. He is a reservist and takes time away from his studies to fight Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militia, along Israel's northern border. He says he almost died three or four times in recent fighting. ""And I can't even imagine a situation which I sit in my . . . class, and next to me sit[s] a person that want[s] me to die,"" he says. ""He don't deserve to learn here. ""As an army reservist, Amar carries a pistol tucked into his waistband. Other reservists on campus are required to carry their army-issued assault rifles. This worries Ibrahim, the Arab student. ""When I go to a [lecture] hall, I think twice before saying anything, because the one sitting next to me holds a gun,"" he says. ""How can I feel comfortable right after that?""",npr_articles/article_45.txt,npr_results/article_45.txt.json
46,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/30/1227578480/rabbis-offer-pastoral-care-for-those-traumatized-by-oct-7-hamas-attack,"The entrance to the Shefayim beachside hotel just north of Tel Aviv has a grim reminder of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks. ""There is a huge board here with names of two dozen people who were taken hostages to Gaza,"" says Rabbi Yael Vurgan as she points to the ceiling-high sign in the lobby. Some of the hostages have been returned. ""The red dots are the five hostages from Kfar Aza that are still in Gaza,"" she says. ""It's really unbearable that there are still people — young people — hostages in Gaza. ""Kfar Aza is a kibbutz where Hamas militants killed scores of residents. Survivors have been evacuated to this beach resort and have no idea when they'll be able to return home. Kfar Aza is one of the 10 kibbutzim near Gaza that Vurgan has served for the last five years — leading Shabbat services, preparing kids for their bar or bat mitzvahs and more recently attending funerals. Since October, she's has been to more than 60 — some with multiple coffins because militants killed entire families. ""People who are so traumatized have a need to talk about what happened to them,"" Vurgan says, ""although we might think that they don't want to talk about it. But people really, really need to tell their story again and again. ""They also want to hear what their tradition has to offer during these painful days. The Oct. 7 attacks on Israel displaced tens of thousands of Jews from their kibbutzim near Gaza. Since then, rabbis have been crisscrossing the country offering trauma-informed pastoral care to victims. Those who've been displaced from their kibbutzim have ended up all over the country — some like those from Kfar Aza at sea-side hotels. Others are cast out from their rural lives, now living in big cities. ""Now we will see the little kindergarteners,"" says Techelet Grabowsky as she walks past a make-shift indoor playground outside the basement conference rooms of the five star Orient Hotel in Jerusalem. The sounds of toddlers from the kibbutz Or HaNer spill into the hall as Grabowsky, who helped set up in the kindergarten, opens the door. ""Hi guys!"" she smiles as she greets the class. ""These are the little ones — one year old until three year old. ""Fifteen children in this room alone, playing with wooden blocks and tiny plastic kitchen sets. Grabowsky and hundreds of others fled from their homes at Or HaNer, near Gaza, on Oct. 7. The day is still very present in her mind. She stares into the middle distance as she remembers a constant stream of text messages flooding her phone that morning. She could see Hamas fighters coming toward the kibbutz. ""I have the, like, 5 minutes choice,"" she says emphatically about the decision to stay and fight or flee with her family. ""Understand the picture: My husband with a knife from the kitchen. I am with a machete from the backyard. ""These were the only weapons they had to defend themselves as they packed their 4-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son into the car and sped away. Eventually, the family ended up at the Orient Hotel, sharing one room. ""It's a miracle we are alive,"" Grabowsky says. While she's grateful every day, she says she's also left pleading with God, ""Why us? Why now?""Grabowsky describes herself as more spiritual than religious, but these questions of faith have become pressing the longer she's away from her home. She feels betrayed by her own government, her own long-held belief that peace was possible and by the Gazans she'd work alongside for years. Grabowsky is a self-described ""peacenik kibbutznik"" who has reconsidered her views in recent months. ""We talk about the big rupture in believing in humanity, in the good of a person,"" she says. ""Who's the other party we want to do so badly peace with? They don't want peace. They want to murder us all. ""That's a broad-brush view of Palestinians many Israelis hold as military actions in Gaza continue. These questions of ultimate concern are common among those who wonder when or if they'll every be able to return to their kibbutzim and their simple, bucolic lives. With help from rabbis, Grabowsky says she's reformulating a way of talking about her spirituality. ""I believe in good and bad. I believe in the Ten Commandments,"" she says. The question for her now is how to respond when what has been done to her has left her home destroyed, her friends dead and her family in exile. Among those offering pastoral care at hotels filled with displaced people is Rabbi Tamar Elad-Applebaum. She recounts a recent visit with a family far from their home. ""I saw just as I entered one of the hotels, a child hiding himself underneath the table and holding on to the leg of the table,"" Elad-Applebaum says. ""And I remember seeing his mother going down underneath the table and sitting next to him. ""In the same way that the mother, traumatized herself, sought to comfort her child, Elad-Applebaum says rabbis figuratively sit underneath a table and hand Jews the tools that are closest to their hearts to understand and process the trauma of Oct. 7. Elad-Applebaum has been a rabbi for more than two decades and helps direct Jerusalem's educational Shalom Hartman Institute. ""One of the first things that trauma creates is the loss of language,"" she says. ""You just have no language for what you saw. You have no language for what your eyes witnessed, for what your heart trembles from. ""But when one's own language fails, Elad-Applebaum says that's where scripture and tradition can lend words. ""At the beginning of the Torah — the Hebrew Bible — it says that God saw that there is an abyss,"" she says. ""And only then sending his spirit onto it, he created light. So light is something you plant only on the abyss. ""The aftermath of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that left more than 1,200 dead and hundreds taken hostage has been an abyss for many Israelis. It's also a dark time for the people of Gaza, where more than 26,000 have been killed through Israeli military action, according health officials there. During the months Elad-Applebaum has been visiting the displaced victims of the Hamas attacks, she has kept these words from Psalm 1 close to her heart to keep herself and others from growing bitter:""Blessed is the person who does not go in the ways of the cruel,"" she says, switching back and forth between English to Hebrew, ""who does not stop where cruelty sits.

On Sunday, an aerial drone strike killed three United States service members and injured at least 34 others. The strike happened at a support base known as Tower 22 in northeast Jordan near the Syrian border and likely hit a barracks. ""We had a tough day last night in the Middle East. We lost three brave souls,"" President Biden said on Monday. ""And we shall respond. ""This is the first fatal attack on U. S. forces in the Middle East since the war in Gaza broke out following the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel that left some 1,200 people dead. An Iran-backed umbrella group of militias called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq said it was behind the attack, but Iran denied involvement. The group called it revenge for America's military presence in the region and the Palestinian deaths in Gaza. More than 26,000 people have been killed since the beginning of Israel's war on Hamas, according to the health ministry in Gaza. There have been about 160 attacks on U. S. bases in the region since the Gaza war broke out, according to the Pentagon. ""There will be a response"" to Sunday's attack, John Kirby, spokesman for the National Security Council, told NPR's Steve Inskeep on Monday, and it will be ""calibrated to hopefully have a better effect on the decision-making of these groups. """"We're going to take the right time to make the appropriate response decisions in the wake of this attack,"" he said. ""The president has taken this very seriously. ""President Biden met on Monday with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and others, including his Middle East envoy Brett McGurk, to discuss the growing threats. Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported that the Syrian military said that Israeli strikes outside the capital Damascus on Monday killed and wounded several people. Syrian state media said that among the dead were ""a number of Iranian advisers,"" Reuters reported. Israel declined to comment on the strikes. The AP also reported on Monday that Yemen's Houthi rebels said they attacked a U. S. Navy mobile base in the Gulf of Aden. The claim was denied by the U. S. The Iranian-backed Houthis have been attacking international cargo ships in the Red Sea with drones and missiles since November. They have said it is a reaction to Israel's war in Gaza. The U. S has responded with its own strikes. Kirby described Sunday's attack in Jordan as ""escalatory"" but insisted that the U. S. was not, however, talking about the latest spike in violence as a regional war. ""We do not want to see a wider conflict,"" Kirby said. ""In fact, everything the president has done since the seventh of October has really been designed to try to de-escalate, to try to prevent a wider conflict. . . . We are not looking for a war with Iran. ""Nevertheless, an expert on the region told NPR Monday that the U. S. already appears to be swept up in a low-grade war. ""There have been some backchannel communications between Washington and Tehran to say they don't want the war that has been playing out since Oct. 7 between Israel and Gaza to expand,"" Robin Wright, a distinguished fellow at the Wilson Center, told Morning Edition's Inskeep. ""But frankly, I think we've crossed that threshold now,"" she said.

Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Israeli attacks have killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, most of whom are women and children, and displaced about 85% of people in the territory. Hamas militants killed some 1,200 people in Israel in the Oct. 7 attack and seized some 250 hostages, about 100 of whom are still alive and being held, according to Israeli officials. ""What we have to do is try to stop the suffering and gossip,"" Pelosi said. ""This is women and children. People don't have a place to go. So let's address that. ""The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim advocacy organization, condemned Pelosi's comments as ""unsubstantiated smears"" that the group said echoes messaging meant to dehumanize Palestinian people. ""We are deeply disturbed by Former House Speaker Pelosi's comments,"" CAIR's national executive director Nihad Awad said in a statement. ""Rep. Pelosi's claim that some of the Americans protesting for a Gaza ceasefire are working with Vladmir Putin sounds delusional and her call for the FBI to investigate those protesters without any evidence is downright authoritarian. ""In response to NPR's request for comment, a spokesperson for Rep. Pelosi stood by her comments, adding that Pelosi has always supported the right of Americans to express their views through peaceful protest. ""As Speaker Pelosi said on CNN, we have to focus on stopping the suffering in Gaza, and she will continue demanding that all hostages be freed now,"" the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""Informed by three decades on the House Intelligence Committee, Speaker Pelosi is acutely aware of how foreign adversaries meddle in American politics to sow division and impact our elections, and she wants to see further investigation ahead of the 2024 election.

The three were identified as Sgt. William Jerome Rivers, 46, of Carrollton, Ga. ; Spc. Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, of Waycross, Ga. ; and Spc. Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23, of Savannah, Ga. The three were all reservists assigned to the 718th Engineer Company in Fort Moore, Ga. Meanwhile, the number of those wounded in the attack rose to more than 40, the Pentagon announced on Monday. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said President Biden is committed to holding accountable those behind the drone strike, adding that the attack was ""escalatory"" and ""requires a response. ""But Kirby also emphasized that ""we are not looking for a war with Iran,"" which U. S. officials say played a role in the attack. ""We'll do that on our schedule, in our time, and we'll do it in a manner of the president's choosing as commander in chief,"" he said. The attack in Jordan marks the first deadly attack on U. S. forces in the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas broke out with the Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7. The U. S. has been attempting to contain the conflict and prevent it from spreading further in the region. The aerial drone struck container housing units at Tower 22, a remote base in northeast Jordan near the Syrian border, early Sunday. Tower 22 supports the Al-Tanf Garrison in southeastern Syria, where U. S. special operations have long operated in tandem with other countries in combating Islamic State militants. About 350 U. S. Army and Air Force personnel are deployed to the base. Central Command said at least eight service members were evacuated out of Jordan to receive higher level care but they are in stable condition. A U. S. official told NPR that the service members' injuries vary, with many suffering from traumatic brain injury. There are also reports of a spinal injury and at least one case of a shrapnel wound. U. S. military has been under scrutiny after reports that air defenses at Tower 22 possibly mistook the enemy's drone for an American one which was operating around the same time and level of the attacker. The confusion was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a coalition of militias backed by Iran, claimed credit for the attack. The group called it revenge for America's military presence in the region and the Palestinian death toll in Gaza. More than 25,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to Gaza's health ministry. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed to have attacked a total of four military bases on Sunday — three of which are U. S. bases in Syria and on the Syrian-Jordanian border, and one belonging to Israel. There has been no confirmation of other attacks from U. S. officials. Iranian officials deny the country had any involvement in the drone strike, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. But U. S. officials say they are confident that Iran played a role in the attack, though it is too soon to say if Iran directed the strike. ""We know that Iran is behind it,"" said Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh at a press conference on Monday. ""Iran continues to arm and equip these groups to launch these attacks. ""Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin described the service members as ""brave Americans"" who were deployed to northeastern Jordan to ""work for the lasting defeat of ISIS. """"The President and I will not tolerate attacks on American forces, and we will take all necessary actions to defend the United States, our troops, and our interests,"" he said in a statement Sunday. About 900 U. S. troops are stationed in Syria and 2,500 in Iraq, largely to help fight ISIS. Since the Israel-Hamas war started, Iranian-linked forces have carried out more than 140 attacks in those two countries. Earlier this month, Central Command said a ""number"" of U. S. military personnel were evaluated for traumatic brain injuries after Iran-backed groups launched multiple ballistic missiles and rockets on an airbase in western Iraq. Most of the missiles were intercepted but at least one Iraqi service member was wounded, it added. In December, three U. S. service members were injured, one critically, by a drone strike in northern Iraq. In response, the U. S. said it carried out multiple airstrikes against facilities used by militants.

51,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/28/1227454455/gaza-puppeteer-doesnt-let-the-war-stop-his-passion,"RAFAH, Gaza — Sitting outside a tin shed, surrounded by blankets draped over rope for privacy, Yousef al-Hindi carefully slices a piece of styrofoam into the shape of an arm. The material squeaks as he slowly breaks bits off. Before the war in Gaza, al-Hindi was a successful puppeteer and social worker from the Shateh refugee camp in Gaza. He used puppets to treat children's anxiety, anger and trauma and he co-founded Camp Theatre, a traveling children's puppet theater. He proudly posted about it on his Facebook account a day before the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks that started the war. Al-Hindi practiced the rare and storied craft of marionettes and puppetry using his own set of professional tools and colorful paints. Al-Hindi is now homeless, displaced in Rafah on the Egyptian border, living in the wasteland that is Gaza today. His toolbox left behind, he now uses instruments he has fashioned from tin and wood. He builds a puppet by cannibalizing a broken, empty refrigerator where there is no stable electricity to run it, let alone enough food to store in one. He uses medical supplies like plaster and cotton he saved from a cast he wore on his foot after sustaining an injury a few months ago. That puppet is grey, devoid of color, bearing his own name, Yousef — a mirror image of his own pain. Unlike other puppets al-Hindi has created, Yousef carries a burden: the burden and pain of being a displaced Palestinian, a person without a home, and a future that is uncertain. ""I have made many puppets, but Yousef carries a story that has affected me before it has affected others,"" he said. ""Every time I hold the puppet or work on it, I feel how much difficulty we live in, and I empty my emotional energy into it. ""The puppet is also based on a real child called Yousef who was killed during the war and who has come to symbolize all the Palestinian children killed. In a viral video, 7-year-old Yousef's parents desperately search for their son in a hospital where the father is a doctor. ""He is a sweet boy with curly hair,"" his mother calls out. Eventually, the father recognizes his son in the morgue. Al-Hindi said working on the puppet is ""an internal struggle. """"I speak to myself. . . I try to channel the situation we are living in through the puppet,"" he said. ""And I try to tell the story that runs through my mind and through every displaced person's mind. ""Al-Hindi's surroundings might be bleak, but he is still driven by the well-being of young people. ""My goal is to distract the children from the crisis we are living in, and put a smile on their faces,"" he said. ""To send a message that children are a source of hope. ""His life's routine has been upended by the war — bread lines, waiting for electricity and water, the sounds of explosions — and the only time he is able to create now is in the evening when things are relatively calm. ""I mean the calm of where we are, and not a calmness in the sky,"" he said, referring to the constant whirring of drones and explosions of Israeli aerial strikes. Al-Hindi only got to perform once with the travelling theatre he helped found. The war in Gaza broke out and quickly shattered that dream. But he is determined. Al-Hindi intends for Yousef the puppet to eventually travel via the medium of video, speaking different languages, reaching not only the children of Gaza but the whole world. ""He will spread the message that Palestinian children continue to be killed, that the war in Gaza must stop,"" he said.",npr_articles/article_51.txt,npr_results/article_51.txt.json
52,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/28/1226111057/west-bank-palestinian-freedom-theater-jenin-israel-war,"JENIN REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank — All actor Jamal Abu Joas could think about, as Israeli soldiers beat and dragged him out of his house last month, was a recent play performed at the theater where he works — a dark comedy about Israeli jails. It was an Arabic adaptation of a 1973 play set in apartheid-era South Africa called ""The Island. "" In the original, the characters are imprisoned on Cape Town's notorious Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela served 18 of his 27 years behind bars. In the version performed last year at the West Bank's Freedom Theatre, the characters were Palestinians jailed in Israel. ""It's a comedy that speaks to the reality,"" Abu Joas, 23, explains. ""There is no life in prison. They just keep you alive for another day. ""That's something Abu Joas would soon learn himself. On Dec. 13, he became one of what human rights groups and Palestinians officials estimate is more than 6,000 Palestinians arrested by Israeli forces in the West Bank since the start of the Gaza war. Abu Joas was never charged. He denies any wrongdoing, and was released after eight days. In addition to arresting Abu Joas and two of his colleagues, Israeli soldiers also ransacked, vandalized and forced the closure of the Freedom Theatre. Founded in 2006 in a Palestinian refugee camp that's been a hub of two violent intifada uprisings, the theater has been celebrated by actors and playwrights worldwide. Now it's one of the latest casualties of violence that's spread across the West Bank since Oct. 7. There are near-daily Israeli military incursions and even some airstrikes on United Nations refugee camps, including in the Jenin camp, where the Freedom Theatre is based. The United Nations says more than 350 Palestinians have been killed, along with five Israelis, since the war began. The theater's artistic director, Ahmed Tobasi, arrested with Abu Joas, was released within 24 hours. But general manager Mustafa Sheta remains in Israeli custody. The theater says he's been sentenced to six months of administrative detention. That's a classification Israel uses, under martial law, to hold suspects without charge. Israel says its raids on the West Bank are preemptive, aimed at thwarting another attack like the one on Oct. 7, when Hamas-led militants crossed from Gaza into Israel and killed some 1,200 people. The Jenin refugee camp was built for Palestinians displaced in 1948, when Israel was created. It's home to about 24,000 residents, according to the U. N. There are four schools and one health center. It looks like any other bustling, lower-income urban area in the occupied West Bank. But for decades, the camp has also been a hub for militants fighting Israeli occupation. Gunshots rang out there when NPR visited in mid-January. (Locals said it was their own ""practice"" fire). The camp is an infamously restive place, and the target of many previous Israeli military operations. An Israeli military spokesperson told NPR the Dec. 13 raid on the Freedom Theatre was part of ""counterterrorism activity"" in the surrounding refugee camp. The spokesperson, who, according to military policy, declined to be named, also would not comment on individual arrests but said hundreds of suspects were detained, and those deemed uninvolved with terrorism were released within days. But as in Gaza, where health officials say more than 25,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks, Israel has been accused by the U. N. and human rights groups of collective punishment in the West Bank. Since 1967, its approximately 3 million residents have lived behind barbed wire and barriers, under Israeli occupation and martial law. ""They broke my front door at two o'clock in the morning, screaming about Hamas, and beat me in front of my children,"" says Ashraf Jaradat, 40, whose shoe store about a block from the Freedom Theatre was destroyed in the same December raid. ""I was blindfolded, naked. They beat me while interrogating me. ""He showed NPR the damage to his front door, where he says a soldier used the butt of a rifle to break in. Jaradat says he was released without charge after three days. His son, arrested with him, remains in Israeli custody, he says. An Israeli military spokesperson declined to comment on their case. In a report published last month, the U. N. high commissioner for human rights said it has documented ""mass arbitrary arrests, detentions and reported torture and other ill-treatment by [Israeli forces], raising concerns of collective punishment. ""The arrests, the U. N. says, are regularly accompanied by ""physical and psychological abuse and humiliation of detainees. ""Since Oct. 7, Israeli bulldozers have been rolling into the Jenin camp almost nightly. They've torn up asphalt roads, severed electricity lines and punctured sewage pipes. In front of Jaradat's house, there's a roughly 10-foot-wide crater, pooling with raw sewage. He says he's left without an income since his shop was destroyed. ""I'm a broken man,"" he says. Jaradat admits two of his adult nephews are members of what he calls the armed resistance against Israel, and have been in Israeli prison since last year. But he distanced himself from them. ""There are about 20 armed men in this refugee camp where we are,"" Jaradat says, gesturing to the houses around his. ""How can you punish the other 20,000 of us for their actions?""When Israeli troops retreated from the Freedom Theatre on Dec. 13 after an all-night raid, staff found the facility in shambles. Trophies from drama festivals in Turkey and Japan were still strewn across broken shelves littered with glass shards when NPR visited in mid-January. Framed black-and-white photographs of Palestinian children were smashed, but a portrait of Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin still hung on one wall, next to a bumper sticker reading ""I ♥ Palestine. ""In the back of the theater, on a white wall where films are normally screened, a star of David was spray-painted in bright red. Another, in black paint, was scrawled across an Arabic and English poster outside the theater's front gate, advertising a feminist drama festival. Staff say the graffiti was left behind by Israeli soldiers. They also defaced memorial posters for local residents killed in Israeli-Palestinian fighting, neighbors say. An Israeli military spokesperson confirmed that troops entered the Freedom Theatre on the night of Dec. 12-13, and said the raid was part of ""counterterrorism activity"" in the surrounding refugee camp. The spokesperson would not comment on individual cases, but said hundreds of suspects were detained, and that those deemed uninvolved with terrorism were released within days. As for the graffiti, the spokesperson referred NPR to previous statements by military brass prohibiting vandalism by soldiers. In Gaza, Israeli commanders reportedly forced at least one group of soldiers to erase or paint over their graffiti. In Jenin, some residents have tried to scrub out the graffiti. In one spot, they spray-painted the word ""Palestine"" in Arabic, and two hearts next to a star of David. This theater is no stranger to violence. Founded in 1987 by Arna Mer Khamis, an Israeli peace activist, the theater, then known as the Stone Theater, was destroyed in an Israeli military operation in 2002. Four years later, the late founder's son, Juliano Mer Khamis — an Israeli and Palestinian actor, director, filmmaker and activist of Jewish and Christian descent – reinvented and reopened the theater his mother had begun. But in 2011, Mer Khamis was shot dead by masked gunmen. His murder remains unsolved. The theater, led in the years since by a Palestinian team, mostly from Jenin, has flourished. It's registered as a nonprofit under the Palestinian Authority, the local governing body in the West Bank. Its work has gained global renown and support — it's also registered as a foundation in Sweden, and has an international advisory board. The Israeli raid last month drew international condemnation, with protests by Broadway actors, British playwrights and others. This winter, the theater is still holding acting workshops for children – but in a location outside the refugee camp, in the city of Jenin. Organizers have canceled performances at the theater itself. On top of damage the theater sustained directly, it's too dangerous to ask audiences to come into the camp, especially at night, with near-daily Israeli incursions. When actor Abu Joas was freed from Israeli jail in late December, he returned to an empty theater. In mid-January, when NPR visited, he stood on an empty stage, alone, his shaky voice echoing through the empty auditorium. He described how Israeli soldiers burst into his home, searched through his belongings and his phone — and how his young niece watched them haul him away. Turning back toward rows of empty seats, where audiences once watched him perform, his voice brightened. ""The first time I was here, I was scared — and I forgot my lines,"" Abu Joas recalls, laughing. ""It's a happy memory. ""He says he'd like to find a way to make art — perhaps even comedy — out of this experience. But he's unsure when, or how, he'll be able act again. ""Inshallah,"" he says, God willing, ""we will make something from this. ""NPR producer Nuha Musleh contributed to this report from Jenin.",npr_articles/article_52.txt,npr_results/article_52.txt.json

The nonprofit medical organization said in a statement on Friday that there are now few places for those who need care in Khan Younis to go. The Israeli army said on Tuesday that it had encircled Khan Younis, Gaza's second largest city, and was battling Hamas fighters. Israel intensified fighting this week and ordered the evacuation of everyone in certain neighborhoods, including the hospital. Nasser Hospital is one of the main medical facilities operating in Khan Younis. Gaza's health ministry reported on Wednesday that no one was able to enter or exit because of bombardment. The hospital was also sheltering thousands of displaced Palestinians who had escaped fighting elsewhere in Gaza. Doctors Without Borders, which also goes by its French acronym MSF, said many people including most of the hospital staff fled during the evacuation order. It said that almost 350 patients remain inside the hospital and are stuck because it's too dangerous to get out. ""These systematic attacks against health care are unacceptable and must end now so that the wounded can get the care they need,"" Guillemette Thomas, MSF's medical coordinator for Gaza and the West Bank, said in a statement. MSF described doctors feeling helpless inside the hospital as they told of dire conditions such as a lack of beds and other basic supplies. One doctor quoted by MSF said doctors were squeezing out blood from gauze and sterilizing it to be reused. Israel continues to escalate its assault in Gaza as a response to the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that killed almost 1,200 people and saw some 250 others taken hostage.

The families of the more than 130 hostages Israel says are still being held fear time is running out.

""With negotiations for the hostages' release stalled and a major Israeli military campaign underway in Gaza, it can be a struggle to stay positive. This is why Idit organized a concert for Alon. ""I have no control over Alon — what they're doing to him, when he's going to come back,"" she says. ""I have control over the things I do. This I made — this I want.

He's singing about someone trying to help their child. ""He's in big trouble, and you're in a great hurry and everything that comes along with this, the sadness and range of emotions,"" Mazig explains. Alon's father is here, as well as his brother. Some soldiers also show up — they heard the music from their base near the border and came over to listen. That's because the music isn't just playing in the community center — outside, two strings of loudspeakers are suspended from a crane, pointed toward Gaza. The sound of the music echoes over the hills, and in the distance, smoke rises from Israel's bombardment of Gaza City. Fighting has been especially intense in recent days. According to Gaza's Health Ministry, more than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel's military campaign began in October. The concert wraps up, the truck with the speakers drives away and an Israeli fighter jet rumbles overhead. Back inside, Idit Ohel says she believes her son was listening.

56,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/26/1227142760/unrwa-un-agency-gaza-hamas-employees-oct-7-attack,"TEL AVIV, Israel — The secretary-general of the United Nations has called on countries to continue funding the main agency that provides aid to Palestinians in Gaza, following allegations that some of its employees were involved in the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that killed some 1,200 people in Israel. The U. N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, fired multiple employees over the allegations. In response to the claims, several donor countries have joined the U. S. — the agency's biggest donor — in pausing funding. Speaking on Sunday, Antonio Guterres warned the UNRWA would be forced to scale back aid to more than 2 million Palestinians as soon as February if funding stops. The Gaza strip is in the grip of a severe humanitarian crisis, with a quarter of the population facing starvation. ""The abhorrent alleged acts of these staff members must have consequences,"" Guterres said in a statement. ""But the tens of thousands of men and women who work for UNRWA, many in some of the most dangerous situations for humanitarian workers, should not be penalized. The dire needs of the desperate populations they serve must be met,"" he added. Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of the U. N. agency that provides aid to Palestinian refugees, said in a statement on Friday: ""The Israeli Authorities have provided UNRWA with information about the alleged involvement of several UNRWA employees in the horrific attacks on Israel on 7 October"". ""To protect the Agency's ability to deliver humanitarian assistance, I have taken the decision to immediately terminate the contracts of these staff members and launch an investigation in order to establish the truth without delay. ""Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for ""an urgent investigation by UNRWA regarding the involvement of its employees in the terrorist events of 10/7. """"It is important that UNRWA conduct a thorough internal inspection regarding the activities of Hamas and other terrorist elements in its ranks in order to ensure that the organization's humanitarian activities are not abused,"" it said in a statement. Neither Israel nor the United Nations immediately provided further details on the allegations against the UNRWA employees. U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke on Thursday to U. N. Secretary-General António Guterres about the current allegations of U. N. workers' involvement in the Oct. 7 attack and urged a thorough and swift investigation. Twelve UNRWA employees were allegedly involved, according to the U. S. State Department, which also said it has temporarily paused additional funding for the U. N. agency ""while we review these allegations and the steps the United Nations is taking to address them. ""In his statement, UNRWA's Lazzarini called the allegations against the agency employees ""shocking. """"More than 2 million people in Gaza depend on lifesaving assistance that the Agency has been providing since the war began,"" he said. ""Anyone who betrays the fundamental values of the United Nations also betrays those whom we serve in Gaza, across the region and elsewhere around the world. ""Several countries have joined the U. S. in halting funding to the U. N. agency, including Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and Italy. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said that while the UNRWA does vital, life-saving work,"" the country will pause its disbursement of recent funding. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said in a post on social media that it suspended funding to the UNRWA, adding that it remains committed to humanitarian assistance to Palestinians as well as protecting Israel's security. Canada's international development minister Ahmed Hussen said the country had paused additional funding while UNRWA investigates the allegations. UNRWA plays a critical role in supporting Palestinians fleeing the war in Gaza. The agency estimates that up to 1. 9 million people are sheltering in or near its facilities, which include schools and aid warehouses. UNRWA also has been coordinating convoys of food and medical supplies into Gaza. Facilities run by the agency have repeatedly come under fire in the war. Most recently, on Jan. 24, a building inside UNRWA's training center in Khan Younis was struck by shells. The agency said that the building housed some 800 displaced people and that at least 13 people were killed and 56 injured in the incident. Israel's military, known as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), has denied involvement in that incident. ""After an examination of our operational systems, the IDF has currently ruled out that this incident is a result of an aerial or artillery strike by the IDF. A thorough review of the operations of the forces in the vicinity is underway,"" it said in a statement. Heavy fighting in Khan Younis has killed and wounded dozens of people in recent days, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It estimates that over 26,000 people have died in Gaza since the war began. This total includes both combatants and civilians. The ministry says the majority of those who have been killed are women and children. In a statement on Saturday, UNRWA's Lazzarini said that nine countries had suspended their funding, decisions that he said threaten the agency's humanitarian work across the region. ""It is shocking to see a suspension of funds to the Agency in reaction to allegations against a small group of staff, especially given the immediate action that UNRWA took by terminating their contracts and asking for a transparent independent investigation,"" he said.

But she said that given the deteriorating situation in Gaza, the court has jurisdiction to order measures to protect Gaza's population from further risk of genocide. Donoghue outlined the provisional measures and how each judge voted. The court voted 15-2 on the order that Israel must take all measures in its power to stop anything in relation to genocide in Gaza. By 16 votes to 1, the court voted that Israel needs to take all measures within its powers to prevent and punish those involved with inciting genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Also by a 16-1 vote, the court said that Israel must take ""immediate and effective"" measures to ensure the provision of urgently needed humanitarian aid and basic services. The court also ordered Israel to take effective measures to prevent destruction and ensure preservation of any evidence related to the charge of genocide. The court gave Israel 30 days to report back on measures taken. In a video released by his office after the court's decision, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, ""Like every country, Israel has an inherent right to defend itself. The vile attempt to deny Israel this fundamental right is blatant discrimination against the Jewish state, and it was justly rejected. . . . We will continue to do what is necessary to defend our country and defend our people. ""Before delivering the decision, Donoghue read statements from Israeli officials that she said made South Africa's case plausible. She also gave a bleak assessment of the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. ""In the Court's view, the facts and circumstances mentioned above are sufficient to conclude that at least some of the rights claimed by South Africa and for which it is seeking protection are plausible. This is the case with respect to the right of the Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts of genocide and related prohibited acts,"" the court decision said. The Palestinian Authority's Foreign Ministry issued a statement welcoming the ruling, thanking South Africa and saying, ""The ICJ judges assessed the facts and the law. They ruled in favor of humanity and international law. . . . No state is above the law. ""South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in an address, ""The Palestinian people's cries for justice have been heeded by an eminent organ of the United Nations. ""Since former President Nelson Mandela's administration, South Africa has long supported the Palestinian cause, saying it sees echoes of apartheid in the situation between the Israelis and Palestinians. ""We, as South Africans, will not be passive bystanders and watch the crimes that were visited upon us being perpetrated elsewhere,"" Ramaphosa said Friday. He noted the ICJ affirmed South Africa's right to take Israel to court, ""even though it is not a party to the conflict in Gaza. ""South Africa brought the genocide complaint to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, in December. During two days of hearings from both sides this month, South Africa asked the court to issue provisional measures that would require Israel to immediately halt its assault on Gaza. Friday's provisional order from the ICJ is not a verdict on South Africa's allegation of genocide — that judgment is not expected for years. Israel strongly denies the accusation of genocide and has called it ""baseless. ""Although the court's ruling is legally binding, it is not enforceable. ""Nobody will stop us — not The Hague,"" Netanyahu said in a speech after hearings earlier this month, before Friday's ruling. However, this order may put pressure on Israel's allies and military backers — including the U. S. , which on Friday reiterated its position that the genocide allegations are ""unfounded. ""In a statement, the State Department said, ""We have consistently made clear that Israel must take all possible steps to minimize civilian harm, increase the flow of humanitarian assistance, and address dehumanizing rhetoric. ""The statement said it noted that ""the court did not make a finding about genocide or call for a cease-fire in its ruling and that it called for the unconditional, immediate release of all hostages being held by Hamas. ""This is only the second time a state has tried to litigate a charge of genocide against another. In 2019, Gambia took Myanmar to the ICJ, accusing it of a genocide against the Rohingya. In that case, the court approved emergency measures to protect Myanmar's Muslim Rohingya minority, which Myanmar ignored. Two weeks ago, in nearly three hours of testimony, lawyers and experts on behalf of South Africa presented evidence arguing that Israel's bombardment of the Gaza strip — which has now continued for more than 100 days — has gone beyond a war on Hamas and become a war on all 2 million Palestinians besieged in the Gaza Strip. Israel's bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 26,000 people — approximately 1% of the prewar population — according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Israel's offensive is in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials. ""This killing is nothing short of destruction of Palestinian life,"" South African lawyer Adila Hassim told the court of Israel's military campaign. Hassim presented a list of alleged ""genocidal acts"" that she accused Israel of perpetrating against Palestinians in Gaza. This included what she called the ""mass"" and indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians, food blockades and the wholesale destruction of Gaza's health care system and infrastructure. Hassim said the Israeli military dropped 2,000-pound bombs onto areas declared safe by Israel, including refugee camps. As a result, she said, more than 1,800 families in Gaza have lost multiple family members and 85% of Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to flee their homes. ""It is inflicted deliberately. No one is spared, not even newborn babies. The scale of Palestinian child killings in Gaza is such that United Nations chiefs have described it as 'a graveyard for children,'"" Hassim said. ""Entire multigenerational families will be obliterated,"" Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, an Irish lawyer who is supporting South Africa's legal team, told the court. She warned that yet more children would be orphaned by what she called ""Israel's genocidal assault on the Palestinian population in Gaza. ""She said that Israel's actions in Gaza have led to the need for a new term, ""WCNSF: wounded child, no surviving family. ""Hassim told the court that ""genocides are never declared in advance"" but that Israel's actions over the past three months showed a ""systematic pattern of conduct"" that, she argued, was enough proof of genocidal intent. The South African legal team also argued that genocidal intent is shown not only in the way in which Israel has conducted its campaign in Gaza but also in comments made by Israeli officials and leaders, including Netanyahu, the prime minister. Another lawyer in the South African delegation, Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, pointed to a comment that Netanyahu made in late October, when he urged Israeli soldiers to ""remember what Amalek has done to you. "" Ngcukaitobi said that this was a reference to a biblical command calling for the destruction of an entire group. ""The destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza is articulated state policy,"" Ngcukaitobi added. Israel in turn accused South Africa of presenting a ""profoundly distorted"" view of hostilities, arguing that its view was ""barely distinguishable"" from that of Hamas. Israel presented its defense at the ICJ a day after the court heard South Africa's case. In Israel's opening statement, lawyer Tal Becker said that Hamas was to blame — directly or indirectly — for Palestinian civilian deaths. Becker called South Africa's application to the court to issue a provisional measure ordering a cease-fire an ""unconscionable request"" that ""seeks to thwart Israel's inherent right to defend itself. ""The Israeli presentation acknowledged the suffering of civilians in Gaza but insisted Israel had no genocidal intent. The high civilian death toll, Israel argued, was the consequence of Hamas waging war among noncombatants. Becker told the court that it was ""impossible to understand the armed conflict in Gaza without appreciating the nature of the threat that Israel is facing. """"If there have been acts that may be characterized as genocidal, then they have been perpetrated against Israel,"" he said, referring to the stated goal of Hamas to destroy the Jewish state.

The U. N. said 13 people were killed and 56 injured in the strike. The building, which is part of a training complex run by the U. N. agency for Palestinian refugees, also known as UNRWA, was sheltering 800 people. Nahed Tanteesh, who was displaced to the center three months ago, said he was struck under his left eye with a piece of shrapnel. He said he was on the floor playing with his 4-month-old grandchild after morning prayers when he was surprised with shooting pain. ""It felt like my head burst with a pipe and I was bleeding from the nose,"" he said. Tanteesh was evacuated to a medical facility in Rafah after leaving through a safe corridor from the center. The Israeli military said in a statement that the attack was not from an Israeli aerial or artillery strike, and that they were examining whether it could have come from Hamas. Israeli troops said on Tuesday that they had encircled Khan Younis and were battling some of Hamas' toughest fighters. Nahed Tanteesh's son, Abdullah, said they were asleep early in the morning when they were awoken suddenly by loud booms and shooting. ""For six or seven hours there was shooting and explosions, it was unbelievable,"" he told NPR. ""We were under fire for four days, praying the entire time, lying on the ground. ""Abdullah Tanteesh said that he carried his bleeding father while running around the center to look for help. He eventually brought his father to the center's administration office. ""There was a person in charge of security there, with U. N. armor, and we begged, please help us!"" he said. ""But they told us, 'We are just like you, we are trapped like you and can't go anywhere. '""He said he was able to finally leave the facility to find help through what he called a so-called safety corridor. Abdullah Tanteesh also said that he has witnessed the funeral of at least 10 people. ""I saw a woman with her head cut off, and another with insides exposed,"" he said. ""They took the bodies to a warehouse in the center, wrapped them in blankets, we prayed, and they just dug up a hole in the ground and put them all in there together. ""Thomas White, the director of the UNRWA's mission in Gaza, said in a statement on Wednesday that the deteriorating safety conditions in Khan Younis are the result of a consistent failure of international humanitarian law, and called for the hostilities to stop.",npr_articles/article_58.txt,npr_results/article_58.txt.json
59,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/26/1226691760/the-long-and-bitter-relationship-between-israels-benjamin-netanyahu-and-hamas,"In 1996, Israel faced a critical election for prime minister. The conservative candidate, Benjamin Netanyahu, was the underdog. The heavy favorite for prime minister was Shimon Peres, the dovish incumbent and the leading advocate for a peace agreement with the Palestinians. As the election approached, Hamas suicide bombers carried out several deadly attacks, killing more than 50 Israelis. Professor Nathan Brown, a Middle East expert at George Washington University, said this had a powerful impact on Israeli voters. ""Suddenly Netanyahu's message, which was, 'we can't trust the peace process,' started making an awful lot more sense,"" said Brown. Those Hamas attacks boosted Netanyahu at the polls. ""In a very narrow victory, he was elected prime minister. So there was kind of a symbiotic relationship between them,"" Brown added. After many twists and turns over the years, this tortured relationship is now playing out in the full-scale war in Gaza. ""Obviously, there is no love lost between Netanyahu and Hamas,"" said Khaled Elgindy with the Middle East Institute in Washington. They may be sworn enemies, yet they also kind of need each other. On multiple occasions, the hardline policies of one have been used to the advantage of the other. ""Hamas became useful to Netanyahu as a way to ensure that a cohesive Palestinian leadership did not emerge, and therefore there couldn't be a Palestinian state,"" said Elgindy. In turn, Hamas has never negotiated with Israel and benefits from Netanyahu's recurring security crackdowns against Palestinians, said Nathan Brown. ""When the peace process looks like it's viable, Hamas is in a bind"" he said, noting that at various times Palestinians believed the talks could lead to a Palestinian state. But, he added, when the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations break down, Hamas then goes to the Palestinian people and says, ""We told you so. ""In 1997, just a year after Netanyahu was first elected, he approved an attempt to kill Hamas leader Khalid Mishal, who was then in exile in neighboring Jordan. Israeli agents poisoned Mishal — but he survived — and the plot was exposed. Jordan's King Hussein was furious and said a peace treaty with Israel was at risk. Netanyahu's government was forced to send the antidote for the poison to Jordan to help Mishal recover. The Israeli leader also had to release Hamas' imprisoned spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin. ""That incident set the kind of tone for the relations between Netanyahu and Hamas. And things have been complicated ever since,"" said Ghaith al-Omari at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Al-Omari advised the Palestinian negotiating team back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when serious talks were taking place. Hamas, he recalled, repeatedly undermined those talks. ""Every time we would make progress in negotiations, Hamas would blow up a bus or a cafe,"" he said. There have been no serious negotiations for a long time. Hamas has controlled Gaza for 17 years, and Netanyahu has been Israel's prime minister for more than 13 of the past 15 years. This period has followed a pattern. Hamas denounces Israel's tough restrictions on Gaza, and periodically steps up attacks. Israel's military hits back, and has a term for this, says Khaled Elgindy. ""They call it 'mowing the grass,' because every now and again, you have to go in and sort of cut everything down to size,"" he said. In recent years, Netanyahu made limited concessions toward Gaza. Nearly 20,000 Palestinians were permitted to enter Israel to work. The wealthy Gulf nation of Qatar was allowed to send up to $30 million a month to Gaza. This approach was known as ""quiet for quiet. ""Ghaith al-Omari says this suited Netanyahu. It allowed Gaza to function at a minimal level. At the same time, the Israeli leader could still argue that it was impossible to negotiate with the Palestinians as long as Hamas ruled Gaza. ""While he wanted to keep Hamas weak, he had no problem keeping them in control of Gaza,"" he said. ""Hamas understood this. And until Oct. 7th, they played the game. ""Yet this game — which helped Netanyahu and Hamas stay in power — was a chronically tense standoff, not a solution. It collapsed when Hamas unleashed its massive attack on Oct. 7. Speaking to NPR in November, Netanyahu said Hamas must now be destroyed. ""Once you eliminate Hamas — and we have to eliminate Hamas — otherwise, this evil will spread,"" Netanyahu said. ""But once we defeat Hamas, we have to make sure that there's no new Hamas, no resurgence of terrorism. ""Khaled Elgindy said eliminating Hamas is unrealistic. ""At the end of the day, Israel is not going to destroy Hamas. But what sort of Hamas is left?"" he said. ""Will it be a Hamas that is more pragmatic and therefore inclined to moderate? Or will it be a more radicalized Hamas?""Meanwhile, Netanyahu's political future is in jeopardy, said Ghaith al-Omari. ""The intelligence and security and military failure of Oct. 7 all happened under his watch,"" he said. Still, he noted that the Israeli leader has been a remarkable political survivor. ""One of the jokes in Israel is that a cat has Netanyahu lives. It's impossible to write him off,"" al-Omari added. For now, Netanyahu and Hamas are locked in their bloodiest battle yet, and neither is going down without a fight.

60,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/26/1226168729/israel-gaza-war-palestinian-refugees-lebanon,"BEIRUT — In the streets of the Shatila refugee camp, late Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat's image is still painted on concrete walls. It's been 20 years since Arafat's death, and 42 years since he was expelled from Lebanon — his home in exile — along with thousands of Palestinian fighters. Most banners continue to declare loyalty to Fatah, the Palestinian political faction he founded, which is a rival to the militant group Hamas. But since war broke out between Israel and Hamas in October, residents of the Shatila refugee camp in Beirut now firmly support Hamas. The peace plan that Arafat signed in 1993 with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin seems like an improbable dream. Now with each day bringing new media images of the dead and wounded in the Gaza Strip, it's war and not peace that's on the mind of most Palestinian refugees. The streets of the camp are crammed with market stalls and motorbikes. Snarled electrical wires hang between tall concrete homes built on tiny land plots that many believed would be a temporary refugee camp for Palestinians who were forced from or fled their homes across the Lebanese border. The settlement has become painfully permanent. The camp and dozens of others in the region were established a few months after the 1948 war that led to the creation of the state of Israel. Today Shatila is also home to people from Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Bangladesh and other countries who can't go home or can't afford to live anywhere else. But the heart of this camp is Palestinian. And its scars, from the loss of their homeland in 1948 and the Shatila massacre in 1982, have been reopened by the war in Gaza. While much has changed in the camp over the decades, Palestinians cling to memories and mementos of home as an important part of identity. Down a tiny alleyway with peeling paint, Dr. Mohammad al-Khatib unlocks the door next to a handwritten sign reading ""Museum of Memories. ""The electricity comes on only a few hours a day in the camp and the windowless room is completely dark. Khatib, who is 76, lights a kerosene lamp that belonged to his grandmother, its base decorated with glass beads. ""We have returned back 100 years,"" he says, referring to the glow of the kerosene flame. Khatib was just a few months old in 1948, when everyone in his village fled to Lebanon for what they thought would be a few weeks. Seventy-five years later, he says his family home in northern Israel still stands, taken over by a Jewish Israeli family. He knows that, he says, because a relative with a Western passport went back a few years ago and knocked on the door. Khatib takes the lamp over to two wooden models of houses set on a table top. Each model is painstakingly detailed, down to the black and white checker pattern on the floor. He says they were created by an 82-year-old man who wanted to make sure he didn't forget what his grandfathers' homes looked like. In one wood and glass case in the museum, there is an ax. ""This was one of the axes that was used in the 1982 massacre,"" Khatib says. His mind often returns to the day 42 years ago when Lebanese Christian militias aligned with Israel entered the Sabra neighborhood of Beirut and the adjoining Shatila camp — slashing, stabbing and shooting hundreds of civilians. The militias were on a rampage after the assassination of then-Lebanese President-elect Bashir Gemayel, which they wrongly blamed on the PLO. A Lebanese member of a Syrian party later admitted his part in the killing and a court in Lebanon convicted him in absentia in 2017. Israel had invaded Lebanon earlier that year in what it called retaliation for attacks by the Palestine Liberation Organization. A week after, Lebanon expelled the PLO, leaving camps like Shatila unprotected. In September of that year, Israel let the militias into Shatila and sealed off the camp. An Israeli commission later found Israel ""indirectly"" responsible for the massacre. Estimates for casualties in the massacre vary. A Lebanese historian conducting field work after the massacre identified 906 dead and 484 missing in field work after the massacre. The United Nations General Assembly termed it an act of genocide. Khatib, who studied medicine in Lebanon and Spain, says he was on duty at a U. N. hospital in the camp when the massacre began. ""Orabi was an Egyptian who worked at the hospital. He said to me, 'Today we will all be killed,' "" Khatib says. He says he later saw his friend's body — he had been shot in the face and in the liver. Khatib says once most Palestinians believed they could regain their homeland and live in peace with Israel, but now Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows not to allow the creation of a Palestinian state. ""So what do you think when a Palestinian hears that, when the Palestinians see the massacres that are now happening in Gaza?"" Khatib says. He says there's renewed hope of a Palestinian state, but not through peace talks — through force. It's a sentiment heard throughout the camp. While the massacre faded into memory, the media images of children being killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza are relentless. Gaza's Health Ministry says Israel's bombardment of the territory has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians, including more than 10,000 children. Israeli leaders say the aim is to destroy Hamas after the militant group's Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel killed 1,200 people and took 240 hostages back to Gaza. Near a crowded vegetable market in Shatila, a simple granite monument rests in a field containing a mass grave for massacre victims in 1982 — those who couldn't be identified or had no relatives to bury them. The parents and younger sister of the monument's caretaker, Adnan al-Maqdad, were among the victims. Maqdad has just been watching news of the Gaza war on a battery-powered TV in a tent. ""A truce is difficult now,"" he says. ""But the war will continue until liberation. ""At a shop selling small toys, the owner, Nohad Ma'rouf, says she has to believe that the killing of children in Gaza will result in a Palestinian homeland through ""determination, fighting, war and faith. ""She says even people in the camp who didn't support the militant Palestinian group that rules Gaza before, do now. ""Everyone is now Hamas. They have the right to fight — to enter Israel,"" she says, referring to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack. ""For 17 years, they have been besieged. ""Down the street, a former PLO fighter, 67, with a black-and-white scarf, known as a keffiyeh, around his neck, sits on a plastic chair in front of a shop. He won't give his name because he's afraid Israel could hunt him down. He says he witnessed the 1982 massacre and survived by hiding in the trees. But somehow, he says, seeing children killed in Gaza on television is worse. He, too, is convinced his homeland will be regained soon by force. ""How? I'll tell you how — with the determination of the youth and their faith in God,"" he says. After 75 years of despair, people here believe the war in Gaza, no matter how bloody, could be a path home.

61,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/26/1226977365/israel-idf-gaza-middle-east-deaths,"Israeli soldiers have been killed in airstrikes by Israeli planes and by shrapnel from their own explosives. Some were run over by Israeli armored vehicles or mistakenly identified and hit by tank fire, shelling and guns, according to a report released by the IDF earlier this month. Nearly a fifth of Israeli fatalities since the invasion of Gaza in late October were caused by friendly fire or accidents, accounting for 36 of the 188 soldiers killed at the time of the report. Experts say it's one of the highest such percentages in recent military history. There have been injuries, too, which are not included in the report, as Israel fights its most complex war, with two million Palestinians and tens of thousands of soldiers packed into the tiny coastal enclave of Gaza. Military experts say there are several factors as to why the number of such incidents has been high. First is the reality of urban combat in a highly dense area like Gaza. ""There's really no limit to the procedural steps that you can take to minimize those kinds of casualties. And even with that, there are going to be breakdowns, miscommunication and tragic outcomes as a result,"" said retired U. S. Lieutenant General Sean MacFarland. MacFarland was a brigade commander during the Iraq war and also commanded the coalition forces against ISIS. Battles in Ramadi, Fallujah and later Mosul are said to most resemble war conditions in Gaza.   ""What we were able to do in Fallujah and some other places is at least a partial evacuation of the city before the attack began,"" he said. That helped minimize friendly fire incidents as well as civilian casualties. But Israel is essentially fighting it out amongst the civilian population who have not been allowed to leave Gaza by Israel and Egypt. While Israel has used leaflets dropped from planes as a way to warn civilians to leave areas, critics say it hasn't been very effective. Avner Gvaryahu, who is the executive director of Breaking the Silence, an organization of Israeli veterans who oppose the occupation of Palestinian territories, said it showed signs of a policy of ""very loose rules of engagement. ""  ""We see that when you treat an area like a free-fire zone, then you definitely might have civilian casualties. You definitely might have friendly fire cases. And as we saw, you definitely might have cases of shooting and killing hostages,"" he said. The low quality of buildings in Gaza, which had been under an Israeli blockade for 16 years that made it difficult to import construction materials, have also created a 360-degree type of fight.  ""It's very easy with modern weapons to shoot right through walls that you think are potentially going to stop a round. But it will travel through the building and beyond. And in an urban environment like that, it really lends itself to friendly casualties,"" MacFarland said. And as Hamas militants jump out of the hundreds of miles of tunnel networks and fire at Israeli soldiers who are tense and ready to squeeze a trigger, it has all led to a highly kinetic environment that has tested Israel's military structure and the limits of its technological prowess. ""Urban combat really strips away a lot of the technological advantages that any force holds over any other force. Fighting inside of buildings is very, very difficult,"" MacFarland said. ""It kind of comes back to training and less about technology. ""Israel brought nearly 300,000 reservists back to active duty — many of whom went from their regular day jobs to urban combat in Gaza with very limited training — as Israeli officials rushed to respond to the October 7 attacks by Hamas. And there's more to it than the environment of urban warfare or lack of training, according to Rafael Cohen, a senior political scientist with the Rand Corporation. It also has to do with the unique structure of the IDF, a draft military. Most of the soldiers fighting in Gaza are in their late teens to mid-20s, and because Israel tends to promote quickly, there are very young people in more senior positions. ""If you also look at who Israel is losing in Gaza, they've lost a lot of junior officers. So, lieutenants, captains, majors and senior non-commissioned officers. And if you begin losing senior leaders out of tactical units, that also increases the risk of friendly fire incidents,"" Cohen said. These incidents, along with the shooting of three hostages by Israeli soldiers — and the more than 25,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza — have raised questions about how Israel is conducting its war tactically and strategically. U. S. officials have been urging Israeli leaders to be slower and more restrained and methodical in Gaza, suggestions that haven't been acted upon, according to Cohen, because it's fundamentally antithetical to how the IDF functions. ""Israeli military culture tends to be very sort of short term and tactical,"" Cohen said. Which means that the priority is generally on military force. Israel still has no ""day after"" plan in Gaza, which has also worried U. S. officials who fear that Israel could be headed toward strategic defeat. And beyond that, there's also a lack of shorter-term tactical strategy, according to Cohen, such as helping to pass out aid and food to civilians, even toys to children — something that's been drilled into American military officers. ""Thinking of what we can do to mitigate the harm to civilians both for moral grounds, but for security grounds as well,"" Cohen said. ""Because hopefully that kid you gave the soccer ball to, they'll probably still hate you, but maybe they'll hate you a little bit less is what you're aiming for. And that's just not there. ""As Israeli military leaders signaled they will keep fighting in Gaza through 2024, Cohen expects to see policy shifts that may translate into more careful behavior on the ground, as time passes from October 7 and with it, the emotional sense of failure, anger and revenge that it brought to Israeli forces. ""We'll see an increasingly thoughtful military operation that started off in clearly defined ham-fisted ways. And it's sort of been ratcheted back somewhat,"" Cohen said. And as more Israelis grow frustrated with the lack of results from the military invasion of Gaza, with at least 100 hostages remaining and 210 soldiers killed overall, Avner Gvaryahu says Israel's leaders need to learn some lessons here. In particular, that in the nearly three months since Israel's invasion of Gaza, only one hostage was returned by the military — the others were brought back through a deal. ""I think that that does expose some of the weakness in this idea that we can just use force to solve our problems,"" he said. ",npr_articles/article_61.txt,npr_results/article_61.txt.json
62,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/24/1226562873/palestinian-soccer-team-advances-asian-cup,"TEL AVIV, Israel — There were tears of joy on the soccer field Tuesday as the Palestinian national team beat Hong Kong 3-0 in the AFC Asian Cup. The team made history as it secured its place in the knockout stages of the tournament for the first time. The Asian Cup — hosted in Doha, Qatar, this year — is the top soccer event in the region. The stadium erupted with joy, chanting ""Palestine! Palestine!"" and waving Palestinian flags and keffiyehs. The win is a bright spot during a difficult time as the Israel-Hamas war rages in Gaza. Gaza's health ministry has said Israel's assault has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians, the majority of which are women and children. It has been a reaction to the Oct. 7 attack in Israel in which Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and kidnapped roughly 250 others. In the West Bank city of Ramallah, coffee shops were packed with people watching the match for the first time since the beginning of the war, and the atmosphere was festive. Waleed Abdullah said he celebrated the win with his son at a café. ""We were so happy and the result was incredible,"" he said. ""The Palestinian people need hope, want something to be happy about, to feel alive, to want to love life. ""Mohamed Aweida from Jerusalem watched the match with his friends and said the win was an incredible accomplishment. ""I've had no appetite to do anything [enjoyable] lately,"" he said. ""But this is our national team, and I had to support it. ""Like around much of the Middle East, soccer is a favorite pastime among Palestinians. But it has never been easy for the team.

""I used to make 450 shekels a day,"" he says — about $130 at the time. But after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7 and Israel began its assault on Gaza, Qatanani fled to the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He says he hasn't been able to find decent-paying work since. ""Maybe I get a job once a week to wash stairs, to wash windows — that's how I survive,"" says Qatanani, 41, who has a family back in Gaza. Now he makes about $40 a day — when he can find work. More than three months into Israel's war in Gaza, the economy of the West Bank is reeling. Many fear the economic pain could lead to even more violence in the territory, which is a bit smaller than Delaware and home to some 3 million Palestinians. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, which Israel says killed about 1,200 people, Israel banned some 100,000 Palestinian laborers in the West Bank from crossing the border to work in Israel. The country cited security concerns. This has been a huge financial blow to the West Bank. Wages of cross-border workers account for $5. 5 billion a year, about one-third of the combined economy of the West Bank and Gaza, according to the World Bank. In addition, Israel and the Palestinian Authority are in a dispute over tax money that Israel collects for the West Bank and Gaza. As a result, the Palestinian Authority, which oversees parts of the West Bank, has had to cut the wages of its 143,000 workers. They received no pay in October, half-pay in November and close to 80% in December, says Manal Farhan, the Palestinian Authority's deputy minister for the national economy. ""This time, it's the worst,"" says Farhan, ""the worst hit for our economy since the establishment of the Palestinian Authority. ""The Palestinian Authority was established in 1994. Stroll through the streets of Ramallah these days, and the war's economic impact seems to be everywhere. Baha Tamimi, who runs a gold shop in the heart of the city, says 4 out of 5 people who visit now don't want to buy gold — they want to sell it. ""A woman took off her wedding ring to help her husband pay the bills and buy vegetables — this happened right in front of me,"" Tamimi recalls, as video of people pulling bodies from the rubble in Gaza plays on the shop's TV. More than 25,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel invaded Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry. Nearby, Joudeh Said is cutting a piece of wood in his carpentry shop. He says he has one or two jobs these days, but no one has much money to pay. ""They give me a check, and then the check bounces, and then I have to chase them,"" he says. Since the war began, Said says, customers owe him $32,000, which is a lot of money in the West Bank. Per capita gross domestic product in the territory is just $4,500 a year, according to the World Bank. Across the border in Israel, it is nearly $55,000. In addition to the economic impact that the war in Gaza is having, Israeli soldiers are killing more and more Palestinians in the West Bank. The United Nations says the Israeli military has killed about 350 people in the West Bank since Oct. 7. The Israelis say they are rooting out militants. Samir Anati, who co-owns the carpentry shop, says if the economy continues to slide, violence will only grow. ""For sure,"" he says. ""I have children to feed. What can I do? I work now and get them food. I may not be able to tomorrow. """"So it is not me who will go for an intifada,"" or uprising, Anati continues. ""My children will. ""Samir Hulileh, a leading economist and businessman, worries about the impact on public workers if they are not paid. He's especially concerned about the Palestinian Authority maintaining the loyalty of its security forces, who are supposed to maintain law and order in the areas that the Palestinian Authority oversees. ""You are telling people who have their Kalashnikovs with them, 'I will not spend money on you,'"" warns Hulileh, who adds that other groups, including Hamas, could recruit them. ""You are opening up your security forces in the West Bank for options. ""Khalil Shikaki, an academic and pollster who runs the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah, is not as concerned about the security forces. But he does worry that the West Bank's battered economy is just one more ingredient in an already combustible brew. Shikaki notes that since the start of the war, Hamas' popularity in the West Bank has more than tripled — from 12% to 42%, according to his polls. In addition, some Israeli settlers in the West Bank continue to attack Palestinians, and an increasing number of Palestinians feel they have no diplomatic alternative to violence. ""The West Bank is currently boiling,"" says Shikaki, ""just waiting for the spark that could eventually lead to a major explosion.

64,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/24/1226533568/us-iraq-militia-sites-missiles-yemen,"WASHINGTON — The U. S. military struck three facilities in Iraq and two anti-ship missiles in Yemen operated by Iranian-backed militias that have continued to instigate attacks on U. S. personnel and ships in the region as the U. S. continues to try to keep the Israel-Hamas war from spilling over into a wider conflict. Both the strikes in Iraq and Yemen targeted sites that the U. S. has said are involved in the attacks against U. S. forces in Iraq and Syria and were threatening U. S. military and commercial vessels in the Red Sea. In a statement Tuesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the strikes in Iraq were at the direction of President Joe Biden and targeted facilities used by the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia group and other Iran-affiliated groups in Iraq. ""These precision strikes are in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks against U. S. and Coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-sponsored militias,"" Austin said. Those strikes hit militia facilities in Jurf al-Sakhar, which is south of Baghdad, al-Qaim and another unnamed site in western Iraq, two U. S. officials said. Late Tuesday, U. S. Central Command announced it had also struck two Houthi anti-ship missiles that were aimed into the Southern Red Sea and were prepared to launch. ""U. S. forces identified the missiles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and determined that they presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the U. S. Navy ships in the region,"" Central Command said. Both fronts — land attacks in Iraq and Syria, and sea attacks originating from Yemen — have seen a significant uptick in launches and counterstrikes over the last few days. In Iraq, U. S. strikes on the Kataib Hezbollah sites came hours after the U. S. said militants fired two one-way attack drones at al-Asad Air Base, injuring U. S. service members and damaging infrastructure. And they followed the militia's most serious attack this year on the air base, when it launched multiple ballistic missiles on Saturday. U. S. Central Command said it targeted Kataib Hezbollah headquarters, storage, and training locations for rocket, missile, and one-way attack drone capabilities. In Tuesday's drone attacks against al-Asad, U. S. defenses were able to intercept the first drone but it crashed on base and the second drone hit the base, U. S. officials said. Injuries, including traumatic brain injuries and smoke inhalation, were reported to be minor. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that had not been announced publicly. Tuesday's strikes on the Houthi missile launch sites in Yemen follow a joint operation Monday night where the U. S. and U. K. used warship- and submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles and fighter jets to take out Houthi missile storage sites, drones and launchers. On both fronts, the Iranian-backed militias have employed ballistic missiles to target U. S. bases and ships, which marks an escalation, said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who specializes in Iran. The militias have typically used drones and rockets to attack. Tehran supplied Shia militias in Iraq with short-range and close-range ballistic missiles in 2019, Taleblu said, but until November's attacks they had not been used. During Saturday's larger-scale attack, multiple ballistic missiles and rockets launched by Iranian-backed militants targeted al-Asad, but most were intercepted by air defense systems there, Sabrina Singh, Pentagon spokesperson, told reporters on Monday. She said other munitions hit the base. Al-Asad is a large air base in western Iraq where U. S. troops have trained Iraqi security forces and now coordinate operations to counter the Islamic State group. Singh said Saturday's attack was a ""barrage. "" It was the first time since Nov. 20 that Iranian proxy forces in Iraq had fired ballistic missiles at U. S. bases in Iraq. A coalition of militias calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has taken credit for a number of the attacks on U. S. forces. Kataib Hezbollah is one of the groups within that umbrella organization. Iran has also supplied the Houthis with ballistic missiles, and that group is the first Iranian proxy to fire medium-range ballistic missiles and anti-ship ballistic missiles, Taleblu said. ""With Yemen, think of it as an intensification of the problem,"" Taleblu said. Saturday's ballistic missile attack on al-Asad injured four U. S. service members, all of whom have returned to duty. One Iraqi security forces member was also injured. Since the Israel-Hamas war began in early October there have been more than 151 attacks on U. S. facilities in Syria and Iraq. According to the Pentagon, two attacks took place on Monday and included multiple rockets fired at U. S. and coalition troops at Mission Support Site Euphrates in Syria and a single rocket fired at the Rumalyn Landing Zone in Syria. Neither attack resulted in casualties or damage. The U. S. struck back at the militia groups late last month, ordering a round of retaliatory strikes after three U. S. service members were injured in a drone attack in northern Iraq. Kataib Hezbollah claimed credit for the attack, carried out by a one-way attack drone. The U. S. , in response, hit three sites, destroying facilities and likely killing a number of Kataib Hezbollah militants, according to the White House at the time.",npr_articles/article_64.txt,npr_results/article_64.txt.json

Another three Israeli soldiers were killed Monday while fighting in southern Gaza, the military said, bringing the day's death toll to 24, the highest number of deaths in a single day for Israel during its war with Hamas. In total, 221 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the beginning of Israel's ground invasion of Gaza in October, according to the military. ""We share in the sorrow of their families for the heavy loss and know that the pain is unbearable,"" said Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military's chief of staff. ""On this day, we feel the great and painful cost of war, but that which we are fighting is necessary and justified. ""The deadly incident Monday afternoon occurred near the Gaza-Israel border, where a group of Israeli reservists was ""removing structures and terrorist infrastructure,"" military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a statement Tuesday. As a group of soldiers operated inside and around a pair of buildings that had been laid with explosives, militants fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a nearby tank, Hagari said. ""The explosion of the structures was most likely from explosives laid by our forces, which were about to be used for demolishing terror infrastructure and buildings in the area,"" he said. ""Simultaneously, there was an explosion that resulted in the collapse of two two-story structures, while most of the force was inside them and nearby. """"This war has a very painful and heavy price,"" Hagari added. Additional soldiers were injured in the collapse. The military wing of Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, saying its forces destroyed a building and a tank guarding the area. The conflict has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians in Gaza, health officials there say. The toll includes both combatants and civilians, the majority of whom are women and children. Calling Monday ""one of the most difficult days"" since the war began, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the military was carrying out a ""thorough inquiry"" into the incident. The news of Monday's deaths comes as sentiment in Israel about the war is shifting. A small but growing minority of Israelis are speaking out against the war, and thousands participated in a protest in Tel Aviv over the weekend calling for Netanyahu to leave office. At a funeral Tuesday in the Kiryat Shaul military cemetery outside Tel Aviv, hundreds of people stood in the pouring rain to mourn Ilay Levy, a 24-year-old captain who was killed Monday. His sister Ori, dressed in military uniform, said in her eulogy that she had enlisted in the army on Monday, hours before she learned her brother had been killed. ""Two days ago, when we spoke on the phone for the last time, you told me, 'Ori, I can't wait to see you in uniform. ' So here I am in uniform,"" she said, as her mother wept. Of the hundreds who attended the funeral, many knew Levy as a family member, friend or fellow soldier. Others had no relation but attended the funeral as a show of support for Levy's family. Opinions were split about the direction of the war, though funeralgoers were united in their grief over its cost. ""I think we are in a war of no choice,"" said Rami Sherman. ""We want to live here, to stay here. There are a lot of mistakes and problems, but our only way to survive in the crazy world of the Middle East is to stay united. ""Abigail Shir, 24, was a schoolmate of Levy's. ""On the one hand, I still think Hamas needs to be destroyed. But sometimes, I question how the war cabinet is doing, like if they make good decisions for us,"" she said. ""There is a quote in Israel that says, 'It is good to die for our country. ' I don't feel like this anymore,"" she added. ""Is it good to die for a country that's not functioning, that celebrates the hate between us?""Alon Avital contributed reporting from Tel Aviv, Israel.

66,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/23/1226265910/israel-gaza-khan-younis,"Israeli forces have intensified their offensive in Khan Younis, Gaza's second largest city. Gazan health officials said that dozens of people have been killed in the fighting, and the United Nations said a hospital was struck, cutting off access to already limited medical care. Earlier in the war between Hamas and Israel, the city swelled with thousands of displaced people from northern Gaza. People are now being forced to flee even farther south. ""The situation [in Khan Younis] is worse than you can imagine,"" Tareq, a man who fled the fighting, told NPR in Rafah on the border with Egypt. He refused to give his last name out of fear about his safety. ""There was targeted bombing and tanks, and it took us all by surprise. No one told us to leave the area, we woke up and found the tanks in front of our houses,"" he said. ""I saw dead people on the ground, and the ambulances weren't able to reach anyone to save them because of the shooting. ""The Israeli military said on Tuesday that it has encircled the city, where it says many Hamas leaders are based. The army also said that it had located and dismantled dozens of Hamas tunnels and other underground infrastructure outside Khan Younis. Juliette Touma, a spokesperson for UNRWA, the U. N. relief agency that provides aid to Palestinians, told NPR that one of its training centers in Khan Younis was struck, killing at least six people. She said the training center served as a shelter for 30,000 people. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said Israeli shelling and gunfire from drones targeted its Khan Younis headquarters, which also serves as a shelter. It said people were injured in the strikes but did not specify how many. It also said that Israeli troops had encircled their ambulance headquarters, impeding medical transport. A spokesman for the Israeli army issued a statement on X for residents of Khan Younis to evacuate a number of neighborhoods. But it's unclear how effective such messaging is as a result of the communications blackout. Israel's military also has said because of the dense civilian population in Khan Younis its operations will be ""precise. ""Zaher Sahloul, president of MedGlobal, a nonprofit organization that provides emergency health services in Gaza, said that the number of evacuees from Khan Younis during the current fighting was shocking. ""The road was full of cars where you have mattresses and luggage on top of the cars fleeing from the Khan Younis area, using all means of transportation including carriages pulled by donkeys and horses,"" he said. ""If you see the pictures of the 1948 Nakba it is the same thing, the same families, same faces, same scenes of desperation, of depression, of anxiety on the faces of children and women and elderly. "" He referred to the mass displacement of Palestinians during the establishment of Israel. While the United States said it urged Israel to scale down its offensive in Gaza, Israel has continued to strike targets, forcing Palestinians to flee. More than 85% of people in Gaza have been forced out of their homes, according to the United Nations. Gaza's health ministry said Israel's assault has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians, the majority of which are women and children. The assault is a reaction to the Oct. 7 attack in Israel during which Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and kidnapped roughly 250 others.",npr_articles/article_66.txt,npr_results/article_66.txt.json
67,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/23/1221957556/israel-schools-arabs-jews-gaza-war,"JERUSALEM — When the bell rings at Jerusalem's Hand in Hand school, you hear something that's not common in Israel: the sound of young people's voices rising together in laughter and conversation in both Hebrew and Arabic. Israeli society is largely segregated. There is no law officially mandating segregation, but the separation of Jews and Arabs — who make up 20% of Israel's population — usually begins at a young age, with separate school systems. The separation begins at kindergarten, when Jewish and Arab children are sent to different schools and experience completely separate education ""tracks"" or systems. ""Arabs go to Arab schools in their neighborhoods and Jews go to Jewish schools in the areas where they live,"" says Nour Younis, events manager for Hand in Hand. Younis, who is Palestinian, says Arabic language and Arab culture are also mostly absent from the public sphere in Israel, so Arabs tend to stay in their own circles. There are shared spaces like hospitals and banks, but Younis says it doesn't mean people have real connections. She made her first Jewish acquaintance at age 19, in college. ""We grow up with stereotypes about the other,"" she says. ""You know, 'This is the enemy, this is that, we don't know anything about each other. ' And on the first confrontation with each other, sometimes we don't even know how to talk to each other when you get to a certain age. ""Some Israelis believe the separation leads to, and perpetuates, division. And ending decades of conflict will take increased knowledge and understanding between Jews and Arabs, through mixing. That's the concept behind Hand in Hand, founded in 1998 by a group of parents who wanted their children to grow up differently. What began as two kindergarten classes in Jerusalem and Galilee has now become six campuses nationwide, with some 2,000 students. The school's eventual goal is to create a fifth track of education within the Israeli school system. Today there are four options: Arab schools and three Jewish tracks — secular, religious and ultra-Orthodox. Hand in Hand is part of the public system, but is also partially funded by private donations and student tuition to support the school's multicultural curriculum, which includes bilingual classes and the presence of a community organizer who works closely with parents. The students at Hand in Hand campuses are around 60% Arab and 40% Jewish. There is a waiting list of Arab children who would like to attend. ""Students are coming here every day to get to know each other from a very young age,"" says Efrat Meyer, the Jerusalem school's principal, who is Jewish. Meyer says Hand in Hand creates a different reality. ""In the beginning,"" she says, ""they learn very basic knowledge about each other. And as they grow up, it becomes deeper understanding of the different lives that we're living here, the different narratives that we hold. ""Among Hand in Hand's graduates are lawyers and peace advocates striving for justice and integration across Israel. ""We practice empathy and understanding and we practice sharing our feelings and our identities,"" Meyer says. ""Not separately, but together. ""The principal says it's been difficult since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks, which Israeli says killed 1,200 people, and the ongoing war that Gaza health officials say has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians. But Meyer says teachers and students have been practicing for so many years that they've developed different muscles than the rest of Israeli society. Hand in Hand is one of the only bilingual Arabic-Hebrew schools in Israel. School officials say 90% of Israeli Arabs speak Hebrew, but only around 6% of Israeli Jews speak Arabic. Students can study Arabic in middle and high school in Israel's Jewish schools, but Younis says it is not mandatory. And even if they do study it, the Arabic taught in Israel is formal, not the spoken Arabic of Palestinians, which she calls ""like a completely different language. ""Classes at Hand in Hand are taught in both languages by two native speakers in each classroom. The teachers do not duplicate lessons, but complement each other, say the administrators. Engie Wattad, the Palestinian vice principal at Hand in Hand, and Meyer are longtime colleagues and friends. Since Oct. 7, Wattad says, this school has become a rare oasis of freedom for Palestinians who say they can be harassed or worse for expressing their anguish over the war. Israel is largely focused on the plight of its hostages, soldiers and the pain of the Oct. 7 attack. And Israeli media are not showing the images of destruction and death in Gaza that much of the world is seeing. ""For our students, this is a safe place, a safe environment,"" says Wattad. ""They feel here that they have freedom of speech. That they're not afraid to say how they feel. They're not afraid to share their grief. Because they've been raised on these values of respecting one another, and being able to hold the grief of the other. ""Still, Hand In Hand remains on high alert. It has been targeted in the past. In 2014, three Jewish men were convicted of an arson attack on the school. They also spray-painted racist messages on school walls, such as ""There is no coexistence with cancer"" and ""Death to the Arabs. ""Daniel De Shalit, a civics teacher at Hand in Hand, says dual narrative history is taught here. ""That means learning about conflicts not just from one point of view, but from multiple ones,"" he says. ""To see how the same events can be shaped into different stories, and how each side could be absolutely sure they are the just one. ""The experience of teaching here has transformed him, he says. ""It changed my entire identity,"" he says. ""Because when you live and work in this way, it somehow changes who you are. It makes you more human in the way that you can see human beings, regardless of their nationality, and have empathy with them no matter what side of the conflict they are on. ""Chaim Mayer used to teach high school elsewhere, but wanted to teach younger kids in the hope of being able to shape them. He says with a laugh that his first graders ""don't hate each other, they speak nicely to each other. They are not tainted yet. ""By third grade, it's often too late, Mayer believes. ""It's not easy,"" he says of his teaching job. ""But it's the best and the only possibility to make a change in the future. Maybe it's a drop in the bucket what we're doing, but we still have to try. ""Principal Meyer says education is about hope. ""We're strengthening the shared values, the possibility for a different life here,"" she says. ""And this is something that didn't change. We all want to see a different reality here. I want to see an equal society for me and for Engie [Wattad], together. ""At pick-up time, Palestinian Morad Muna comes with his wife Raneen Muna to fetch their twin fifth-graders. The 43-year-old father remembers the fear around the first and second intifadas or Palestinian uprisings when he was growing up. He says today is worse. ""Never have we been in such a situation,"" he says. ""Never we have [been] afraid like we [are] afraid now. Never we see this demolish that [is] happening in Gaza. Never we see this number of victims — children — I mean, it's totally unbelievable. And we don't know where we are going. ""Raneen Muna believes the school is the one safe place right now for their kids, as the war is widening the gulf in Israeli society between Arabs and Jews. Naama Hochstein, also at pickup, says her three children have a different outlook than kids who attend Jewish schools. ""They are able to see that there are maybe different points of view,"" she says. ""And the fact that they grow up with Arabic from a very young age — both the language and culture — it just makes it a beautiful part of their identity and existence, instead of something they're always intimidated by.

68,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/22/1226222496/us-uk-airstrikes-houthis-yemen,"WASHINGTON — The U. S. and British militaries bombed multiple targets in eight locations used by the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen on Monday night, the second time the two allies have conducted coordinated retaliatory strikes on an array of the rebels' missile-launching capabilities. According to officials, the U. S. and U. K. used warship- and submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles and fighter jets to take out Houthi missile storage sites, drones and launchers. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a military operation, said Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands contributed to the mission, including with intelligence and surveillance. In a joint statement, the six allied nations said the strikes specifically targeted a Houthi underground storage site and locations associated with the Houthis' missile and air surveillance capabilities. They added, ""Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea, but let us reiterate our warning to Houthi leadership: we will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world's most critical waterways in the face of continued threats. ""Britain's Ministry of Defense confirmed that four Royal Air Force Typhoon jets struck ""multiple targets at two military sites in the vicinity of Sanaa airfield"" with precision-guided bombs. The strikes, said Defense Secretary Grant Shapps, were ""aimed at degrading Houthi capabilities"" and would ""deal another blow to their limited stockpiles and ability to threaten global trade. ""One senior U. S. military official told reporters the strikes dropped between 25 and 30 munitions and hit multiple targets in each location, adding that the U. S. ""observed good impacts and effects"" at all sites, including the destruction of more advanced weapons in the underground storage facility. The official said this is the first time such advanced weapons were targeted. The official also said fighter jets from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier conducted strikes, and other ships involved included the USS Gravely and USS Mason, both naval destroyers, and the USS Philippine Sea, a cruiser. The joint operation comes about 10 days after U. S. and British warships and fighter jets struck more than 60 targets in 28 locations. That was the first U. S. military response to what has been a persistent campaign of Houthi drone and missile attacks on commercial ships since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October. The Houthis' media office said in an online statement Monday that raids targeted Sanaa, Yemen's capital. And Jamal Hassan, a resident from south Sanaa, told The Associated Press that two strikes landed near his home, setting off car alarms in the street. An Associated Press journalist in Sanaa also heard aircraft flying above the skies of Sanaa overnight Monday. Al-Masirah, a Houthi-run satellite news channel, said there were raids on three areas of Sanaa: al-Dailami Air Base just north of the capital, Sarif, northeast of the city center, and al-Hafa, which is south of Sanaa. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke with President Joe Biden earlier Monday. Sunak's office said the two leaders agreed to take ""as needed, targeted military action to degrade Houthi capabilities. ""The latest barrage of allied attacks marks the eighth time the U. S. has conducted strikes on Houthi sites since Jan. 12. And it follows an almost-daily assault on Houthi missile launchers by U. S. fighter jets and ship-based Tomahawks over the past week. The rapid response missions, which officials said go after launchers that are armed and ready to fire, demonstrate the military's increasing ability to watch, detect and strike militant activities in Yemen. The chaotic wave of attacks and reprisals involving the United States, its allies and foes suggests that the retaliatory strikes haven't deterred the Houthis from their campaign against Red Sea shipping, and that the broader regional war that the U. S. has spent months trying to avoid is becoming closer to reality. For months, the Houthis have attacked ships in the region's waterways that they say are either linked to Israel or heading to Israeli ports. They say their attacks aim to end the Israeli air-and-ground offensive in the Gaza Strip that was triggered by the Palestinian militant group Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel. But any such links to the ships targeted in the rebel assaults have grown more tenuous as the attacks continue. The U. S. and allies warned of retaliation for weeks, and the White House and a host of partner nations issued a final warning on Jan. 3 to the Houthis to cease the attacks or face potential military action. That threat, however, had little noticeable effect. The Houthis continued to attack ships in the region, including at times appearing to target U. S. Navy and U. S. -owned ships, in addition to the wide range of commercial vessels. Of the eight strike missions on Yemen this month, all but the two with Britain were conducted by the U. S. military alone. Five of the latest strikes were labeled self-defense to take out missiles ready to fire. The most recent, on Saturday, struck and destroyed a Houthi anti-ship missile that was aimed into the Gulf of Aden and was prepared to launch, according to Central Command. The Biden administration has also put the Houthis back on its list of specially designated global terrorists. The sanctions that come with the formal designation are meant to sever violent extremist groups from their sources of financing, while also allowing vital humanitarian aid to continue flowing to impoverished Yemenis. U. S. defense officials have said they believe the strikes have degraded the Houthis' weapons and strike capabilities. But Biden and others have acknowledged that the rebels are well-equipped by Iran and are likely to continue the attacks. The Houthis, meanwhile, have made it clear that they have no intention of scaling back their assault. In the wake of the first U. S. and British joint attack, Hussein al-Ezzi, a Houthi official in their Foreign Ministry, said, ""America and Britain will undoubtedly have to prepare to pay a heavy price and bear all the dire consequences of this blatant aggression. ""The continued harassment of the ships has driven the U. S. and international partners to take extraordinary steps to defend them through a joint mission named Operation Prosperity Guardian, in which they provide a protective umbrella for vessels traveling the critical waterway that runs from the Suez Canal down to the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. About 400 commercial vessels transit the southern Red Sea at any given time. And the ongoing violence has prompted companies to reroute their ships, sending them around Africa through the Cape of Good Hope instead — a much longer and less efficient passage.",npr_articles/article_68.txt,npr_results/article_68.txt.json

""We extend our condolences to Chris and Gage's families, friends, and teammates during this incredibly challenging time. They were exceptional warriors, cherished teammates, and dear friends to many within the Naval Special Warfare community,"" Capt. Blake Chaney, the commander of Naval Special Warfare Group 1, said in a statement. Chambers and Ingram were both assigned to a West Coast-based Naval Special Warfare unit. Chambers, from Maryland, enlisted in the Navy in 2012. His awards and decorations included a Navy/Marine Corps Achievement Medal with Combat ""C,"" three Navy/Marine Corps Achievement Medals, an Army Achievement Medal, a Combat Action Ribbon, and other awards, the Navy said. Ingram, from Texas, enlisted in the Navy in 2019 and his awards and decorations include various personal and unit awards, the Navy said. During the operation, one of the men fell into the rough waters and a second followed in attempt to rescue him, as NPR previously reported. Search and rescue operations concluded on Sunday, U. S. Central Command said, with the two SEALs presumed dead. It came after a 10-day search of more than 21,000 square miles, with assistance from Spain and Japan. Efforts have now switched to recovery, CENTCOM said. The Navy said the incident is still under investigation. U. S. Army Gen. Michael ""Erik"" Kurilla, who heads Central Command, said in a statement on Sunday: ""We mourn the loss of our two Naval Special Warfare warriors, and we will forever honor their sacrifice and example. Our prayers are with the SEALs' families, friends, the U. S. Navy, and the entire Special Operations community during this time.

The war's deaths, destruction and displacement are without precedent in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The war has divided Israelis while the offensive threatens to ignite a wider conflict involving Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen that support the Palestinians. Furious with the Israeli government and demanding the release of remaining hostages, relatives and others set up a tent camp outside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem and vowed to stay until a deal is reached. Netanyahu, in a defiant new statement, said he stressed in his conversation Friday with U. S. President Joe Biden that he rejects Hamas demands for a cease-fire, Israeli forces' withdrawal and the release of Palestinians held by Israel in exchange for the remaining hostages. He said that agreeing means another devastating Hamas attack ""would only be a matter of time. ""Netanyahu also rejects calls from U. S, its closest ally, for postwar plans that would include a path to Palestinian statehood. U. N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the refusal to accept a two-state solution unacceptable. ""The Middle East is a tinderbox. We must do all we can to prevent conflict igniting across the region,"" Guterres added. ""And that starts with an immediate humanitarian cease-fire to relieve the suffering in Gaza. ""The war began with Hamas' attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7. Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 hostages back to Gaza. Israel's military announced the death of 19-year-old Sgt. Shay Levinson, who was among the hostages. His date of death was given as Oct. 7, but there were no further details. According to Israeli media, his body is still in Gaza. Israel has responded to the Oct. 7 attack with a bombing campaign and ground invasion that laid waste to entire neighborhoods in northern Gaza and spread south, striking some areas where it told civilians to seek refuge. Ground operations are now focused on the southern city of Khan Younis and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. ""The plumes of smoke from tanks, artillery and the planes of the air force will continue to cover the sky over the Gaza Strip until we will achieve our goals,"" Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said. Since the war started, 25,105 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, while another 62,681 have been wounded, the Health Ministry said. The toll included the 178 bodies brought to Gaza's hospitals since Saturday, Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said. The overall toll is thought to be higher because many casualties remain buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot reach, Al-Qidra said. The Health Ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its figures but says about two-thirds of the people killed in Gaza were women and minors. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, but its casualty figures from previous wars were largely consistent with those of U. N. agencies and even the Israeli military. The Israeli military says it has killed around 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and other militant infrastructure in dense neighborhoods. The military released footage of a tunnel under a residential neighborhood in Khan Younis where the army believes at least 20 hostages were kept at different times. Israel's military said the demolition last week of a key building at Israa University in Gaza was under review, and asserted that preliminary findings indicated Hamas had used the compound for military purposes. The university has said the ""attack"" came weeks after Israeli forces occupied the building. The war has displaced some 85% of Gaza's residents, with hundreds of thousands packing U. N. -run shelters and camps in the south. U. N. officials say a quarter of the population of 2. 3 million is starving as a trickle of humanitarian aid reaches them because of the fighting and Israeli restrictions. Israel said 260 trucks of aid entered Gaza on Sunday, the highest number since the war began. About 500 entered daily before that, according to the U. N. ""Bread does not suffice for one hour,"" said Ahmad Al-Nashawi, who accepted donated food at a tent camp in the southern city of Rafah. ""You can see how many children we have other than women and men. What matters most for a child is to eat. ""At the new protest camp outside Netanyahu's Jerusalem residence, hostages' families urged the government to act. ""It's not logical that you're telling us the war must continue, and you keep saying that because of military pressure we will release them, but we don't see a single one released because of this pressure,"" said Gilad Korengold, the father of hostage Tal Shoham. Some top Israeli officials have begun to acknowledge that Netanyahu's goals of ""complete victory"" over Hamas and returning the remaining hostages might be mutually exclusive. A member of Israel's War Cabinet, former army chief Gadi Eisenkot, said last week that the only way to free the hostages was through a cease-fire. But Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners push him to step up the offensive, with some calling for the ""voluntary"" emigration of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and the re-establishment of Jewish settlements there. Hamas is believed to be using the hostages as shields for its top leaders. Israel has rescued one hostage, and Hamas says several have been killed in Israeli airstrikes or during failed rescue operations. Hostages' families want an exchange like the one during a weeklong November cease-fire. Other Israelis are frustrated by the security failures ahead of the Oct. 7 attack and by Netanyahu's handling of the war. Near the site of an Oct. 7 massacre during a music festival, families of Israeli victims planted trees. ""What happened after 109 days? Nothing. We're just still waiting,"" said one father, Idan Bahat.",npr_articles/article_71.txt,npr_results/article_71.txt.json

S. service members and at least one Iraqi service member suffered injuries in an attack by Iranian-backed militants on an air base in western Iraq, U. S. officials said. A barrage of missiles and rockets targeted the Ain al-Asad base on Saturday evening, U. S. Central Command said in a statement. Most of the missiles were intercepted by the base's air defense systems, according to the military, but an untold number hit the base where Americans and Iraqis are stationed. A damage assessment is ongoing. A ""number"" of U. S. personnel are being evaluated for traumatic brain injuries, CENTCOM said, without specifying how many. Last month, three U. S. service members were wounded, one critically, in a drone attack on their base in northern Iraq. The U. S. responded with airstrikes that it said destroyed facilities and likely killed a number of Kataib Hezbollah militants in Iraq. It's the latest in a series of back-and-forth attacks between Iran-aligned groups and U. S. forces in the region since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel that led to the deadly war in Gaza. Since then, the U. S. has issued warnings of a wider war in the region. Hamas is part of a regional alliance supported by Iran and loosely united by their resistance to Western powers and Israel.

73,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/20/1225795279/gaza-israel-flour-port-aid,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel will allow shipments of flour to Gaza to arrive via a port in the Israeli city of Ashdod, a development that aid groups have called for to alleviate food shortages in the embattled territory. The White House announced Israel's decision Friday after a phone call between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""The president welcomed the decision from the Government of Israel to permit the shipment of flour for the Palestinian people directly through Ashdod port,"" the White House said afterward. Israel has not publicly announced the deal. Netanyahu's office Saturday released a one-sentence statement about the call that only described Netanyahu's demand that Israel retain ""security control"" over Gaza after the war is over — a demand incompatible with Biden's push for a Palestinian state. An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, confirmed news of the port deal to NPR, and added that millions of dollars worth of flour is expected to be shipped in over time. The port of Ashdod, one of the two largest commercial ports in Israel, is located on the coast about 20 miles north of Gaza. The White House did not publicize other details about the shipments, such as when they would begin or where the flour would cross into Gaza after arriving in Ashdod. The announcement came four days after the heads of the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization and UNICEF, the U. N. agency for children, had called on Israel to authorize the use of the port to ship in greater amounts of humanitarian assistance. Opening the Ashdod port to humanitarian shipments ""would enable significantly larger quantities of aid to be shipped in and then trucked directly to the badly affected northern regions of Gaza, which few convoys have managed to reach,"" the agency heads wrote in a statement. In its readout of the Biden-Netanyahu call, the White House said its teams would continue to ""separately work on options for more direct maritime delivery of assistance into Gaza. "" Food assistance, including flour, arrives daily to southern Gaza via the border crossings at Rafah and Kerem Shalom. But aid groups say much more flour is needed, including in northern Gaza, which is mostly inaccessible from the south due to fighting and damaged roads. For many Palestinians in Gaza, each day has become a struggle to find basic necessities, like clean water and food to eat. Flour, especially, is in demand to make bread. ""Nowadays, what keeps us alive is just bread, flour, tuna and water,"" said Mohammed Abu Hashem, 28, who is living in a tent in Rafah after fleeing the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. ""If any of these are cut off or missing, it's a big problem for any family. ""A day's labor earns him about 20 shekels, or about $5, he said. ""Today, 20 shekels can't buy a loaf of bread or anything. ""A 25-kilogram bag of flour that might have cost $10 before the war now costs 200 shekels, or more than $50, he said. ""Who has 200 shekels?"" he asked. The firewood or fuel needed to heat a pan for bread is also expensive, Abu Hashem added. Unable to make their own bread, Nu'man Kabaja, 30, a Palestinian displaced from the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, said he and his wife regularly stand in line for six or more hours to buy bread from a bakery to feed their five children. ""We stand for these six hours. We buy the bread. We burn our day to feed our children,"" Kabaja said. ""My children are hungry, and my wife is hungry. We are all hungry. ""Only 15 bakeries are operational across southern Gaza, and none are operating in the north, the World Food Programme reports. Palestinians have described extremely long lines at aid stations and high prices at informal markets. The U. N. warns that Gaza's entire population of 2. 2 million is at imminent risk of famine. Nearly 380,000 Palestinians in Gaza are currently at catastrophic levels of food insecurity, the U. N. says, meaning they are experiencing an extreme lack of food despite exhausting all coping mechanisms.

74,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/20/1225716149/houthis-yemen-redsea-ships-israel-hamas,"An upsurge in attacks on commercial ships by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in the Red Sea threatens to disrupt the global supply chain as vessels are forced to reroute around Africa to avoid the conflict zone. Normally, about 15% of the world's trade passes through the Red Sea, and delays and escalating insurance costs are hitting industries such as petroleum, food and electronics. Manufacturers have already experienced some problems in getting parts to assembly floors, and both Tesla and Volvo last week blamed the Red Sea troubles for delays at plants in Europe. But shipping industry experts hope lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Suez Canal disruption in 2021 and Somali pirate attacks more than a decade ago will help mitigate widespread problems this time, should the conflict widen in the Red Sea. Since October, the Houthis have targeted several ships on the Red Sea with ballistic missiles and drones and have hijacked others near the entrance to the vital corridor at the Bab-el-Mandeb strait. The Houthis have said their attacks are in response to Israel's air and ground assault on Gaza, which has killed nearly 25,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The military campaign in Gaza followed the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that Israel says killed 1,200 people. The U. S. , leading a maritime coalition involving more than 20 countries, according to the Defense Department, has launched airstrikes against the Houthis to secure the waterway. Supply chain disruptions are nothing new for the shipping industry. The COVID-19 pandemic presented an unprecedented challenge for the industry — with vessels stuck at ports waiting to load goods even as freight rates skyrocketed from a lack of capacity and quarantined consumers ordered everything online. Also in the Red Sea, the giant Ever Given container vessel became lodged in the Suez Canal in 2021, halting all traffic through that vital area for nearly a week. And more than a decade ago, Somali piracy was a major concern for shippers as well. The Houthis present a more serious challenge, says Munro Anderson, head of operations at Vessel Protect, which specializes in marine war risk insurance. ""It's unfortunately quite difficult to mitigate against drones, drone strikes, water-borne IEDs [improvised explosive devices] and things like that. So a number of the major lines have obviously decided to discontinue transits through the Red Sea and take the longer route. ""So, what has the industry learned from these frequent disruptions that could contain the impact this time around?The supply chain issues associated with COVID-19 did not come all at once. In fact, they reverberated in successive waves as the pandemic appeared to wax and wane over time. The pandemic, for example, made it difficult for automobile manufacturers to get parts to build cars. Lumber prices also skyrocketed as transportation networks were impaired by COVID-19 just as pandemic-related home renovations became more popular. However, most experts believe the current situation won't be nearly as disruptive in the long run, although some think it could be months before the Houthi threat is eliminated. Lisa Anderson, a supply chain expert and president of California-based LMA Consulting Group, says that in the past, shippers, vessel operators and manufacturers may have waited too long to properly evaluate an emerging threat such as COVID-19 or the Houthis, when taking action sooner would have been prudent. This time around, companies seem to be moving more quickly, Anderson says. For example, Denmark-based Maersk and Germany's Hapag-Lloyd — two of the world's largest container lines — have already decided to reroute around South Africa to protect their crews, ships and cargo. ""We have to become comfortable with uncertainty,"" Anderson says. ""No one wants to be, but that's the world we're living in. ""Lars Jensen, CEO of Vespucci Maritime in Copenhagen, Denmark, says anticipating how a situation such as the Houthi threat will play out weeks and even months down the road is important for customers — those contracting to move goods and the shippers themselves. That extends to how costs will be passed on to consumers. ""It's the ability . . . to be able to sit down when you have some of these supply chain disruptions and not look at the immediate present, but to say, 'Well, what [kind of] domino effect will this cause three, four or five or six weeks down the line?'"" Jensen says. Lisa Anderson, who advises companies on supply chain management issues, says when a crisis such as the current one in the Red Sea arises, ""You need to be asking, 'What are some backup plans that I can be putting in place now? Should I develop a relationship with additional suppliers? Should I find alternate routes? How much will it cost me to fly critical goods, let's say, or critical items to key customers or key manufacturers to keep their production going?'""Some of those answers will be different depending on who is operating the ship, which country's flag the vessel flies, how old the ship is and what it's carrying, says Vessel Protect's Munro Anderson. In the case of the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, initially vessels with an Israeli affiliation were targeted. In recent weeks, U. S. -flagged ships and vessels affiliated with other nationalities have been targeted. ""There is definitely a waning appetite for underwriting risks in the Red Sea,"" Munro Anderson says. He says that for large ship owners and operators such as Maersk, ""I'd be fairly comfortable in saying that the risk to life at sea is probably the number one guiding principle. ""Experts say it costs shippers an additional $1 million each way and nine to 12 more days at sea each way to travel the longer route around South Africa's Cape of Good Hope. That compares with $1 million to $1. 5 million more for insurance to transit the Red Sea right now. But ""a good benchmark"" for the value of a large container ship plus its cargo is about $1 billion, says Jensen, meaning that the additional costs for an ""around Africa"" route, while not insignificant, are worth it to avoid the risk of going through the Red Sea right now. In fact, Egypt, which operates the Suez Canal, the northern terminus of the Red Sea route, reports a sharp drop in revenue from transit fees in recent weeks. The Suez Canal Authority's chairman, Adm. Osama Mounier Mohamed Rabie, said last week that revenue had fallen by 40% in the first 11 days of January. Basil Karatzas, the CEO of Karatzas Marine Advisors, says that COVID-19 has caused many manufacturers to add slack to their inventories to prepare for unexpected supply chain shocks. ""Basically we have gone from a just-in-time inventory to just-in-case inventory,"" he says. Some manufacturers, stung by massive disruptions during COVID-19, have also begun ""reshoring,"" or bringing more of the process closer to consumers, LMA's Lisa Anderson says. In some cases, ""they're coming back to the U. S. , they're going to Mexico and they're going to Central and South America,"" she says. She gives one of her customers as an example: a producer of lawn and garden products that saw a surge in sales in the U. S. during COVID-19. Production was based in China, which experienced a prolonged lockdown during the pandemic. ""They ended up moving the bulk of their production to Mexico,"" she says. Jensen acknowledges that some additional inventory and reshoring has been built into supply chains, but that without any major disruptions in 2023, ""freight rates came tumbling down actually to even below pre-COVID levels. """"And what did all these importers do? Or at least a large part of them? They went back to just-in-time logistics,"" he says. ""So, the lessons during the pandemic that you should have a more resilient supply chain — that also went out the window last year. ""During the pandemic, when freight rates were sky-high, the container-shipping industry ordered a large number of ships to be built, Jensen says. A lot of those vessels are coming out of shipyards now. Before the Houthi trouble, that resulted in tumbling freight rates. Last year, ""they already had overcapacity,"" he says. ""And 2024 was going to have even more overcapacity. ""Jensen says that before the Houthi crisis, ""shipping lines were basically back to being loss-making"" as a result of this overcapacity. But now this may be changing, he says. ""Now we've gotten to a point where we have enough capacity, but only just,"" he says. ""That has caused freight rates to go up dramatically over the last five weeks. "" Still, he says, ""we are nowhere near the freight-rate levels we saw during the pandemic. ""As a comparison, Jensen says, ""If you look at the spot rate right now from Asia into, for example, [the] U. S. East Coast, I believe we are now looking at something to the tune of about $5,000. "" The extreme rates during the pandemic were up to five times higher, he says. Vessel Protect's Munro Anderson says it's too early to know exactly how long the disruptions will continue. ""We are still in the midst of these tit-for-tat strikes,"" he says. ""This has yet to play out. ""Instead, those vessel operators willing to brave the Red Sea will have to depend on the U. S. -led maritime coalition for protection, Karatzas says. ""But the minute you get an attack by a drone, no commercial vessel is prepared or can be prepared to address that. ""Ultimately, a military response alone will probably not be enough, says Munro Anderson. A real solution, he says, ""lies in the diplomatic resolution of the issues that are faced in that region. """"That is what the market would like to see,"" he says.",npr_articles/article_74.txt,npr_results/article_74.txt.json
75,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/20/1225168320/israel-antiwar-movement-mothers-soldiers-gaza-war,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Among the small but growing number of Israelis protesting the war in Gaza are mothers whose sons are soldiers serving there in combat. They call their new group The Mothers' Cry. Many of them do not have the heart to tell their sons they are trying to build a national movement to bring them home. About a third of a million Israeli reservist soldiers were mobilized after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack. More than 190 soldiers have been killed and more than 1,170 have been wounded since troops invaded Gaza in late October. Still, Israelis overwhelmingly support the military campaign in Gaza. The anti-war mothers initiative has received little public exposure. But they are drawing inspiration from a similar grassroots protest movement of soldiers' mothers called the Four Mothers, credited with swaying public opinion against Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon and its high soldier death toll, leading to the withdrawal of Israeli troops in 2000. ""Be a mother. You know exactly what to do,"" says Rachel Madpis Ben-Dor, a leader in the Four Mothers movement, in support of the anti-war mothers. ""You are there to save lives, as simple as that. ""The story of how Israeli math professor Michal Brody-Bareket founded the anti-war mothers group begins on the sixth day of the Gaza war. On Oct. 7, Hamas attackers invaded southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostages into Gaza, Israeli authorities say. On Oct. 12, Brody-Bareket was walking in downtown Jerusalem, holding a handwritten sign, on her way to attend the very first protest demonstration called since the beginning of the war. When she arrived, nobody was there. The police had broken up the demonstration. ""And then, policemen aggressively threw me to the ground, me and my sign,"" she says. Israelis passing by on the street called out death threats to her. What she called for on her sign — ""negotiations for the release of the hostages"" — is exactly what Israel ended up doing a month later: It negotiated with Hamas for the release of about half of the hostages. Brody-Bareket's 21-year-old son was sent with his special forces unit to fight in Gaza. He has been there for most of the war. ""In my worst dreams, I never thought of such a situation that my son will be sent inside Gaza,"" she says. ""I was climbing the walls. I was so nervous. ""His army outfit of 16 soldiers is now down to seven, she says. One was killed along the Israel-Gaza border on Oct. 7 and eight others were wounded during the ground invasion of Gaza, some by friendly fire. On a short furlough during the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, her son came home. ""He looked at me and said, 'How much do you want to hear?' So I said, 'Talk, talk to me. ' And he — he had some awful stories, but I don't want to tell them,"" she says. ""He's going to have a very big wound in his soul. ""His team killed fighters and civilians in Gaza, she says. Brody-Bareket defines herself as a radical leftist, opposed to Israel's military response to the Hamas attack. ""As if a huge massacre in Gaza can compensate the awful massacre that we had in Israel. I cannot accept it,"" she says. Brody-Bareket opened a WhatsApp chat group, with a call to pull the ground troops out of Gaza. She laid out six main arguments for their withdrawal:She invited parents from her son's army unit to join her. None responded. The group's first meeting, in a Tel Aviv park, drew seven women. Some mothers shared what their sons told them about their experiences serving in Gaza as soldiers. ""He told us that it's like Hiroshima. He's been shocked by the destruction,"" says one mother, who only gives her nickname, Tali. ""It's, like, useless. It's leading to kill our sons. This is the only thing I see. """"We want to encourage other solutions, but it feels that the majority is in such a shock after the events of Oct. 7, so they are not able,"" said Effi, another mother to a soldier, who also asked to be identified only by her nickname. Like Brody-Bareket, the two do not want their sons to know about their protest, worrying it will leave them confused on the battlefield. Yifah Sahar, whose son is serving in the military, says they had a long conversation about her anti-war activism. ""He knows, partially, about the group,"" Sahar says. ""He's not like me, calling to take the troops out of Gaza, but he does think that to get the hostages out, there has to be a cease-fire. ""The mothers discussed in their WhatsApp chat how to support their sons serving in uniform while opposing the ground invasion of Gaza. ""The message we mothers are conveying to our sons and daughters who are in the military is this: You must fulfill your role and I support you 100% as my child. And I as a mother must fulfill my role, and that is to advocate for peace,"" Sahar says. Another group of soldiers' mothers, Mothers of the Fighters, is calling for the opposite: to intensify the fight in Gaza and resist U. S. calls to scale down military operations. ""Let us win the war,"" shouted Rina Shamir into a megaphone outside a Tel Aviv hotel where U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was staying on a recent visit. Shamir's husband and son are both fighting in Gaza. ""I don't want to judge them. It's crazy,"" she said about the anti-war mothers group. ""But we're going to win. We're going to win this battle. ""Israeli police have permitted demonstrations calling for the government to act to secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza. But many vigils calling for a cease-fire or expressing sympathy for Palestinian victims in Gaza have been broken up by police, often violently. ""Anyone who wants to identify with Gaza is welcome. I will put them on buses that are heading there right now, and I will help them get there,"" said Israel's chief of police, Yaakov Shabtai, in a video in mid-October. ""In recent years, this is unprecedented. All the crackdown on freedom of expression and on freedom of protest is unprecedented,"" says Noa Sattath, director of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, which has successfully fought in court to secure permits for anti-war protests. ""In all the Gaza wars there has been nothing like this. ""The Mothers' Cry began with eight members in a WhatsApp chat and today counts several hundred members on its WhatsApp and Facebook groups. They are a modest presence in weekly street protests, which have been growing. The largest so far drew many hundreds in a march in Tel Aviv on Thursday, endorsed by a coalition of more than 20 anti-war groups, including The Mothers' Cry. ""It gives me a lot of hope,"" Brody-Bareket said at a recent demonstration. ""I am not desperate anymore. ""But she still can't bring herself to tell her own son serving in Gaza about the movement she's trying to build.",npr_articles/article_75.txt,npr_results/article_75.txt.json
76,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/20/1225748334/biden-netanyahu-two-state-solution-2024,"President Biden has long held a deep connection to the state of Israel — both personal and political. But the politics in the region under the current Israeli government — and politics at home in the base of his own Democratic party — are putting his long-held views to the test. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected calls for a Palestinian state, including during remarks this week – even as Biden and his administration push for a regional economic integration deal that would include a pathway toward a two-state solution. Meanwhile, Biden's unwavering support for Israel is running up against a generation of young voters. They are more skeptical of the Israeli government and more sympathetic to Palestinians than older Democratic voters. And that means Biden has to navigate both Netanyahu and the fractures in his own party as he seeks reelection. Biden's lifelong bond with Israel was first kindled by his dad over dinner table conversations about the Holocaust, as the president often recounts. On his first diplomatic trip to Israel in 1973, as a newly-elected senator from Delaware, Biden met then-prime minister Golda Meir — a meeting he still talks about as leaving a strong impression. He has returned to Israel many times. Former U. S. diplomat Dennis Ross remembers being at the King David hotel in Jerusalem in 2002, during the Second Intifada. The normally bustling hotel was deserted because of frequent suicide bombings. ""I came down for breakfast and the room was completely empty, except for one table, it has two people and the two people are Joe Biden and Tony Blinken,"" said Ross. He asked Biden why he was there in the midst of this ongoing violence. ""Biden said, 'This is precisely the time when I need to be,'"" Ross recalled. ""It stayed with me because it's such a reflection of his attitudes toward Israel. ""It was a message: Israel would not be isolated. It would not be alone. It would always have the United States as a friend. And that is a message Biden carries to this day. ""No other American president has the kind of experience and decades-long interaction with the people of Israel, the idea of Israel and the state of Israel,"" said Aaron David Miller, a former State Department diplomat who advised previous presidents on Middle East policy. Biden was steadfast in his support for Israel after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, which left some 1,200 Israelis dead. Another 240 people were taken hostage. Israel vowed to destroy Hamas leaders. But Palestinian civilian casualties have soared. More than 24,000 people have been killed, Gaza's health ministry said this week. Calls for a ceasefire have grown louder – including from some Democrats. But Biden has continued to support Israel's military offensive. ""People have asked me repeatedly: he's going to change at some point, right? He's going to pick up the phone, he's going to call Netanyahu and he's going to say, 'Enough. Enough already,'"" said Miller. ""My response is, 'I don't think that moment is going to happen. ' This has been an emotional gut issue for him from the beginning. ""Biden allies point out the president's support for Israel has largely reflected the will of the majority of the American public. Most Americans back Israel in the conflict, polls have shown. ""This is an issue where he feels the politics and his own gut are in the same place,"" said Jonah Blank, a former foreign policy adviser to Biden for nearly a decade in the Senate. Polls also show Democrats are split. If Biden showed more support for Palestinians, he could open himself up to more criticism ahead of the election. ""I think the president would be vulnerable politically to some conservative Democrats and certainly to the Republicans if in fact he allowed them to paint him as someone who was not sympathetic enough to what the Israelis have suffered,"" he said. Some Democrats on the left want Biden to do more to show sympathy for Palestinians who are suffering. They see Biden hugging Netanyahu and rarely criticizing him in public for the mass civilian casualties. But it's not Biden's style to call out people publicly who he is negotiating with privately, said his former adviser Blank. ""Joe Biden believes that public criticism is counterproductive and kind of humiliating,"" he said. Earlier this month, Tariq Habash, a Biden appointee in the Department of Education, resigned. The 33-year-old Palestinian American from Ohio says he could no longer work in an administration where he felt his own humanity was undervalued. Habash said he knew Biden was a strong supporter of Israel, but said he's still disappointed that the president hasn't budged. He said he is particularly frustrated because he feels like Biden has shown a willingness to evolve on policy in the past - whether it was the invasion of Iraq or abortion. ""He has changed those perspectives,"" said Habash. ""He has admitted - unlike a lot of other politicians - that you can be wrong, and learn from the past, learn from your mistakes. ""On the campaign trail, Biden has faced protesters criticizing him for his support of Israel – including during a high-profile speech earlier this month. He was asked this week whether he's concerned with losing votes over the issue. He deflected, alluding to his likely opponent, former President Donald Trump, who put in place travel restrictions for certain Muslim-majority countries. After speaking to Netanyahu on Friday – a conversation that included some discussion of post-war governance for Gaza – Biden expressed optimism that Netanyahu could eventually accept a two-state solution ""given the right one. ""The assumption from the White House and Biden allies is that the conflict will be in a very different place by the time people actually start voting. ""I think what matters is what happens next,"" said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. , co-chair of Biden's reelection campaign and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""I fully expect that there will be a change. There will be increased humanitarian aid into Gaza, there will be a dramatic change in the tempo of [Israel's] fight against Hamas in Gaza,"" he said. Coons expressed optimism about ""regional reconciliation"" – the efforts to forge peace by normalizing relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. ""If that's not possible, if that doesn't happen over the next couple of months, I do think that there's segments of the Democratic base that will be more and more concerned and disenchanted,"" Coons warned. But for now, any regional deal is contingent on moving toward a state for Palestinians — something that the Israeli prime minister has so far said he is set against, which could leave Biden in a difficult position.",npr_articles/article_76.txt,npr_results/article_76.txt.json
77,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/20/1225790904/women-and-children-are-the-main-victims-of-the-israel-hamas-war-un-says,"UNITED NATIONS — Women and children are the main victims in the Israel-Hamas war, with some 16,000 killed and an estimated two mothers losing their lives every hour since Hamas' surprise attack on Israel, the United Nations agency promoting gender equality said Friday. As a result of the more than 100-day conflict, UN Women added, at least 3,000 women may have become widows and heads of households and at least 10,000 children may have lost their fathers. In a report released Friday, the agency pointed to gender inequality and the burden on women fleeing the fighting with children and being displaced again and again. Of the territory's 2. 3 million population, it said, 1. 9 million are displaced and ""close to one million are women and girls"" seeking shelter and safety. UN Women's executive director, Sima Bahous, said this is ""a cruel inversion"" of fighting during the 15 years before the Hamas attack on Oct. 7. Previously, she said, 67% of all civilians killed in Gaza and the West Bank were men and less then 14% were women. She echoed U. N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' calls for a humanitarian cease-fire and the immediate release of all hostages taken captive in Israel on Oct. 7. ""However much we mourn the situation of the women and girls of Gaza today, we will mourn further tomorrow without unrestricted humanitarian assistance and an end to the destruction and killing,"" Bahous said in a statement accompanying the report. ""These women and girls are deprived of safety, medicine, health care, and shelter. They face imminent starvation and famine. Most of all they are deprived of hope and justice,"" she said. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says nearly 25,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, 70% of them women and children. The United Nations says more than a half million people in Gaza — a quarter of the population — are starving. In Israel, around 1,200 people were killed during the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that sparked the war, and some 250 people were taken hostage by militants. More than 100 hostages are believed to still be held captive in Gaza. Bahous said UN Women had heard ""shocking accounts of unconscionable sexual violence during the attacks"" by Hamas, and she echoed U. N. calls for accountability, justice and support for all those affected. Despite escalating hostilities in Gaza, the agency said women-led and women's rights organizations continue to operate. It found that 83% of women's organizations surveyed in the Gaza Strip are at least partially operational, mainly focusing on the emergency response to the war. But UN Women said its analysis of funding from last year's flash appeal for Gaza found that just 0. 09% of funding went directly to national or local women's rights organizations. Bahous said there is a need for much more aid to get to Gaza, especially to women and children, and for an end to the war. ""This is a time for peace,"" she said. ""We owe this to all Israeli and Palestinian women and girls. This is not their conflict. They must no longer pay its price. """,npr_articles/article_77.txt,npr_results/article_77.txt.json
78,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/19/1225651180/israel-tel-aviv-protest-gaza-war,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Omri Goren holds a stack of purple flyers that say: ""Only peace will bring security. ""He's part of a small anti-war movement in Israel calling for a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, where 2. 3 million people are struggling to survive months of Israeli bombardment and a near total siege of the territory. Goren was among a few hundred people who came out to march and protest in Tel Aviv Thursday night in support of peace. Emotions in Israel are still raw from the stunning Hamas attack on southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7 that killed 1,200 people and took about 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials. That assault set off what some conflict experts have called one of the most destructive wars in recent history. Many Israelis believe the only way to crush Hamas and secure Israel is militarily. But Goren says Israel's continued bombardment of Gaza more than 100 days since the Oct. 7 attack only serves the political interests of Hamas and Israel's far-right government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""The war is bad for Israelis and Palestinians. The war is good for the Hamas and Bibi,"" he said, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. ""They both have interests in the war, of dead people, people scared from each other. ""The anti-war protest was made up of Israeli Jews of all ages, many belonging to groups that have long called for an end to Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. ""I hope we are not the minority, I hope that most of the people want to live in peace and have a good relationship with our neighbors,"" said Avigail Arnheim, a protester in her 60s. She said she's horrified by the suffering of Gaza's children, who've borne the brunt of this war. More than 10,000 children have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. And thousands of kids have been orphaned and lost limbs from Israeli airstrikes, according to aid groups. The U. N. children's fund, UNICEF, says children there are exposed to a lethal combination of malnutrition, hunger and a spike in cases of diarrhea because of a lack of clean drinking water. Thousands face ""child wasting,"" the most life-threatening form of malnutrition due to the siege and war in Gaza. ""My people did it. My government did it,"" Arnheim said, referring to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. ""This is why I stand here. I want to change this kind of thinking. ""The protesters represent a small minority in Israel, where most people support the war. A poll taken by the Israel Democracy Institute in late December found that two-thirds of Israelis don't think the military should scale back its bombardment of densely populated areas of Gaza. Shay Daniely said he understands the fears evoked by the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel. He's with the group Breaking the Silence that collects accounts of veteran Israeli soldiers speaking out about their time in service. But Daniely said most Israelis either do not understand what's happening in Gaza or prefer not to look. ""You can look at the mainstream news. It looks like the 7th of October happened yesterday,"" he said, referring to Israeli media coverage of the war. ""There's no understanding or footage of the Palestinian people, the Gazans, so it's really one-dimensional. ""The streets of Tel Aviv are plastered in signs that read ""Bring Them Home,"" a reference to the hostages taken in the attacks. It's a rallying cry everyone in Israel supports, particularly as a growing number of captives have died in the war there. But how to free the hostages — through continued fighting or diplomacy — is a point of fierce debate and disagreement, including among Israel's War Cabinet. The families of hostages blocked a major highway on Thursday night in another attempt at pressuring the government to do more to secure their release. Cindy Cohen, an antiwar activist at the march in Tel Aviv, said talking about Palestinians and Jews living in peace threatens the Israeli government that ""only wants separation and fighting. "" She said if the war ends, new elections would be held, threatening Netanyahu's grip on power. ""I believe that Netanyahu is only self-interested. He wants to continue the war so he can continue in power,"" she said. ""As long as the hostages are being held, there's a reason to continue the war. ""As she and others marched against the war, Netanyahu told Israeli reporters the war will continue for ""many more months. """"We will continue to fight at full strength until we achieve all our goals,"" he said, adding that includes ""the return of all our hostages — and I say again, only military pressure will lead to their release. ""As protesters chanted for a cease-fire to the beat of drums through Tel Aviv's busy streets, a young reservist with a rifle slung over his shoulder and his girlfriend shook their heads at the protesters. One woman shouted against the marchers as others just looked on. The march was organized by a group called Standing Together, which brings together Palestinian citizens of Israel and Jews in the country. They were joined by other peace groups. Lawyers for The Association for Civil Rights in Israel had to seek a court order to hold the protest in Tel Aviv after police refused to issue permits for it. Police have arrested and beaten protesters in other, smaller anti-war rallies in past weeks in Israel. The group is trying to get permits issued in other cities for similar protests. ACRI's Executive Director Noa Sattath said there is an ""unprecedented"" crackdown on free speech in Israel. Police are tracking and arresting activists not only at protests, but also on their way to protests, she said. ACRI filed an official complaint against Israel's police chief, Kobi Shabtai, after he said anyone who wants to identify with Gaza can go there. ""I'll help them get there,"" he said in October. ""That is such unacceptable behavior,"" Sattath said. Protesters held signs that read: ""Only peace will bring security. "" One sign said: ""Stop the genocide. ""Israel faces the charge of genocide at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands. Its military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 24,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, and wounded more than 61,000, many with amputations and severe burns, according to Gaza's Health Ministry and aid groups there. Most of Gaza's hospitals have been forced shut with the rest partially functional and unable to sufficiently treat the stream of wounded. Israel's government vehemently rejects the charge of genocide, arguing the war is against Hamas and not all of Gaza. Israel says Hamas is to blame because it uses civilian infrastructure to hide and carry out its attacks against Israel. Israeli airstrikes have reduced to rubble hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses, displacing nearly the entire population of Gaza. The head of the U. N. Human Rights Office for the Palestinian territories, Ajith Sunghay, described seeing children this week in Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians have fled, digging for bricks to hold in place tents made with plastic bags. ""This is a massive human rights crisis and a major, human-made, humanitarian disaster,"" Sunghay said. ""It is a pressure cooker environment.

79,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/19/1225623652/jordan-field-hospital-gaza-israel,"AMMAN, Jordan — The Jordanian military says Israeli forces deliberately targeted its newest field hospital in Gaza on Wednesday, blocking the entrance to the complex with a tank and shooting at the hospital and bunkers where staff were sheltering. Israel denied that it shelled the field hospital in Khan Younis, saying it was engaged in a gunfight with Hamas fighters nearby. ""This action was not a consequence of a clash with resistance factions,"" the Jordanian armed forces said in a statement Friday. It said it ""strongly asserts that the deliberate targeting of the Jordanian Field Hospital was part of Israel's consistent approach to targeting hospitals in Gaza. ""Jordan said it was the fourth deliberate targeting of its field hospitals in Gaza since the conflict began in October. The kingdom, which signed a peace agreement with neighboring Israel in 1994, established its first field hospital in Gaza more than a decade ago. In November, it set up a second hospital in Khan Younis, after its Gaza City facility was damaged and seven medics injured in what it said was an Israeli airstrike. According to the Jordanian military, Israeli forces knew the location of the hospital and knew that staff were sheltering in an adjacent concrete building. Video footage released by Jordan's armed forces showed the building with bullet holes in the concrete walls, shattered windows and bloodstains on a bed. It said one of its injured medics was evacuated by air for treatment while a patient at the hospital sustained shrapnel injuries. Jordan said the hospital incurred substantial damage — a claim denied by Israel. ""Despite ongoing coordination with the Israeli side with emphasis on refraining from targeting Jordanian hospitals, Israeli forces persist in deliberately targeting Jordanian medical facilities on a consistent basis,"" the Jordanian military said. It noted that targeting medical facilities violates international treaties, including the Geneva Convention. The Khan Younis field hospital has treated between 400 and 1,000 cases a day since it was set up in November, according to military officials. Israeli bombardment has damaged or destroyed many of Gaza's hospitals and medical clinics. Fighting has now drawn closer to the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, the largest hospital still operating in Gaza. Israel has accused Hamas of launching a munition out of the Nasser complex, which is located a few hundred yards from the Jordanian field hospital. A released Israeli hostage said she and other hostages were held in the hospital, which Hamas denied. On Thursday, the aid organization Medical Aid for Palestinians said its compound housing emergency medical staff working near the Nasser Hospital was severely damaged in a missile strike. Several team members were injured, and the staff was forced to evacuate, the group said. The World Health Organization said two weeks ago that there had been more than 300 attacks on health care facilities in Gaza since the start of the war in October, leaving fewer than half of its hospitals even partly functional while overwhelmed with injured civilians.",npr_articles/article_79.txt,npr_results/article_79.txt.json
80,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/19/1225375765/iran-pakistan-iranian-backed-proxy-flashpoints,"Pakistan launched an attack Thursday using rockets and drones against a Balochistan separatist group inside neighboring Iran, killing nine people, just two days after Iran fired rockets at a rival separatist group on Pakistan's side of the border. The attacks came as Iranian-backed groups have plunged the Middle East into crisis. Here are five things to know about Iran's involvement in a variety of flashpoints, from Gaza to Pakistan:The attacks took place in an area called Balochistan, a large region straddling Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. It has long been a space where militants, separatists and smugglers have thrived and have used the region as a redoubt to attack both Iran and Pakistan, as NPR's Diaa Hadid reported. Iran has previously conducted small ground incursions into Pakistan's Balochistan province in pursuit of militants. On Tuesday, Iran fired missiles and drones into Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province, saying it was targeting a separatist hard-line Sunni Muslim group called Jaish al-Adl. In an apparent tit for tat, Pakistan — a nuclear power — hit back with rocket and drone strikes on Thursday in an attack on a different Balochistan separatist group inside Iran. Iranian state media said the attack killed nine people. Following the attack, Pakistan's caretaker prime minister, Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar, rushed home from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to meet with the top brass and senior government officials. On Monday, the day before the Iranian strikes in Pakistan, Iran also fired missiles into the Iraqi city of Irbil, the capital of the Kurdish region in Iraq's north, killing a prominent Kurdish businessman and several other people. The strike was in the neighborhood of the U. S. Consulate. The Iranian government said it was targeting Israeli spy operations, something the Kurdish leadership denied. At the same time, Iran also fired missiles into northern Syria, in what Tehran said was revenge for the suicide bombings at the memorial ceremony in Kerman, Iran, for a top Iranian general killed by a U. S. drone strike in Iraq four years ago. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the bombings, which killed dozens of people. Iran often prefers to use its proxy forces based around the Middle East to carry out attacks against its foes. Hezbollah is a powerful militia in Lebanon. The Houthis in Yemen have launched missile attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea that have drawn repeated U. S. airstrikes in Yemen. The Palestinian militant group Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. Israel has responded with a military campaign in Gaza that has left more than 24,400 people dead, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It is more unusual for Iran to use direct missile strikes and on such a wide range of targets. After the unprecedented flare-up across the Iran-Pakistan border, analysts expected both sides to try to tamp down tensions: Iran has put on a sufficient show of force against the group it accused of attacking it, and Pakistan has responded in kind. Pakistani officials noted that all those killed in the latest strikes inside Iran were Pakistani nationals, not Iranians. The risks of further escalation were seen as diminishing. With tensions sky-high in a tinderbox region — and with a war in full spate in Gaza — the risk of another front opening up is constant, especially with a large variety of proxies, extremist groups and long-standing enemies facing off in a number of countries. Israel and Hezbollah have also been trading fire across the Lebanon-Israel border for weeks, raising the risk of a second front opening in the war.",npr_articles/article_80.txt,npr_results/article_80.txt.json
81,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/19/1225250933/gaza-rafah-tents-shortage,"RAFAH, the Gaza Strip — The tents and makeshift shelters have sprung up everywhere in recent weeks: on the streets, in the courtyards of hospitals and schools, on once-empty patches of desert that are now full. A desperate few have even set up on top of destroyed buildings. ""I felt this was a safe place because it has already been targeted. They won't hit it again,"" said Samir Salah, who evacuated Gaza City in October and now lives with his family in a tent atop a flat piece of rubble. As the war between Israel and the militant group Hamas enters a fourth month, combat in Gaza has advanced farther south, and Palestinians fleeing the violence — many of them for the third, fourth or even fifth time — have packed themselves into Rafah, Gaza's southernmost major city. More than a million displaced people are estimated to be taking shelter in the city, on top of its prewar population of 270,000. Apartments and other dwellings are housing dozens, even hundreds of people, as Israeli airstrikes continue. Shelters operated by the United Nations in Gaza are full far beyond their capacity, the U. N. says. With nowhere else to turn, Palestinians are now living in tents or makeshift shelters made of wood beams and sheets of nylon. And the swelling demand for shelters and the lack of supply has sent prices for materials skyrocketing. Satellite imagery provided to NPR by the company Planet shows the rapid expansion of the tent camps since mid-December. ""You look outside the window of one of our facilities, and all I could see was the sea of these makeshift structures,"" said Juliette Touma, a spokesperson for UNRWA, the U. N. agency that aids Palestinians. She returned Tuesday from a trip to Gaza. After Israel's ground invasion began in October following Hamas' cross-border attacks, Mohammed Abu Salah and his family fled from their home in Absan, an area near Gaza's eastern border, heeding Israel's urging to seek shelter in Khan Younis. But the fighting has since come to Khan Younis, forcing them out yet again, this time into a tent. Before the war, tents in Gaza were mainly used for recreation, such as family gatherings at the beach. A high-quality tent might have cost 200 shekels, or about $50. This month, a small tent cost Abu Salah 700 shekels, or about $185, he said. That's cheap, he added: People occupying nearby shelters paid double, or more. ""Opportunists are making use of this war. They hope this war continues so they can keep making money,"" Abu Salah said. Some people have posted on social media offering tents for rent or sale. Some may be trying to make money, Palestinians told NPR, while others say they were forced to sell shelter materials in order to pay for food and water. Without enough tarps and nylon, Palestinians have resorted to using cloth and rugs for tent walls. Others have repurposed the large tarps that cover the truckloads of aid that enter each day from Egypt and Israel. A man with a sewing machine, working on the streets of Rafah, sewed together nylon bags used to deliver aid. (The bags cost two shekels apiece, plus the cost of sewing them together, the man said. )Palestinians living in the tent areas say aid workers have collected personal information and asked occupants about their needs. Some reported receiving tents or materials after a waiting period, while others say they have been waiting for weeks and have received nothing yet. Asked how many tents the U. N. has disbursed, UNRWA's Touma said, ""We've given some. But we ran out early on, and we're not getting enough in. We should be getting more in. ""Aid of all kinds has been in short supply since the war began. The U. N. reports shortages of at least 50,000 family-sized tents, along with more than a million mattresses and blankets. Some badly needed tents may be waiting just on the other side of Gaza's borders. Earlier this month, U. S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, visited the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing, where aid is subjected to exhaustive inspection by Israelis before it enters Gaza. There, he visited a warehouse full of humanitarian goods that had been rejected at Israeli inspection points, he told NPR. Workers told him the rejected aid included tents, Van Hollen said. ""The speculation was that some of them had metal poles in them, and somehow those could be used by Hamas to fashion weapons, despite the fact that you have thousands and thousands of Gazans without shelter as the weather gets very cold,"" he said. Israel says it must inspect aid to keep out anything that could be appropriated by Hamas for military use. The U. N. and other aid groups have called for a smoother inspection process in order to allow for greater amounts of assistance to enter Gaza. The living conditions have escalated concerns about health and sanitation. The tent areas are crowded, and there are no bathroom or bathing facilities. Fresh water must be purchased. ""These are not conditions meant for human beings,"" said Touma. ""There is no water here, and toilets are another source of suffering,"" said Awni Nejem, who fled to Rafah from the Nuseirat refugee camp, where Israeli airstrikes have hit repeatedly since mid-November. Trash is also an issue, he said. He and his new neighbors collect garbage at a single spot, but the man who takes it away can only come by every third day. ""My neighbor told me he did not eat for two days. Can you imagine?"" Nejem said. ""I understand people can take in suffering, but not this much. This is unbearable. ""Nighttime temperatures have dipped into the 40s this month. Tents are not winterproof or waterproof, and the wintertime rain has soaked people's limited belongings. Tent occupants described pests, including ants and snakes. ""You can see worms already here. Bugs and lizards are everywhere. I killed a snake inside the tent the other day,"" said Ayman Bar, who has spent 500 shekels so far on a tent to house his family. He is still hoping to find metal for a roof, he said. The Israeli bombardment has left much of Gaza in ruins, especially in the north, where up to 80% or more of buildings are thought to be damaged or destroyed, according to an analysis of satellite imagery by researchers at the City University of New York and Oregon State University. The U. N. estimates that at least 500,000 Palestinians — nearly a quarter of Gaza's population — no longer have a home to return to. Before the war, nearly six in 10 Palestinians were poor, and 80% were already dependent on aid, according to the World Bank. Unemployment stood at 45%. The average daily income was only $13 in 2022, the State Department reported. And even for those with means, the struggles of displacement have been humbling. Access to the banking system in Gaza is extremely limited. Bank locations are closed or inaccessible. ATMs are frequently offline or out of cash. (During the seven-day cease-fire in November, the Bank of Palestine and the U. N. embarked on a secret operation to move some $50 million worth of 200-shekel bills to alleviate the cash shortage in the south, the Financial Times reported in December. ) And many Palestinians do not use the banking system, preferring instead to keep cash savings at homes that have now been abandoned or destroyed. Samir Salah, the man who set up his tent on a destroyed building, said he was wealthy before the war. He owned a house in al-Mughraqa, a town just south of Gaza City, along with apartments in Juhor ad-Dik and Shijaiyah. But the bombardment arrived quickly and intensely, he said. ""We had to run only with the clothes we were wearing, and I only had 400 shekels with me,"" or about $100, he said. He doesn't know what the condition of his homes are now. Instead, he lives in a simple shelter made of eight planks of wood and nylon. He lacks even a mattress, sleeping only on a blanket he received recently from an aid group. A cousin gave him a blanket to use to stay warm. Becky Sullivan reported from Tel Aviv. Anas Baba reported from Rafah.

The tense back and forth reflected what has become a wide rift between the two allies over the scope of Israel's war and its plans for the future of the beleaguered territory. ""We obviously see it differently,"" White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said. Netanyahu spoke just a day after U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israel would never have ""genuine security"" without a pathway toward Palestinian independence. Earlier this week, the White House also announced that it was the ""right time"" for Israel to lower the intensity of its devastating military offensive in Gaza. In a nationally televised news conference, Netanyahu struck a defiant tone, repeatedly saying that Israel would not halt its offensive until it realizes its goals of destroying Gaza's Hamas militant group and bringing home all remaining hostages held by Hamas. He rejected claims by a growing chorus of Israeli critics that those goals are not achievable, vowing to press ahead for many months. ""We will not settle for anything short of an absolute victory,"" Netanyahu said. Israel launched the offensive after an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas on Oct. 7 that killed 1,200 people and took some 250 others hostage. Roughly 130 hostages are believed by Israel to remain in Hamas captivity. The war has stoked tensions across the region, threatening to ignite other conflicts. Israel's assault, one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history, has killed nearly 25,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities, caused widespread destruction and uprooted over 80% of the territory's 2. 3 million people from their homes. The staggering cost of the war has led to increasing calls from the international community to halt the offensive. After initially giving Israel wall-to-wall support in the early days of the war, the United States, Israel's closest ally, has begun to express misgivings and urged Netanyahu to spell out his vision for postwar Gaza. The United States has said the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, which governs semi-autonomous zones in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, should be ""revitalized"" and return to Gaza. Hamas ousted the authority from Gaza in 2007. The U. S. has also called for steps toward the establishment of a Palestinian state. The Palestinians seek Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem for their state. Those areas were captured by Israel in 1967. Speaking Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Blinken said the two-state solution was the best way to protect Israel, unify moderate Arab countries and isolate Israel's arch-enemy, Iran. Without a ""pathway to a Palestinian state,"" he said, Israel would not ""get genuine security. ""At the same conference, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said the kingdom is ready to establish full relations with Israel as part of a larger political agreement. ""But that can only happen through peace for the Palestinians, through a Palestinian state,"" he said. Netanyahu, who leads a far-right government opposed to Palestinian statehood, repeated his longstanding opposition to a two-state solution. He said a Palestinian state would become a launching pad for attacks on Israel. He said Israel ""must have security control over the entire territory west of the Jordan River,"" adding: ""That collides with the idea of sovereignty. What can we do?""""This truth I tell to our American friends, and I put the brakes on the attempt to coerce us to a reality that would endanger the state of Israel,"" he said. The comments prompted an immediate rebuke from the White House. Kirby said that President Joe Biden would ""not stop working"" toward a two-state solution. Before Oct. 7, Israeli society was bitterly divided over Netanyahu's plan for a judicial overhaul. Since the attack, the country has rallied behind the war. But divisions have once again begun to surface over Netanyahu's handling of the war. Families of the hostages and their many supporters have called for a new cease-fire that could bring them home. Hamas released over 100 hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners during a weeklong cease-fire in November. Dozens of people attended a somber gathering in Tel Aviv in solidarity with the family of Kfir Bibas, the youngest Israeli hostage, marking his first birthday. The red-haired infant and his 4-year-old brother Ariel were taken hostage along with their mother, Shiri, and their father, Yarden. All four remain in captivity. Commentators have begun to question whether Netanyahu's objectives are realistic, given the slow pace of the offensive and growing international criticism, including genocide accusations at the United Nations world court, which Israel vehemently denies. Netanyahu's opponents accuse him of delaying any discussion of postwar scenarios to avoid looming investigations of governmental failures, keep his coalition intact and put off elections. Polls show that the popularity of Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, has plummeted during the war. There was no word Thursday on whether medicines that entered the territory as part of a deal brokered by France and Qatar had been distributed to dozens hostages with chronic illnesses who are being held by Hamas. The agreement was the first to be brokered between the warring sides since November. The deal includes large shipments of medicine, food and humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians as well. Qatar confirmed late Wednesday that the medicine had entered Gaza, but it was not yet clear if it had been distributed to the hostages, who are being held in secret locations, including underground bunkers. The International Committee for the Red Cross, which helped facilitate the hostage releases, said it was not involved in distributing the medicine. Hamas has continued to fight back across Gaza, even in the most devastated areas, and launch rockets into Israel. It says it will not release any more hostages until there is a permanent cease-fire, something Israel and the United States, its top ally, have ruled out. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have heeded Israeli evacuation orders and packed into southern Gaza, where shelters run by the United Nations are overflowing and massive tent camps have gone up. Israel has continued to strike what it says are militant targets in all parts of Gaza, often killing women and children. Early Thursday, medics said an Israeli airstrike on a home killed 16 people, half of them children, in the southern Gaza town of Rafah. Israel blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it fights in dense residential areas. Israel says its forces have killed roughly 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and that 193 of its own soldiers have been killed since the Gaza ground offensive began. On Thursday, the Israeli army said it had destroyed ""the heart"" of Hamas' weapons manufacturing industry near a major north-south road in central Gaza. It said the complex included weapons factories and an extensive tunnel network used to ship arms throughout Gaza. The war has rippled across the Middle East, with Iranian-backed groups attacking U. S. and Israeli targets. Low-intensity fighting between Israel and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon threatens to erupt into all-out war, and Houthi rebels in Yemen continue to target international shipping despite United States-led airstrikes. The Israeli military said it fired an interceptor at a ""suspicious aerial target"" — likely a drone or missile — approaching over the Red Sea on Thursday, triggering air raid sirens in the southern city of Eilat. The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel that mostly fell short or were intercepted and shot down. Meanwhile, Iran has launched a series of missile attacks targeting what it described as an Israeli spy base in Iraq and militant bases in Syria.",npr_articles/article_82.txt,npr_results/article_82.txt.json
83,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/18/1225189908/gaza-communication-blackout-paltel-israel-hamas,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Juliette Touma is the director of communications for the United Nations agency that delivers aid to Gaza. She was there earlier this week, but she couldn't do her job. ""I mean I couldn't even hold a phone call to record an interview, like I'm doing with you now,"" Touma told NPR shortly after she returned. Gaza is approaching a week without internet and cellphone service. The lack of communications is making it difficult for the U. N. to distribute the small amount of food and supplies it can get into the territory, which has been under heavy Israeli bombardment since shortly after Hamas militants attacked Israel in October. ""For aid operations and to coordinate the delivery of assistance it's extremely difficult not to have a phone line,"" she said. Gaza has had blackouts before, most notably when Israel sent ground troops into the territory in late October. But this one is different, according to Alp Toker, director of Netblocks, a company that tracks disruption to internet services in conflict zones. ""This one is now the longest single such blackout,"" he said. But Toker said he doubts the blackout is due to something like an Israeli cyberattack. Its length is unusual, and it doesn't appear to coincide with any specific Israeli operation, he said. ""It's too easy an answer to just say look, Israel is just flicking on and off the service at will. ""In a statement posted shortly after the latest blackout began, Paltel, Gaza's main internet provider, blamed ""ongoing aggression"" for the problem. Samer Fares, director of Palestinian mobile provider Ooredoo, told NPR that an underground fiber-optic line connecting internet and cellphone towers in Gaza to Israel and the West Bank was severed by Israeli military activity in the vicinity of Khan Younis in southern Gaza. ""Paltel has been trying to fix the cut in the line, but they haven't been able to because of intense military operations in the area,"" he said. In fact, two Paltel workers were killed last week as they drove out to make repairs. Fares said they were struck by Israeli tank fire. Fares said that the deaths are slowing repair efforts. ""Work in Gaza is very dangerous to everyone,"" he said. ""Although we coordinate for maintenance operations, the bombardment is very intense. ""In a statement to NPR, the Israeli military said it's launched an independent investigation into the incident. Ryan Sturgill is an entrepreneur based in Amman, Jordan, who has been trying to help people get a signal using Israeli and Egyptian cellular networks. He believes that the ongoing blackout is undoubtedly imperiling the lives of people in Gaza. Without phones, civilians can't call ambulances for help if they are wounded, or warn each other of dangerous areas to avoid. The Israeli military is continuing to announce ""safe corridors"" on social media, but people in Gaza can't see them if they don't have service. ""Access to lifesaving information is just fundamentally reliant on communications,"" he said. The U. N. has echoed these concerns. ""The blackout of telecommunications prevents people in Gaza from accessing lifesaving information or calling for first responders, and impedes other forms of humanitarian response,"" it said on Wednesday. The laws of war date from the last century, and were written well before cellphones. But in the modern era, Sturgill believes connectivity is essential to survival. ""I mean in almost every conflict since the rise of the internet, there has always been some connectivity,"" he said. ""Even a landline.

84,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/18/1225003548/joe-sacco-palestine-gaza-comics-journalism,"When cartoonist Joe Sacco first published Palestine a little more than 30 years ago, most people were indifferent. The nonfiction graphic novel was part comic book, part memoir of his journeys through the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and nothing like it had ever really been published before. Today, the acclaimed graphic novel is considered a trailblazing work, and as the war in Gaza continues to rage, the book is experiencing a resurgence. Demand is so high that the book is out of stock, prompting its publisher to take the rare step of ordering a rapid reprinting. Gary Groth, president and co-founder of Fantagraphics, said the newfound interest in Palestine began after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants that killed more than 1,200 people in Israel. The attack unleashed an Israeli bombardment of Gaza that has so far killed more than 24,000 Palestinians, according to health officials in Gaza. ""You don't have momentous events like this occur that are relevant to most books,"" he said. ""The subject matter, unfortunately, appears to be timeless. ""Sacco told NPR he originally traveled to the region out of a desire to talk to Palestinians, a perspective he never had growing up. ""I was particularly interested because I felt that journalism, which is what I had studied, had not served me well,"" he said. ""[It] had actually given me quite a skewed version of events in the Middle East in general and in the Palestinian territories in particular. ""At the time, Sacco was working as a full-time cartoonist after not finding a satisfying journalism job. But when he arrived on his trip, his journalistic background kicked in when he realized the importance of interviewing civilians to show the daily reality of living under occupation. ""There were all these things about the occupation I began to find out. I think the thing that really sticks in my head is how all these things sort of led up to attacks on people's dignity,"" he said. ""Because when you cannot go from one point to another without being stopped, without being checked, without being taken out of the car, when you worry about going to school, when you're taken to prison and you're beaten, crowded together in very unsanitary situations, all these things are obviously an attempt to degrade people. ""He initially didn't have a clear idea of format other than that he wanted to draw himself in the scene, which he later realized the importance of. ""Because it shows the reader that all this is being filtered through a human being. I'm not the all-seeing journalist floating above that knows everything and, you know, has it all figured out,"" he said. Palestine would become a pioneering work that popularized a new kind of storytelling: ""comics journalism. ""  Groth attributes the book's lasting success in large part to its humanistic nature. ""I think one of its great strengths is that it portrays the Palestinians as three-dimensional human beings. And it's not a strident book. It's not ideologically divisive in that way,"" said Groth. Although Sacco is glad his book can help inform readers, its resurgence comes tinged with sadness that the topic still has such validity.  ""In some ways, you know, you need the context, and in other ways, how much do you need the context? I mean, sit a child in front of the TV and they will know right away it's not right,"" Sacco said, referring to the war in Gaza. ""You almost don't need context when you see that level of violence visited on civilians, on women and on children. ""But the advantage that drawings have over images in the news, he said, is that drawings are more digestible to look at. ""You know, that there's a filter between you and the violence and that's the drawn image. """"And I think they can take you back into the past,"" Sacco continued. ""You can reimagine with drawings the past — what the refugee camps used to look like and what they look like now. You can show that continuum.

85,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/17/1225294463/houthis-yemen-us-airstrikes-red-sea-israel-hamas,"WASHINGTON — The U. S. military fired another wave of ship- and submarine-launched missile strikes against Houthi-controlled sites Wednesday, multiple U. S. officials said, marking the fourth time in days it has directly targeted the group in Yemen as violence that ignited in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war continues to spill over in the Middle East. The strikes were launched from the Red Sea and hit more than a dozen sites, the officials said. The strikes followed an official announcement Wednesday that the U. S. has put the Houthis back on its list of specially designated global terrorists. The sanctions that come with the formal designation are meant to sever violent extremist groups from their sources of financing. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that have not been made public yet. Houthi-run al-Masirah TV said on Telegram that the strikes targeted the governorates of Dhamar, Hodieda, Taiz, al-Bayda and Saada. Despite the sanctions and military strikes, including a large-scale operation Friday carried out by U. S. and British warships and warplanes that hit more than 60 targets across Yemen, the Houthis are continuing their harassment campaign of commercial and military ships. The latest incident occurred Wednesday when a one-way attack drone was launched from a Houthi-controlled area in Yemen and struck the Marshall Islands-flagged, U. S. -owned and -operated M/V Genco Picardy in the Gulf of Aden. The U. S. has also strongly warned Iran to cease providing weapons to the Houthis. On Thursday a U. S. raid on a dhow intercepted ballistic missile parts the U. S. said Iran was shipping to Yemen. Two U. S. Navy SEALs remain unaccounted for after one was knocked off the vessel by a wave during the seizure and the second followed the overcome SEAL into the water. On Wednesday, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said the U. S. would continue to take military action to prevent further attacks. ""They are exploiting this situation to conduct attacks against the ships and vessels from more than 50 countries . . . around the world. And so we're going to continue to work with our partners in the region to prevent those attacks or deter those attacks in the future,"" Ryder said. There have been several incidents since the Friday joint operations. The Houthis fired an anti-ship cruise missile toward a U. S. Navy destroyer over the weekend, but the ship shot it down. The Houthis then struck a U. S. -owned ship in the Gulf of Aden on Monday and a Malta-flagged bulk carrier in the Red Sea on Tuesday. In response Tuesday, the U. S. struck four anti-ship ballistic missiles that were prepared to launch and presented an imminent threat to merchant and U. S. Navy ships in the region. Hours later, the Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack on the Malta-flagged bulk carrier Zografia. The ship was hit, but no one was injured and it continued on its way.",npr_articles/article_85.txt,npr_results/article_85.txt.json
86,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/17/1224889340/gaza-palestinian-displacement-israel-war,"BEIT HANINA AL-BALAD, Israeli-Occupied West Bank — Fatima Abu Dahouk sits on her porch on a rocky hillside in the rain, ruing the day in 1948 that her grandparents fled the farm that had been in their family for centuries, in what is now southern Israel. ""They thought they were leaving for only a month, maybe two,"" says Abu Dahouk, a 36-year-old mother of four. ""But promises were broken. ""They were never allowed back. Nor were the vast majority of Palestinians who fled or were expelled when Israel was created. Their homes were destroyed or given to Jewish refugees. Few, if any, received compensation for the loss of their land and property. Amnesty International says Israel has failed to recognize their right under international law to return to their land. ""We still have land deeds that data back to the Ottoman era,"" says Abu Dahouk's husband, Sakher Abu Dahouk, 56, whose relatives hail from the same area. Since 1948, his extended family has moved several times — from what is now Beer Sheva, Israel, to Jordan, to the Israeli-occupied West Bank — as Israel seized territory in subsequent wars, redrew boundaries and built more Jewish settlements. That first displacement in 1948 set off a chain reaction — like dominoes falling, Fatima says — which has landed her here: A cinderblock house wedged between a sheep pen and a dry riverbed, behind a section of giant concrete barrier Israel built in 2002 after the second Palestinian intifada uprising. Over the past three months, the vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza — some 2 million people — have been internally displaced by war, according to the United Nations. Some members of Israel's government want them to leave Gaza altogether. But family histories like the Abu Dahouks' are why that idea hits such a nerve. It evokes the trauma of an earlier displacement that has become part of what it means to be Palestinian. That displacement reverberates through Palestinian music, culture and art. And it explains why people in Gaza — many, or perhaps most of whom have seen their homes destroyed — may refuse to relocate outside the Gaza Strip, even temporarily. In November, two Israeli lawmakers published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal calling for ""countries around the world to accept limited numbers of Gazan families who have expressed a desire to relocate. "" (The authors, current members of Israel's parliament, are from two different political parties. Danny Danon, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing Likud Party, is a former Israeli ambassador to the U. N. ; Ram Ben-Barak, from a centrist political party called Yesh Atid, is a former director of Israel's Mossad spy agency. )The idea of ""voluntary migration"" of Palestinians from Gaza — defined as the resettlement abroad of those who are willing — has gained traction with at least two members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition. ""We have to further the solution of supporting the migration of Gazan residents,"" Israel's national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, told a Jan. 3 news conference. ""It is a correct, just, moral, and humane solution. ""Israel's finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has also expressed support for the large-scale transfer of civilians from Gaza. Last month, he told Israeli media that the removal of around 90% of Palestinians from the area would make Israel safer. ""If there are 100,000 or 200,000 Arabs in Gaza and not 2 million, the whole discourse about the day after [the war ends] will be different,"" Smotrich was quoted as saying. The U. S. State Department has called these comments ""inflammatory and irresponsible. "" Both Smotrich and Ben-Gvir also live in West Bank settlements that the U. N. and U. S. consider to be illegally built on Palestinian land. Netanyahu has distanced himself from his ministers' statements. ""Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population,"" he said in a video statement Jan. 10. Civilians in Gaza, for their part, are just struggling to survive. Gaza health officials say more than 24,000 people have been killed in Israel's military operation in the Gaza Strip over the past three months, since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack that Israel says killed 1,200 people. The United Nations warns famine is imminent. But many Palestinians say they've heard about Ben-Gvir and Smotrich's statements — and are alarmed. ""We refuse to allow history to repeat itself,"" Zakaria Basouni, 55, told NPR on Jan. 14 in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city. Basouni fled bombing in northern Gaza and was taking refuge in Rafah, which has absorbed more than 1 million internally displaced people since Oct. 7. He said he's determined not to flee any farther south to Egypt, even if the border opens. He said he'd rather die in Gaza than leave his land. ""We've been evicted from our homes under fire,"" another evacuee from northern Gaza, 27-year-old Mohammed Subeh, told NPR in Rafah on the same day. ""It's just like our ancestors always told us, about how they lived in safety until they were suddenly dispersed to different countries. """"I won't let it happen to my family again,"" Subeh said. Even with many, perhaps most, of the residential buildings in Gaza destroyed, many Palestinians fear exile more than anything. So even if aid agencies were to explore temporarily transferring Gaza's civilians abroad — either to keep them safe while Israel fights Hamas or to house them while rebuilding Gaza after the war — that prospect is likely to face fierce opposition from Palestinians themselves. The U. N. 's humanitarian coordinator, Martin Griffiths, said Jan. 12 that some countries have ""offered to host civilians who want to leave Gaza, for their protection. "" He didn't specify which countries. Israeli media, citing unnamed sources, report that members of Netanyahu's government have held secret talks with officials from the Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries to discuss their possible willingness to absorb Palestinian refugees from Gaza. Congolese officials denied the reports, as did an Israeli official. A British think tank run by former Prime Minister Tony Blair also denied as a ""lie"" an Israeli TV report that Blair met Netanyahu in late December to discuss a role in resettling Palestinians from Gaza. The U. N. 's Griffiths says he's ""alarmed"" by any talk of transferring Palestinians out of Gaza. ""These statements [by Israeli ministers] raise grave concerns about the possible forcible mass transfer or deportation of the Palestinian population from the Gaza Strip, something that would be strictly prohibited under international law,"" Griffiths told the Security Council. In 1948, and again in 1967, Palestinians displaced from their lands were resettled in U. N. refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. These areas are still dotted with camps, and they no longer feel temporary. In fact, they're mostly indistinguishable from the urban streets around them. Palestinian refugee camps house schools, markets, mosques and U. N. offices. In the Al-Am'ari camp in the West Bank capital Ramallah, narrow passageways are spraypainted with graffiti celebrating Hamas and other militant groups. That's where Mohammed Suleiman Khader, 84, has lived for 76 years — since he was 8 years old. He was born in an Arab village called Al-Na'ani, south of what is now Tel Aviv. ""I remember the Zionist gangs coming to our village, pressuring us to leave. We were the last family to go,"" Khader recalls, paging through an atlas of depopulated Arab villages. ""I remember it like yesterday. We left at 5 p. m. , with our bedding on our backs. ""The village was destroyed after his family left, he says. He couldn't go back. ""I still remember the watermelons we grew in our garden,"" Khader says, smiling. He says his parents died with regrets that they didn't insist on staying on their land — come what may. It's what many Palestinians in Gaza are weighing now, Khader says. ""What we felt then, our people are feeling again now,"" he says.

87,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/16/1225123830/france-and-qatar-announce-a-deal-to-deliver-medicine-to-israeli-hostages-in-gaza,"RAFAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian militants battled Israeli forces in devastated northern Gaza and launched a barrage of rockets from farther south on Tuesday in a show of force more than 100 days into Israel's massive air and ground campaign against the tiny coastal enclave. The fighting in the north, which was the first target of Israel's offensive and where entire neighborhoods have been pulverized, showed how far Israel remains from achieving its goals of dismantling Hamas and returning scores of hostages captured in the Oct. 7 attack that sparked the war. In other developments, France and Qatar, the Persian Gulf nation that helped mediate a previous cease-fire, said late Tuesday that they had brokered a deal between Israel and Hamas to deliver medicine to Israeli hostages in Gaza, as well as additional aid to Palestinians in the besieged territory. France said it had been working since October on the deal, which will provide three months' worth of medication for 45 hostages with chronic illnesses, as well as other medicines and vitamins. The medicines are expected to enter Gaza from Egypt on Wednesday. It was the first known agreement between the warring sides since a weeklong truce in November. Meanwhile, Gaza's humanitarian crisis is worsening, with 85% of the territory's 2. 3 million Palestinians having fled their homes and U. N. agencies warning of mass starvation and disease. The conflict threatens to widen after the U. S. and Israel traded strikes with Iranian-backed groups across the region. Israel has vowed to crush Hamas' military and governing capabilities to ensure that the Oct. 7 attack is never repeated. Militants stormed into Israel from Gaza that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and capturing around 250 people. With strong diplomatic and military support from the United States, Israel has resisted international calls for a cease-fire. Nearly half of the hostages were released during the truce, but more than 100 remain in captivity. Hamas has said it will not release any others until Israel ends the war. The longer the war goes on, the more it threatens to ignite other fronts across the region. Iran fired missiles late Monday at what it said were Israeli ""spy headquarters"" in an upscale neighborhood near the sprawling U. S. Consulate in Irbil, the seat of Iraq's northern semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Iraq and the U. S. condemned the strikes, which killed several civilians, and Baghdad recalled its ambassador to Iran in protest. Iranian-backed groups in Iraq and Syria have carried out dozens of attacks on bases housing U. S. forces, and a U. S. airstrike in Baghdad killed an Iranian-backed militia leader earlier this month. Elsewhere, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have resumed their attacks on container ships in the Red Sea following a wave of U. S. -led strikes last week. The U. S. military carried out another strike Tuesday. Separately, it said two Navy SEALS are missing after a raid last week on a ship carrying Iranian-made missile parts and weapons bound for Yemen. Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group have exchanged fire along the border nearly every day since the war in Gaza began. The strikes and counterstrikes have grown more severe since an Israeli strike killed Hamas' deputy political leader in Beirut this month, raising fears of a repeat of the 2006 war. In Gaza, the Israeli military said its forces located some 100 rocket installations and 60 ready-to-use rockets in the area of Beit Lahiya, a town on the territory's northern edge. Israeli forces killed dozens of militants during the operation, the military said, without providing evidence. Mahmoud Abdel-Ghani, who lives in Beit Lahiya, said Israeli airstrikes hit several buildings on the eastern side of the town. Hundreds of thousands of people fled northern Gaza, including Gaza City, following Israeli evacuation orders in October. Israel shut off water to the north in the opening days of the war, and hardly any aid has been allowed into the area, even as tens of thousands of people have remained there. Residents reached by phone Tuesday described the heaviest fighting in weeks in Gaza City. ""The bombing never stopped,"" said Faris Abu Abbas, who lives in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood. ""The resistance is here and didn't leave. ""Ayoub Saad, who lives near Shifa Hospital downtown, said he heard gunfire and shelling overnight and into Tuesday and saw dead and wounded people being brought to the hospital on carts. After weeks of heavy fighting across northern Gaza, Israeli officials said at the start of the year that they were scaling back operations there. The focus shifted to the southern city of Khan Younis and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. But there too, they have encountered heavy resistance. The military said at least 25 rockets were fired into Israel on Tuesday, damaging a store in one of the strongest bombardments in more than a week. Israel's Channel 12 television said the rockets were launched from the Bureij camp in central Gaza. Gaza's Health Ministry said Tuesday that the bodies of 158 people killed in Israeli strikes have been brought to hospitals in the past 24 hours, bringing the war's overall death toll to 24,285. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but says around two-thirds of those killed were women and children. Senior U. N. officials warned Monday that Gaza faces widespread famine and disease if more aid is not allowed in. While they did not directly blame Israel, they said aid delivery is hobbled by the opening of too few border crossings, a slow vetting process, and continuing fighting throughout the territory — all of which is largely under Israel's control. U. N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said U. N. agencies and their partners ""cannot effectively deliver humanitarian aid while Gaza is under such heavy, widespread and unrelenting bombardment. "" At least 152 U. N. staffers have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war. Israeli officials say they have placed no limits on humanitarian aid and have called on the U. N. to provide more workers and trucks to accelerate delivery. Israel completely sealed off Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack and only relented under U. S. pressure. The U. S. , as well as the U. N. , have continued to push Israel to ease the flow of aid. Israel blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it fights in dense residential areas. Israel says its forces have killed roughly 8,000 militants, without providing evidence, and that 190 of its own soldiers have been killed in the Gaza offensive.",npr_articles/article_87.txt,npr_results/article_87.txt.json
88,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/16/1224767491/israel-hezbollah-economy-lebanon-gaza,"KATZRIN, the Golan Heights — The tours at the Golan Heights Winery used to take place daily, stopping by the fermentation tanks and the cellar where thousands of oak barrels are stacked 20 feet into the air. But the tourists and honeymooners stopped coming to this pastoral hills region after Oct. 7, 2023, when fighters from the militant group Hamas attacked southern Israel and touched off a war that has continued into the new year. The Oct. 7 attack happened far from here, more than 100 miles away from the winery. But much closer is Israel's border with Lebanon, home to Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-backed armed force with whom Israel warred in 2006 — and with whom tensions have risen this month. ""The sound of planes, helicopters, booms, that's kind of routine,"" said Victor Schoenfeld, the head winemaker. No Hezbollah rockets have struck nearby — for now, the winery's top executive said. ""Not yet,"" said CEO Assaf Ben Dov. ""We don't know. ""The conflict, even at its current simmer rather than the full-blown war taking place in Gaza, has already taken an economic toll in these northern regions: Towns are emptied of people. Businesses are shuttered. Farm fields, including vineyards, lay untended, putting production timelines in jeopardy. ""We will need to find new strategies. I don't see any new or quick solution that will appear,"" said Ben Dov. Six Israeli civilians have died in cross-border attacks from Lebanon, Israeli officials say, including an elderly mother and son killed Sunday by a pair of anti-tank missile strikes on their home in Kfar Yuval. Lebanese officials say at least 20 civilians have died on the other side of the border. Residents have fled the region by the tens of thousands. If they decide it will never be safe enough to return home, ""it will affect the economy in these places in the long run in a way that could definitely be lethal,"" said Tomer Fadlon, an economist at Tel Aviv University. Even if Israel achieves its military objectives in the south, an economic recovery in the north is far from guaranteed, Fadlon said. ""So this war was not only about winning the war. It is also about gaining back the feeling that they can go home safe, run a business and run their life,"" he said. The winery is located in the Golan Heights, a territory claimed by Syria that Israel seized in 1967 and has occupied ever since. Hezbollah's rockets haven't yet reached as far as the winery, about 13 miles from the Lebanon border, but much of its staff lives in northern Israel, where the sounds of war are now routine. Of the 130 employees at the Golan Heights facility, 12 are reservists who were called up to active duty after the war began. (In total Israel has mobilized some 360,000 reservists, causing significant labor shortages, including in the country's high-powered tech sector. ) The loss of staff means the winery is running behind their normal production schedule. Much more affected is the ownership group's second winery, the Galil Mountain Winery, which is located in Kibbutz Yir'On, only a few hundred yards from the Lebanon border. Visitors can see into Lebanon from the winery building, Ben Dov said. ""You used to see Hezbollah flags right next to us,"" he said. ""I hope they're not there anymore. ""The Israeli military ordered the evacuation of areas along the border in October, including Yir'On. The Galil Mountain Winery has been entirely shut down ever since. Managers must seek daily permission from the Israeli military to access the facility, Ben Dov said. Most concerning are the winery's vineyards, 90% of which are located along the border and are currently inaccessible, Schoenfeld said. Grape vines must be pruned in the winter, an important step in wine making. Were there not a war, the staff would be pruning now. But the military will not let staff access the vineyards while the conflict with Hezbollah is still so volatile, he said. The pruning can be put off for a couple months, perhaps, Schoenfeld said. But eventually there comes a natural deadline: The plants will start pushing leaves by the end of March or early April, meaning pruning must be done before then. ""If things aren't accessible by then, we have some strategies,"" Schoenfeld said. ""But the longer it goes on, the more complicated it's gonna be. "" Consumer spending in Israel has been depressed since the outbreak of war, said economist Fadlon, who has tracked credit card spending. (Only in one week of the war so far — in late November, when a temporary ceasefire was negotiated to exchange Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners — did Israelis spend more than a typical pre-war week, he said. )Unlike cities further from the conflict, like Tel Aviv, which have mostly rebounded from the initial shock of war, the economies of border communities are still profoundly impacted. In Kiryat Shmona, the largest city on Israel's side of the northern border, credit card spending levels are still 70% or more below normal, Fadlon said. One of the few open businesses in Kiryat Shmona is Shlomi Baguette, a counter-service shawarma restaurant. ""Most of Kiryat Shmona is evacuated. But we're working as usual,"" said Toby Abutbul, 22, whose father runs the restaurant. Soldiers stationed in the north now make up 80% or more of the restaurant's sales, Abutbul said. ""We will not let the soldiers stay hungry, you understand? We help them how we can,"" he said. An estimated 60,000 people have fled the border region, staying for months with family or in hotels away from the conflict. In November, the Bank of Israel estimated that the absence at work of 144,000 evacuated residents, about 40% of whom have fled the north, had cost Israel's economy about 590 million shekels, or $158 million, each week. That impact would be felt even more widely should evacuees decide not to return, Fadlon said. ""If you have so many people that want to stay in these places and want to move elsewhere, it will affect everything, the cost of living, even the real estate and everything else,"" he said.  The central bank has assessed that the total budgetary cost of the war, to Israel, will be 210 billion shekels, or about $56 billion — nearly half an entire year's budget for Israel, a country with fewer than 10 million residents. That forecast ""assumes that the lion's share of the war will occur on one front, Gaza,"" said Amir Yaron, the bank's top official, on New Year's Day. ""It is clear that the length of time, and the developments of the war to additional areas, can change the estimates markedly. ""A potential second front could be the north. Leaders from Hezbollah and Israel have both said they are prepared to go to war if necessary. ""We will restore security to both the south and the north. Nobody will stop us – not The Hague, not the axis of evil and not anybody else,"" said  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday. ""If we have a war with Hezbollah, given the arsenal that they have, they can paralyze the country for a month or longer,"" said Esteban Klor, a researcher at Hebrew University of Jerusalem who studies the intersection of terrorism and economics. Hezbollah, the world's most heavily armed non-state actor, is far better equipped than Hamas, analysts say. It is estimated to have 130,000 or more rockets and missiles in its arsenal, some with a range that could allow the group to strike targets all across Israel. The effects of a full-blown war with Hezbollah would extend far beyond the north, Klor said. ""People are going to have to stay home in shelters, and so the entire country will probably stop working for the duration of that war,"" he said. The question has taken on greater urgency this month after a strike in Lebanon's capital Beirut killed a top Hamas official. Israel has not taken responsibility for the strike, but still Hezbollah has retaliated. In addition to the two civilians killed in Kfar Yuval, attacks from Lebanon in recent days have damaged Israeli military infrastructure and injured at least six soldiers, officials say. An outbreak of war with Hezbollah could drive the cost to Israel two or three times higher, Klor said. Such an increase might send the country into a period of economic stagnation like the one that followed Israel's last major war, the Yom Kippur War of 1973. It took Israel more than a decade to recover economically, he said. In Lebanon, where the economy was already in a state of catastrophe before Oct. 7, the United Nations estimates that more than 76,000 people have fled the border region. The crisis, which dates back to 2019, is one of the worst the world has seen since the mid-1800s, the World Bank has said. Over the past four years, Lebanon's currency has collapsed and poverty has skyrocketed as political and financial leaders have resisted reform. An outbreak of war along its southern border ""could be truly, truly devastating, especially if we see what has happened in the Gaza Strip,"" Klor said.

S. -owned and -operated container ship with an anti-ship ballistic missile on Monday as it passed through the Red Sea, the U. S. military said According to U. S. Central Command, the missile hit the M/V Gibraltar Eagle, a commercial carrier flagged to the Marshall Islands, around 4 p. m. local time after being fired from Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen. No injuries or significant damage were reported. The latest attack comes less than a week after the United States and the United Kingdom, along with their allies, began conducting a series of air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen. The Pentagon says the U. S. and its allies hit 60 Houthi targets across 28 different locations this past Thursday, followed by another round of strikes over the weekend. The campaign by the U. S. and its allies came in response to a recent uptick in Houthi attacks against commercial vessels sailing through the Red Sea past Yemen, which has dogged international shipping through the area. ""These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world's most critical commercial routes,"" President Biden said when he announced the strikes last week. ""I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary. ""The U. S. military said Monday that the Houthis fired another missile toward the Red Sea shipping lanes earlier in the afternoon, but that missile failed mid-flight and landed on the ground in Yemen. No injuries or damage were reported in that incident. The Houthis say they're attacking commercial ships with ties to Israel until Israel ends its military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, which began after the Hamas attack on October 7. The Iranian-backed rebel group has used fighters and drones to attack ships, and also fired missiles at vessels passing through the southern Red Sea, forcing more than 2,000 ships to divert their course to avoid an attack. Some of the attacks have damaged ships, but U. S. warships have shot down many of the missiles and drones. The surge in attacks by the Houthis and their vocal support from Iran has raised fears that the war between Israel and Hamas could grow into a wider conflict in the Middle East. A spokesperson for Iran — which has supported the Houthis with weapons, intelligence and other aid — blasted the air strikes by Western powers and said the rebel group would continue targeting ships in the Red Sea.",npr_articles/article_89.txt,npr_results/article_89.txt.json

The bullet that killed his daughter had pierced his grandson's abdomen. I found Troen in the hospital wearing a Brandeis University t-shirt. He was one of my professors when I studied there. Three months later, I visited his home in Israel's southern desert, where he is now retired, to hear his reflections — as a historian and bereaved parent — about Israel's deadliest day in history, and the deadliest war that Palestinians have ever faced, still ongoing in Gaza. ""How am I?"" Troen asks, on his living room couch. ""In Baroque music, there's something called the basso continuo. If you listen to Bach, there's that bottom line that continues, and my basso continuo is one of sadness. ""Music was his daughter and son-in-law's life. Deborah and Shlomi Mathias were singers who met in music school. On Oct. 7, attackers from Gaza stormed their home and blew down the door of their reinforced safe room. The parents protected their son, Rotem, with their bodies, saving his life as they lost theirs. Burying them in their home community enveloped in war, Kibbutz Holit near the Gaza border, was out of the question. Instead, the family wrestled with another question: what to write on their gravestones. ""It was the children who decided that they would not put on their parents' gravestone what some other people have done. . . 'may God avenge their blood. ' They wanted nothing of that,"" Troen says. Instead, their three children inscribed the gravestones with musical notes: the opening bars of Brit Olam, or ""Everlasting Covenant,"" a classic Israeli love song that Deborah, who went by the Hebrew name Shahar, had sung with Shlomi at their own wedding. ""It's a way of saying that the years to come. . . they will not focus on the tragic,"" Troen says, ""But rather on the beauty in their lives. ""Rotem, Troen's 16-year-old grandson who survived the Oct. 7 attack, came to stay with his grandparents Ilan and Carol after he was released from the hospital. A day later, Carol was at her living room table when he screamed from the other room. ""Just screaming, 'Why? Why? Why? It's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair,'"" Carol says. ""And I screamed back, 'Why? Why? Why?' Because I had to answer him. . . I just screamed with him. ""The day I visited the Troens, their grandson was perhaps looking for answers. He was visiting his home in Kibbutz Holit for the first time since he was attacked inside it. Carol was boiling soup on the stove for her three orphaned grandkids. An Israeli warplane roared above. ""It's on its way to Gaza,"" Troen said. More than 23,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Gaza in the Israeli bombardment, according to health officials there. The war came after Hamas led an ambush on Oct. 7 that killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel, according to Israeli officials. Now the war has reached a crescendo on the world stage. Israel stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice. ""Crimes against humanity? We were defending ourselves,"" Troen says. ""This isn't vengeance. This is protection. Self-defense. ""His daughter Deborah believed in the possibility of peace with her neighbors. She sent her children to Hagar, a rare elementary school in Israel's south, where Jewish and Arab kids study together. I asked Troen what his daughter might think about the way Israel is waging its war in Gaza and its high human toll. ""I think she would be appalled and concerned, maybe angry, but maybe she would understand,"" he says. ""If you know of a better way, kindly tell us, what (is) the better, cleaner, nicer way of dealing with the kind of threat that we have to face, that has continually risen to achieve its ultimate divinely-inspired and commanded goal of exterminating us. ""There's something else Troen has thought about more deeply since the October 7th attack: Israel's control over Palestinian lives. His city, Omer, is close to the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and less than 30 miles from the Gaza Strip. ""The capacity of one nation, however powerful it is, to totally suppress a movement of popular resistance that is deeply rooted in the population is not a very good record,"" Troen says. ""Palestinians are going to need to obtain what they so desperately want, which is what we so desperately want, which is a state of our own. ""Troen calls it an older insight, previously more abstract to him, that became more pertinent after Oct. 7 and the days since. ""It's so palpable and visible,"" he says. ""You're sitting in my house today, which is a 45-second distance in flight time from Gaza by a missile. We could go downstairs, and I could take you to my bomb shelter — 16 inches of reinforced concrete. ""Those are the measurements of an intolerable state of conflict, alongside the immeasurable losses Troen's family, and so many others, have endured these last 100 days.",npr_articles/article_90.txt,npr_results/article_90.txt.json
91,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/14/1224673502/gaza-numbers-100-days-israel-hamas,"The numbers that capture the state of Gaza after 100 days of war are staggering: Nearly 2 million displaced, thousands of homes destroyed and nearly 24,000 dead — 10,000 of them children. Since the outbreak of war on Oct. 7, when the militant group Hamas broke into southern Israel and killed 1,200 people and kidnapped some 250 more, the toll of Israel's response on Gaza, which is governed by Hamas, has been catastrophic for the territory. ""What we have seen since 7 October is a stain on our collective conscience. Unless we act, it will become an indelible mark on our humanity. People will continue to suffer and die from the rockets, the bombs, the missiles and the bullets; and in increasing numbers from starvation, disease and exposure,"" the United Nations humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said Friday.  The death toll, updated regularly by the Palestinian Ministry of Health, does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. But about 70% of the dead are women and children, the ministry says. About 10,000 of the dead are children under the age of 18. Nearly 8,000 more are reported to be missing, presumed dead under rubble. In other words, more than 1% of Gaza's pre-war population of 2. 3 million have been killed in just over three months of conflict. The health ministry also tracks injuries. Hospitals have reported catastrophic injuries caused by airstrikes, including severe, full-body burns and crushed limbs. About 1,000 children have lost one or both legs, the aid group Save The Children said this week. ""An entire generation of children is traumatized and will take years to heal. Thousands have been killed, maimed, and orphaned. Hundreds of thousands are deprived of education. Their future is in jeopardy, with far-reaching and long-lasting consequences,"" said Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UNRWA, the U. N. agency in Gaza, in a statement Saturday. About 85% of Gaza's population have been forced out of their homes to flee conflict in the largest displacement of Palestinian people since the wars that surrounded the founding of Israel in 1948, UNRWA says.  Many families have now been displaced more than once. Israel's ground operations initially focused in the northern part of the territory, and ahead of its ground invasion in October, Israel had urged Palestinians in Gaza City to evacuate to the south. But its airstrikes have repeatedly pummeled the south, too. Over the past month, Israel's ground operations have refocused on cities in central and southern Gaza, including Khan Younis, forcing Palestinians to flee once again. Now, an estimated 1. 3 million people have crowded into Rafah, the city closest to Gaza's southern border with Egypt. ""We don't know where to go or what to do. We're going from spot to spot,"" said a man who called himself Abu Ibrahim Sharran, as he rode a bicycle loaded with a sleeping mat and clothes on the streets of Khan Younis earlier this month. His family had already evacuated twice, he said, and he was looking for yet another place to stay. ""May God provide relief for everyone, so that people will be able to return to their homes, instead of sitting scattered on the streets. ""The scale of destruction is beyond a scale ever seen in Gaza, especially in Gaza City, which has drawn comparisons to the worst bombardments of world conflicts in recent history, including Mariupol in Ukraine and Aleppo in Syria. Perhaps the best estimate of the scale of destruction comes from satellite imagery. According to an analysis of satellite imagery by researchers at Oregon State University and the City University of New York, as many as 55. 9% of all buildings in the Gaza Strip have been damaged or destroyed by Israel's bombardment, or up to 160,800 buildings. In northern Gaza, where most of the territory's residents lived before the war, the numbers are even higher: Researchers estimate that up to 80% or more of buildings have been damaged or destroyed. The World Health Organization reports that less than half of the hospitals in Gaza are operating at any capacity. And at those that are operational, bed capacity is estimated to be at 351%, the WHO reports — in other words, hospitals in Gaza are treating more than three times the number of patients for which they are equipped. Hospitals and medical staff in Gaza have reported shortages of practically everything needed to treat the massive number of wounded and sick. Medical supplies of all kinds are in short supply, including antibiotics, first aid supplies, IV fluids and blood. Electricity has been a major challenge for hospitals since Gaza's main power plant went offline early in the war; hospitals have been desperate for fuel to operate generators needed to power ventilators, incubators and other health equipment reliant on electricity. ""There are no beds available, so people are literally just on the ground, seeking treatment. There's not really room or space for us to breathe or think,"" said Dr. Seema Jilani, an American doctor who spoke to NPR after two weeks working at Gaza's al-Aqsa Hospital as part of a team from the International Rescue Committee. More than 600 healthcare workers have died in attacks and nearly 800 more have been injured, according to the WHO. Dozens of ambulances have been damaged. Additional reporting by Anas Baba in Rafah.

92,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/14/1224425997/israel-gaza-hamas-war-100-days,"TEL AVIV, Israel — In the 100 days since Oct. 7, the day that fighters from the militant group Hamas burst across Israel's southern border, Israeli officials have vowed not to stop fighting until Hamas has been destroyed. The attackers killed 1,200 people and took about 240 individuals hostage, according to Israel — shaking the country's sense of security to its core. Israel's military response, with an air, ground and sea assault on Gaza, has killed more than 23,900 Palestinians, health officials in Gaza say, and has left much of the territory in ruins. In more than three months of war, there are some signs that Israel has made progress toward reaching its stated goals. Its military says it has killed Hamas officials and thousands of fighters. It has seized and destroyed Hamas military infrastructure, including rocket launchers, operations centers and a lot of its underground tunnel network. But on other counts, military analysts say, Israel has failed to accomplish what it set out to do. It has not yet captured or killed Hamas leaders like Yahya Sinwar, the group's top official in Gaza. It has been unable to secure the release of more than 100 hostages still alive in captivity. And the civilian death toll in Gaza has brought Israel broad international criticism and pressure, including from the Biden administration. Analysts warn that the war could get even more dangerous for the people of Gaza, even as concerns grow about risks that the war could spill over into a wider regional conflict with other countries. Without a clear exit strategy, Israel's ""broader strategic goal"" — the eradication of Hamas — may be impossible to achieve, said Dan Byman, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Its success ""will depend in part on destroying Hamas' military force, but also in part on ensuring that whatever [leadership in Gaza] comes in next has some legitimacy, has some ability to function,"" he said. A lot of Israel's military attention and public comments have focused on the vast network of tunnels snaking under Gaza that Israeli military officials have dubbed ""the Metro. ""Israel estimates the passageways and shafts run as many as 300 miles through the enclave. Since Israeli ground troops secured the area around Erez, the border crossing from north Gaza into Israel, military officials have frequently shown off their biggest ""Metro"" trophy, claiming it to be the largest and most complex tunnel Hamas built. On a day in late December, Israeli military spokesperson Maj. Doron Spielman led a dozen journalists through a section of what was once the concrete barrier that separated Israel and Gaza. It was blown out by Hamas fighters on Oct. 7, making it possible to step directly onto Gaza's sandy soil, as drones buzzed overhead. What seemed to be a rusty drainage pipe jutting out of a sand dune was, in fact, the opening of Hamas' largest ""single subway tunnel,"" Spielman said. Just a few hundred feet from the border crossing, an initial steep climb down rickety metal grates led to a large concrete tunnel, complete with wiring and ventilation, that snaked past two armed soldiers and disappeared into the dark. The tunnel, nearly 2 1/2 miles long, was lined with shafts leading even farther underground to command centers, where fighters from Hamas were ""storing weapons, going through maps and planning their attacks,"" Spielman said. Military officials say they found a video showing Muhammad Sinwar, brother of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, driving a car through the tunnel. Spielman says cars drove all the way to and from Gaza City. In total, Israel says there are hundreds of miles of tunnels throughout Gaza, including underneath sensitive civilian infrastructure like hospitals and refugee camps. ""Hamas has persistently and deliberately invested enormous amounts of money and resources into terrorist tunnels that serve only one purpose: attacking the state of Israel and its residents,"" said Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, another military spokesperson, in December. ""For Hamas, attacking the people of Israel continues to take priority over supporting the people of Gaza. ""Israel's effort to dismantle Hamas' tunnel network and other military infrastructure has relied on airstrikes that have killed and injured civilians and have left Gaza City in ruins. Palestinian officials say some 70% of the dead are women and children. When asked about the high death toll from Israeli airstrikes, Spielman said the only way to dismantle and clean out the tunnels is for the air campaigns to make it safe for Israeli soldiers on the ground. ""We would love to have a better way. I know we don't want to kill civilians, and they are a very unfortunate consequence of Hamas having spent so many years building under their feet,"" he said. ""If anyone has a better idea, I think we would love to hear it. ""Palestinians living in Gaza say Israel's campaign has disproportionately harmed civilians. ""Go underground and fight Hamas,"" said Mohammad Hamdan, 30, as he cleaned up rubble after an Israeli airstrike that leveled his neighbor's home and left several dead. ""We are not Hamas. They are not dying. The people are. ""There have been growing international calls for a cease-fire, and the Biden administration has urged Israel to curtail the intensity of the operations in Gaza. But Israel's leaders have vowed to push on, insisting a military victory can be achieved. Evidence of that so far is mixed, military analysts told NPR. Byman, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he believes Israel is winning the war, but adds many caveats. Though it has destroyed many Hamas tunnels, Israel has also discovered how much the underground network has grown since Israel withdrew from its occupation of Gaza nearly 20 years ago, he said. Israel also claims to have killed many top Hamas commanders and as many as 8,000 Hamas fighters. Officials in Gaza do not distinguish between combatant and civilian casualties when reporting death tolls. Israeli forces have also taken losses. Since the start of their ground operation in Gaza in October, at least 186 soldiers have been killed and 1,085 injured, according to the Israeli military. ""Hamas continues to retain the majority of its fighters. It continues to retain a significant military capacity. But after several months of fighting, Israel has made a dent in it,"" Byman said. But Byman also warned caution about Israel's claims, including how it defines combatants. ""When Israeli forces go into a neighborhood, do young men of fighting age pick up weapons? And does that count as a Hamas fighter or not?"" Byman said. Estimates of Hamas troop levels before the war range from 15,000 to as high as 40,000 fighters, analysts told NPR. If Israel's death toll for Hamas fighters is to be believed, anywhere from half to 80% of Hamas' forces could remain on the ground, said Samir Ghattas of the Middle East Forum for Strategic Studies and National Security in Cairo. But such estimates and death tolls cannot be relied upon, he added. ""We can say that the statements from both sides have been exaggerated,"" Ghattas said. Israel was able to quickly assert military control over northern Gaza and rocket fire from Gaza has slowed dramatically in recent weeks, he noted. Ghattas estimated that although the Hamas artillery and ammunition stockpiles may be running low, they are still plentiful, ""with military capability to fight for one or two more months, well into February. ""What is left of Israel's goals may be tougher to accomplish — and more destructive for Palestinians in Gaza, analysts say. Israeli officials say they have now entered a new phase of the war, withdrawing some troops from northern Gaza. The battleground has shifted to cities in the south, which were already teeming with displaced Palestinians, forced from their homes by Israel. More than a million Palestinians are now living in the southern city of Rafah, after Israel pushed residents out of the north. Before the war, Rafah was home to about 275,000 people. As Gaza's residents pack into ever more crowded areas, Hamas fighters could embed more deeply into the population, said Ahron Bregman, who teaches at the Department of War Studies at King's College London. Ultimately, militants could break up into smaller insurgent groups that would be harder for Israel to hunt and kill, he said. ""They are better trained, the Israelis, in fighting regular armies than fighting insurgencies. And they will find it very difficult, the Israelis, if they do stay in the Gaza Strip, to do counterinsurgency,"" he said. Israeli officials have repeatedly promised to ""dismantle"" Hamas. But rooting out the last of the militant group will be difficult, if not impossible, said James Rands, a military analyst with Janes, a defense intelligence company. ""The problem is that there are 2. 2 million civilians in the Gaza Strip and you can't just keep moving them around indefinitely, so that final blow against Hamas to destroy them probably isn't going to be feasible,"" he said. The only way to end an insurgency is to offer people hope for a better future, Rands said. A long-term Israeli occupation of Gaza is widely opposed by U. S. and Israeli officials as well as Palestinians in Gaza, many of whom can no longer envision peaceful coexistence with Israel after more than three months of airstrikes. Israel's military leaders have signaled they expect to remain fighting in Gaza through 2024. But their effort to end Hamas' rule in Gaza must come with a plan for what comes next, said Byman. ""The political side can't be separated from the military, and in my view Israel has focused much less on the political side than the military side,"" he said.",npr_articles/article_92.txt,npr_results/article_92.txt.json

The Houthis have ignored two previous ultimatums from the U. S. and other countries and continued their attacks in the region. More than 2,000 ships have had to divert their course to avoid the Red Sea, which is going to cause delays in international shipping for consumers.

The case is being heard before the United Nations' International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands. The court's 15 judges were joined by one judge each from South Africa and Israel. In nearly three hours of testimony, lawyers and experts on behalf of South Africa presented evidence arguing that Israel's three-month-long military campaign in Gaza has gone beyond a war with Hamas — the Palestinian militant group that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages, according to Israel. The South African legal team argued Israel's offensive now includes all 2 million Palestinians who reside in Gaza. ""The level of Israel's killing is so extensive that nowhere is safe in Gaza,"" South African lawyer Adila Hassim said to the court. ""As I stand before you today, 23,210 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces during the sustained attacks over the last three months,"" said Hassim, ""at least 70% of whom are believed to be women and children. ""Hassim said the Israeli military dropped 6,000 bombs a week on Gaza in the first three weeks of its campaign and dropped 2,000-pound bombs onto areas declared safe by Israel, including refugee camps. As a result, she said, more than 1,800 families in Gaza have lost multiple family members, and 85% of all Gazans have been forced to flee their homes. ""This killing is nothing short of destruction of Palestinian life,"" Hassim said. ""It is inflicted deliberately. No one is spared. Not even newborn babies. The scale of Palestinian child killings in Gaza is such that U. N. chiefs have described it as a 'graveyard for children. ' ""South Africa's delegation insisted that genocidal intent is shown not only by the way Israel has launched its military campaign, but by comments from leaders like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In late October in an address to Israeli forces, Netanyahu invoked the story of Amalek, a figure in the Hebrew Bible who tried to destroy the Jewish people. ""This refers to the biblical command by God to Saul of the retaliatory destruction of an entire group of people,"" said South African legal scholar Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, who said Netanyahu's reference was meant to justify genocide. Netanyahu responded swiftly to South Africa's testimony. ""The hypocrisy of South Africa knows no bounds,"" he said in a video statement immediately following the first day of testimony in The Hague. ""The state of Israel is accused of genocide at a time when it is fighting genocide. ""In Israel's opening arguments before the court on Friday, Israeli lawyer Tal Becker said Israel is ""singularly aware"" of why the Genocide Convention was adopted, referring to the systematic murder of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust, which gave birth to the convention invoked in these proceedings. ""The applicant has now sought to invoke this term in the context of Israel's conduct in a war it did not start and did not want,"" Becker said, ""a war in which Israel is defending itself against Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other terrorist organizations whose brutality knows no bounds. ""Becker told the court that South Africa's case hinges on a ""deliberately curated, decontextualized and manipulative description of the reality of current hostilities,"" and that it intentionally ignored the role of Hamas in Israel's military response. ""The applicant's submissions sounded barely distinguishable from Hamas' own rejectionist rhetoric,"" Becker said of South Africa's case. Becker told the court that if Hamas surrenders and releases its hostages, Israel's hostilities against the group would end. The Israeli presentation acknowledged the suffering of civilians in Gaza, but argued it has no genocidal intent. The civilian toll, Israel argued, is the consequence of Hamas' practice of waging war among noncombatants. ""The court is also told of the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza,"" he added, ""but it is not told of Hamas' practice of stealing and hoarding aid; it is not told of the extensive Israeli efforts to mitigate civilian harm, of the humanitarian initiatives being undertaken to enable the flow of supplies and provide medical attention to the wounded. ""A ruling may not come for years. On Thursday, South Africa devoted much of its three-hour testimony to persuading the court to issue a provisional ruling, similar to an emergency injunction, whereby the court could direct Israel to stop its military campaign in Gaza and allow more aid to reach Palestinians. Any such provisional ruling could come within weeks, but it's unclear whether Israel would follow any such ruling. In research of International Court of Justice provisional rulings over the years, legal scholar Matei Alexianu has found that states comply with rulings in just half of all provisional rulings. Alexianu points out, though, that there are indirect effects. ""They declare certain values of the international order,"" said Alexianu, ""It is valuable for other states and for the world community in general to have those values and those obligations reaffirmed in the long term. ""Alexianu says if a state refuses to comply with provisional rulings from the court, it reminds the rest of the world which side of that international order they're on, and it can have long-term consequences for that state.",npr_articles/article_96.txt,npr_results/article_96.txt.json
97,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/12/1224360624/israel-defends-itself-at-the-u-n-s-top-court-against-allegations-of-genocide,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands — Accused of committing genocide against Palestinians, Israel defended its war in Gaza at the United Nations' highest court Friday, a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blasted the allegations as hypocrisy that ""screams to the heavens. ""Israel, which was founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust, has vehemently denied the accusations brought by South Africa in one of the biggest cases ever to come before an international court, one that has drawn international attention and protesters from both sides to the courthouse. South African lawyers asked the court Thursday to order an immediate halt to Israeli military operations in the besieged coastal territory that is home to 2. 3 million Palestinians. A decision on that request will probably take weeks, though the full case is likely to last years. ""We live at a time when words are cheap in an age of social media and identity politics. The temptation to reach for the most outrageous term to vilify and demonize has become, for many, irresistible,"" Israeli legal advisor Tal Becker told a packed auditorium at the ornate Palace of Peace in The Hague. He added that South Africa ""has regrettably put before the court a profoundly distorted, factual and legal picture. The entirety of its case hinges on a deliberately curated, decontextualized and manipulative description of the reality of current hostilities. ""Israel often boycotts international tribunals and U. N. investigations, saying they are unfair and biased. But, in a sign of how seriously they regard the case, Israeli leaders have taken the rare step of sending a high-level legal team. At the heart of the case are Israel's actions in Gaza, where it launched a massive air and ground assault after Hamas militants crossed into Israel on Oct. 7, storming through communities and killing some 1,200 people, mainly civilians. The assailants also abducted around 250 people, over half of whom are still held captive. More than 23,000 people in Gaza have been killed during the military campaign, according to the the Health Ministry in the territory, which is run by Hamas. Nearly 85% of Gaza's people have been driven their homes, a quarter of the territory's residents face starvation, and much of northern Gaza has been reduced to rubble. South Africa says this amounts to genocide and is part of decades of Israeli oppression of Palestinians. ""The scale of destruction in Gaza, the targeting of family homes and civilians, the war being a war on children — all make clear that genocidal intent is both understood and has been put into practice. The articulated intent is the destruction of Palestinian life,"" lawyer Tembeka Ngcukaitobi said in opening statements Thursday. The case's ""distinctive feature"" was ""the reiteration and repetition of genocidal speech throughout every sphere of the state in Israel,"" he said. Netanyahu dismissed those arguments. ""This is an upside-down world — the state of Israel is accused of genocide while it is fighting genocide,"" the prime minister said Thursday in a video statement. ""The hypocrisy of South Africa screams to the heavens. ""Instead Israel says it is acting in legitimate self-defense. International agreements still bind countries to the rules of war, even when responding to an attack, no matter how serious, and the court must decide if Israel's operations have indeed remained within those strictures. Although the court's findings are considered binding, it was unclear whether Israel would heed any order to halt the fighting. If it doesn't, it could face U. N. sanctions, although those may be blocked by a veto from the United States, Israel's staunch ally. The White House declined to comment on how it might respond if the court determines Israel committed genocide. But National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby called the allegations ""unfounded. ""The extraordinary case goes to the core of one of the world's most intractable conflicts — and for the second day protesters rallied outside the court. Pro-Israeli demonstrators set up a table near the court grounds for a Sabbath meal with empty seats commemorating the hostages still being held by Hamas. Nearby, over 100 pro-Palestinian protesters waved flags and shouted protests. The case strikes at the heart of Israel's national identity, which is rooted in the country's creation as a Jewish state after the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews during World War II. Israel says it is battling a fierce enemy that carried out the deadliest attack on its territory since the country was founded in 1948. Its leaders insist they are following international law and doing their utmost to avoid harm to civilians. Israel blames Hamas for the high death toll, saying the militants operate in residential areas. The case also evokes issues central to South Africa's own identity: Its governing party, the African National Congress, has long compared Israel's policies in Gaza and the West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Black people to ""homelands"" before ending in 1994. South Africa sought to broaden the case beyond the Israel-Hamas war. ""The violence and the destruction in Palestine and Israel did not begin on Oct. 7, 2023. The Palestinians have experienced systematic oppression and violence for the last 76 years,"" said South African Justice Minister Ronald Lamola. ""Mothers, fathers, children, siblings, grandparents, aunts, cousins are often all killed together. This killing is nothing short of destruction of Palestinian life. It is inflicted deliberately. No one is spared. Not even newborn babies,"" said South African lawyer Hassim. About two-thirds of the dead in Gaza are women and children, according to health officials there. The death toll does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The world court, which rules on disputes between nations, has never judged a country to be responsible for genocide. The closest it came was in 2007, when it ruled that Serbia ""violated the obligation to prevent genocide"" in the July 1995 massacre by Bosnian Serb forces of more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the Bosnian enclave of Srebrenica.",npr_articles/article_97.txt,npr_results/article_97.txt.json
98,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/12/1223677088/israel-gaza-war-tech-economic-toll,"TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli army has announced that it is pulling thousands of troops out of Gaza and sending them home to their families and jobs. The reasons go beyond battlefield tactics. ""This will significantly ease the burden on the economy and allow them to gather strength for the upcoming activities,"" said Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, ""as the fighting will continue and they will still be required. ""It's a reminder of the war's heavy economic toll — not only in Gaza, where it has been devastating, but also in Israel, the most developed economy in the Middle East. Analysts say the war has caused the economy to shrink and created a labor shortage. Raz, 29, is an upbeat software engineer who works in a key engine of the Israeli economy, the tech sector. He's also a member of the Israeli army's special forces reserves. Early on in the war, Raz was at his base within a few miles of the border with Gaza preparing for a mission, while simultaneously talking on his phone with an overseas customer about a software project. ""I had to juggle between those two,"" recalls Raz, sitting in his company's glass-walled office with a view of the Mediterranean Sea in the distance. ""I remember it being super, super hard. ""Israeli aircraft were firing guns overhead while Raz was talking business with a client. ""One of the customers asked, 'What's this noise?' and I had to explain that this is shooting sounds,"" Raz recalls. Raz, whose unit forbids him from giving his full name for security reasons, has spent the last three months splitting his time among military missions, training and developing software. ""Being a soldier is harder than being a software engineer,"" he says matter-of-factly. But, he adds, ""I also think that preserving the high-tech sector in Israel is a very important mission. ""Israel is home to one of the world's top tech sectors. The country's best-known tech products include Waze, the driving directions app. High technology is also Israel's most productive sector. It employs about 12% of the workforce, and it accounts for 18% of gross domestic product and half of the country's exports, according to the Israel Innovation Authority, a government agency that supports the sector's development. Tens of thousands of Israeli tech workers like Raz are also reservists who have been called up since the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, which means tech has faced a major labor shortage in recent months. The firms hold the reservists' jobs open, waiting for their return. At the beginning of the war, the Israeli army said it was mobilizing 360,000 reservists — more than it has for any previous war this century. The Bank of Israel estimates the economy shrank by 2% in the final three months of 2023, and it expects the war to cost about $58 billion. ""While it's common to talk about the international pressure that's increasing on Israel to reach a cease-fire,"" says Dan Ben-David, who teaches economics at Tel Aviv University, ""there is also going to be increasing internal pressure by people who need to work. ""Rami Ben Efraim, a retired air force general and tech firm owner, has felt the labor pinch, though he says his business remains resilient. More than half the workers at Planet Nine, one of his tech companies, are reservists. That includes the firm's chief operating officer, who flies an F-16, leading a group on bombing missions and close air support. Ben Efraim says when the war started, his message to his chief operating officer was simple: ""Just go to the air force. . . . I'll call you once a week. I'll tell you what is happening here. You don't have any tasks. ""Another of Ben Efraim's employees serves in a cyber unit, splitting his seven-day workweek between the company and the military, including night shifts. ""I'm just trying to make sure that they're not exhausted,"" Ben Efraim says. ""I'm telling them . . . the military is more important than us right now. If you have some extra time, please come and help us here. ""Ben Efraim's company has had to push back some projects, but his firm focuses on applied R&D projects in cyber and artificial intelligence, so demand remains robust regardless of the war. Tech companies have managed the labor shortage by hiring new employees and subcontracting some work to other firms at home and abroad. Things are much harder for newer companies. The war has spooked some foreign investors, and hundreds of early-stage startups have not been able to access the investment they need to keep operating. Dror Bin, who runs the Israel Innovation Authority, says it is offering a total of $100 million in funding to help keep them afloat as part of a new government program started after Oct. 7. ""If the company is successful, they will pay us back the loan as a royalty from their revenues,"" he says. ""If they fail, the money is gone. ""The war is just the latest drag on tech investment. Last January, the government launched plans to reform the country's judiciary, which many Israelis saw as an attempt to undermine democracy. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets. Foreign investors worried about the country's rule of law. ""Founders that started companies were told by their investors that they should form the companies outside of Israel, because if Israel has no independent court system, then you want the companies to be incorporated elsewhere,"" says Gigi Levy-Weiss, a leading tech venture capitalist based in Tel Aviv. Instead of launching 1,300 or 1,400 new companies annually, as it typically does, Israel's tech sector formed only about 400 last year, Levy-Weiss says. He adds that this is about the same number per year as Israel's tech sector produced two decades ago. In the wake of the Oct. 7 attack, which Israel says killed more than 1,200 people, and the subsequent war in Gaza, where Israel's offensive has killed more than 23,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, the Israeli government says it has shelved its judicial reform plans — for now. Tech leaders are bullish on the sector's resilience and say bursts of innovation tend to follow wars here, but Levy-Weiss still has concerns. ""I worry that unless we create full certainty, many investors that loved investing in Israel are going to say, 'I need to see for a second what's happening,'"" Levy-Weiss says. ""'I need to see that the war is really over. I need to see that there's a solution for Gaza. I need to see that there isn't a [judicial] reform anymore. '""As for Raz, the software engineer, the army released him from reserve duty this month. He's moving to Southeast Asia and is excited about a new job as a project manager. He'll still be with an Israeli company but now back to working full time. Eve Guterman contributed to this report in Tel Aviv, Israel.",npr_articles/article_98.txt,npr_results/article_98.txt.json
99,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/11/1223238786/us-strikes-houthis-yemen,"The United States and Britain launched strikes on about a dozen Houthi militant targets in Yemen, according to a U. S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The strikes follow more than two months of attacks by the Houthis against international cargo ships and U. S. warships in the Red Sea, expanding a Middle East conflict U. S. officials have worked hard to contain. In a written statement, President Biden stressed that the joint attacks were a defensive response to Houthi actions, and had the support of Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands. ""These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world's most critical commercial routes,"" Biden said. ""I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary. ""The defense official told NPR the strikes were carried out using surface ships and submarines as well as Navy ship-based warplanes and Air Force attack aircraft, in addition to British aircraft. The targets include radar sites, drone launchers and drone storage sites — chosen in an effort to ""degrade"" the Houthis' ability to attack shipping. The Biden administration has been telegraphing possible retaliation against the Iranian-backed Houthi militants for days, with one senior official saying the Houthis would face ""consequences"" if the attacks continued. The official said Biden met with his national security team on New Year's Day to discuss options. Since November, the Houthis have targeted international cargo ships in the Red Sea, mounting more than two dozen drone and missile attacks. Some of the attacks have damaged ships, although U. S. warships have shot down many of the missiles and drones. On Jan. 9, the Pentagon said Houthis launched the largest attack yet, firing one-way drones, anti-ship cruise missiles and an anti-ship ballistic missile into the Southern Red Sea, toward international shipping lanes where dozens of merchant vessels were transiting. Eighteen drones and missiles were shot down by a combined effort of F-18 aircraft from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower as well as strikes from the USS Gravely, the USS Laboon, the USS Mason and the United Kingdom's HMS Diamond. It was the 26th Houthi attack on commercial shipping lanes in the Red Sea. There were no injuries or damage reported. Before that four small Houthi boats tried to attack a container ship, the Singapore-flagged Maersk Hangzhou, which officials said was either a hijacking attempt or a suicide mission. U. S. helicopters from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and USS Gravely responded, and when they took fire from the Houthi boats, opened fire, sinking three boats while the fourth one escaped. The Houthis said they lost at least 10 fighters. The U. S. attacks on Yemen soil come after some Republicans have strongly pushed for retaliation against the Houthis. Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said recently on ABC's This Week that the Biden administration must take a tougher stance against the Houthi militants. ""Well, what I think what's significant is the administration continues to not respond to the Houthi escalation in the area,"" Turner said. And Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, chided Biden. ""This is a global crisis brought on by weak presidential leadership,"" Wicker said in a news release on Jan. 4. ""It is time for President Biden to allow our regional commanders the freedom of action they need to end terrorist behavior by the Houthis. ""One former U. S. regional commander, retired Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, who served as the top officer in the Middle East, said in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece last week that it was time to act against the Houthis, and send a message to Iran. ""Tehran and its proxies are pressing their attacks because they haven't confronted steel,"" McKenzie wrote. ""The ability to stop such probing generally depends on a swift and violent counterattack. ""Now that there has been such a counterattack, what does the future hold?Behnam Ben Taleblu, who focuses on Iranian security and political issues at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, wonders whether the U. S. strikes were designed to send a message or lead to a broader assault. The Houthis — more so than other Iranian-supported groups, like the Palestinian group Hamas or Hezbollah in Lebanon — have a sophisticated arsenal of weapons provided by Iran, he says, including medium-range ballistic missiles capable of reaching southern Israel as well as an array of drones. The U. S. would have to mount a ""sustained"" campaign against the Houthi military sites, he said, if it wants to ""defang"" the group. This is not the first time the U. S. has attacked Houthi targets in Yemen. Back in 2016, the U. S. launched three cruise missiles against coastal radar sites after failed Houthi missile attacks on a U. S. destroyer. The recent and repeated Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea have led to the recent creation of a naval coalition — dubbed Prosperity Guardian — led by the U. S. and including some two dozen countries to provide security for the shipping companies. But some of the companies are still wary, bypassing the dangers of the Red Sea and instead making a longer trip around Africa to reach Europe. ""The situation is constantly evolving and remains highly volatile, and all available intelligence at hand confirms that the security risk continues to be at a significantly elevated level,"" the shipping giant Maersk said in a statement on Jan. 5. ""We have therefore decided that all Maersk vessels due to transit the Red Sea / Gulf of Aden will be diverted south around the Cape of Good Hope for the foreseeable future. ""The U. S. says the Houthi attacks are nothing more than an assault on international shipping in a waterway that hosts as much as 15% of the world's trade. Houthis counter by saying the ongoing attacks are in solidarity with Hamas militants who mounted an attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Hamas killed 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and took about 240 hostages, Israeli officials say. Israel responded with an offensive in the Gaza Strip it says is meant to destroy Hamas, which rules the territory. Israel's air, ground and sea assault has led to more than 23,000 deaths in Gaza, according to health officials there, with most of those killed women and children. Now the counterattacks on the Houthis have widened a conflict in the Middle East, that was spurred by the Hamas attack on Israel. The U. S. has urged Israel to wrap up its incursion into Gaza, or at least stop the intense bombing that has led to a large number of civilian deaths and a humanitarian catastrophe. A steady stream of U. S. officials — from Secretary of State Antony Blinken to national security adviser Jake Sullivan to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin — have all pressed for a more targeted ground campaign, protection of civilians and an increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza. But Israel has said it will continue its campaign until Hamas is defeated, with officials saying that effort could last well into this year. Even before the U. S. strikes in Yemen, the Middle East conflict was expanding. Iranian-backed militias have continued attacks on U. S. forces in Syria and Iraq, with the Pentagon logging some 120 attacks since October. A recent assault in Irbil, Iraq, left three U. S. service members wounded, one critically with a head wound from shrapnel. And after its attack on Gaza, Israel has exchanged fire with Iranian-backed Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and more recently killed a senior Hamas official in Beirut. The United States, meanwhile, killed a senior Iranian-affiliated militia leader in Baghdad, Mushtaq Talib al-Saidi, also known as Abu Taqwa, who the U. S. says was behind attacks on its forces in the country. The attack incensed some Iraqi leaders who said the killing violated its sovereignty and raised questions about ongoing U. S. presence. With the latest U. S. attack on Yemen, what will it mean for Iranian-proxies in the region? Will they increase their attacks on shipping or U. S. troops? Will Iran get more involved? Already Iran has a sent a frigate into the Red Sea. And will Yemen look to open another front — maybe against Saudi Arabia?The Saudi-backed Yemeni government and the Iran-aligned Houthis have been locked in a conflict since 2015, a fight that has killed hundreds of thousands and left some 80% of Yemen's populations dependent on humanitarian aid, according to the United Nations. Just two weeks ago, with a U. N. envoy looking on, both sides committed to taking steps toward a cease-fire.",npr_articles/article_99.txt,npr_results/article_99.txt.json
100,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2024/01/11/1224201620/another-layer-of-misery-women-in-gaza-struggle-to-find-menstrual-pads-running-wa,"Heba Usrof, a young woman in Gaza, is running out of options to deal with her menstrual cycle. Pads have disappeared from pharmacies and stores. It's been this way since the war that began in October, and it's a situation that mirrors how nearly every basic requirement — from food to medical aid — has become harder to find in Gaza over the past three months. ""We go around and around, searching in all the pharmacies for pads, but we can't find any,"" Usrof says. Ruba Akkila, whose work in Gaza before the war focused on the protection of women and children, says pads do sporadically appear on shelves, but they are five and six times their normal price when and if they are sold, putting them out of reach for most of Gaza's impoverished and now unemployed households. The lack of pads is a result of Israel's near-total siege of Gaza, which began following a deadly rampage in Israel by Hamas militants on October 7. ""We're suffering from being hungry, from being thirsty, from being bombed. We're suffering from being displaced,"" says Bisan Owda, a young woman in Gaza who's been vividly documenting her life throughout the war to her 3. 7 million followers on Instagram. ""Now, we're suffering also because there's no pads. It's just a new suffering,"" she says in a video post about this issue. The U. N. estimates that some 700,000 women and girls in Gaza experience menstrual cycles but don't have adequate access now to basic hygiene products like pads, toilet paper or even running water and toilets because of the war. These conditions put women and girls in Gaza at risk of reproductive and urinary tract infections, according to the U. N. A spokesperson for UNICEF told NPR: ""This situation is particularly challenging for women and adolescent girls, who lack safe, private and dignified places to manage menstrual hygiene. There are reports this is exacerbating mental health issues. ""Jumana Shahin, a women's rights activist in Gaza, says women's needs are being neglected because of the scale of the humanitarian crisis gripping Gaza. ""This situation is not simple. We are talking about a woman's needs,"" she said. ""This situation does not have a solution. You ask if there are alternatives. There are no alternatives. """"The situation is harder than you can imagine,"" she adds. Nevertheless, women are trying to find ways to deal with their menstrual cycles. Usrof says her friends are now taking pills that prevent their periods. She's going to start doing the same, she says. It's either that or ""drown,"", she says. ""This issue is we're moving around a lot. We don't have the luxury of sitting around and relaxing, so it's really hard,' she says, describing how most people have fled from their homes and shelters multiple times in past weeks as Israel expands its offensive. Meanwhile, not all women can find pills to block their periods or, for underlying health reasons, can take these pills. With no other choice, Akkila, the gender protection expert, says some women are turning to old clothes, towels or even the corners of their tents to use as pads. ""The only way to do it is just to do with scissors,"" she says. ""It's messy. It's terrible. And nobody speaks about it,"" Akkila says, explaining openly talking about menstrual struggles remains taboo, even in wartime. That's partly a reflection of Gaza's traditional society – and because menstruation is a sensitive and private subject everywhere in the world. Israel's bombardment and evacuation orders have displaced around 2 million people, more than 85% of Gaza's population. As a result of this mass displacement, women also have to contend with a lack of privacy and little to no access to bathrooms. Much of Gaza has no access to running water, making showers a rare luxury. The water crisis is so severe that those in apartments, where extended families are sheltering together, can only flush the toilet when necessary because every drop of water has to be carried up the stairs and rationed. Most Gazans, however, are living in overcrowded U. N. -run schools, where 400 people or more share a single bathroom. Others are living in tents and on the streets as Israeli evacuation orders push people further and further south as the Israeli military tries to dismantle Hamas tunnels and expands deeper into Gaza. Women are waking up early and lining up at hospitals to shower before water runs out for the day, Akkila says. Others are lining up at hospitals just to use the bathroom. The challenge of trying to find an available bathroom is especially difficult for pregnant women who have pressure on their bladder, and women who've just given birth and are going through weeks of postpartum bleeding. Owda, the young woman filming videos from Gaza, shared another post two weeks ago showing what the inside of a makeshift bathroom in a tent encampment in Khan Younis looks like. ""There is no water. There is nothing around them. There is no infrastructure. They're living just in a tent, and they need bathroom(s). They're humans,"" she said, speaking from a small tent that's being used as a bathroom. She pans to a garbage basket on the ground that doubles as a toilet. She shows a bucket on the ground that is used for washing. Plastic bags with people's belongings are crammed onto a makeshift wooden shelf. ""Can you imagine? This is a bathroom,"" Owda says. Life in Gaza is a struggle for survival, with more than 23,000 Palestinians killed and around 60,000 wounded, according to Gaza's health ministry. A lack of hygiene and the collapse of the health system has led to the spread of disease in overcrowded shelters, according to the World Health Organization. There's a huge spike in cases of diarrhea among young and malnourished children in Gaza, jumping from around 66 cases a day before the war to about 3,200 cases a day last month, according to the UN children's fund, UNICEF. Only a fraction of the aid that's needed is entering Gaza every day. The U. N. says everyone in Gaza is hungry and that the territory is at risk of famine, with many families already starving. The World Food Program says people in Gaza often go entire days without eating and that many adults go hungry so that children can eat. In addition, the World Health Organization says just 13 out of Gaza's 36 hospitals are partially functional, with the rest forced to shut down because of bombardment and evacuation orders. WHO and other medical aid organizations say some of these hospitals do not even have basics like anesthesia and antibiotics. As a result of these crises, aid trucks that do enter are mostly packed with food and medical aid — not necessarily with pads for women. UNICEF, the U. N. children's fund that also works closely with women and new mothers, told NPR that since the start of the war in October they've distributed more than 41,000 hygiene kits in Gaza, which include pads and other items like soap, wipes, toilet paper, detergent and diapers. Yet it's a sliver of what's needed. UNICEF says nearly 70 trucks with more of these kits and other essential items, like tents and winter clothes, have been at border crossings for weeks, waiting for Israeli checks to enter. Marie-Aure Perreaut Revial, emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, was in Gaza last month and says women were coming to one of the main health centers where the group was operating from to request birth control pills in order to block their periods because of the lack of available pads and water. ""They were asking for family planning methods so that they would not be faced with situations where they had to find water and have to choose water either to clean their children or clean themselves,"" she says. ""It's just very, very difficult to find water now in Gaza. ""That health center and the area around it in Khan Younis were ordered to evacuate by Israel last month. As a result, says Perreaut Revial, women lost their access to those pills from the clinic.",npr_articles/article_100.txt,npr_results/article_100.txt.json
101,https://www.npr.org/gaza-middle-east-al-aqsa-hospital-israel-palestinians-doctor,"Very few people are allowed to enter Gaza right now. Dr. Seema Jilani, an American, is one of them. She spent two weeks working at a hospital there and witnessed horrors play out before her. She recorded voice memos in between treating patients and shared them with NPR. And a warning: The descriptions that follow from those voice memos, and from her interview with NPR on Wednesday, include graphic scenes of violence and suffering. It's been nearly 100 days since the deadly Hamas attack on Israel, which prompted Israel's ongoing bombardment of Gaza. Israel says it aims to destroy Hamas. By Palestinian officials' tally, more than 23,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, and about one in every 40 people there have been wounded in just three months. Israel's military is now pushing deeper into central Gaza, and says Hamas uses hospitals as command centers. The World Health Organization says the most important hospital in central Gaza is al-Aqsa. ""I've seen a lot, and I never compare conflicts, but that's got to be the most nightmarish thing I've ever seen. And the most, one of the most, inhumane and cruel things I'll ever see,"" Jilani says in a voice memo about an 11-year-old girl in the emergency room at al-Aqsa who was severely burned in an explosive blast. ""To look at her, [there] was an infinite waterfall of pain coming out from her. It's the stuff of nightmares. ""Jilani worked in the emergency room for two weeks with the International Rescue Committee, in partnership with Medical Aid for Palestinians, bearing witness to agony again and again. ""Children lying on the ground, double amputation on one child,"" she says in one recording. ""And there are no beds available, so people are literally just on the ground seeking treatment. There's not really room or space for us to breathe or think. And then there's one, two, three, four . . . six children in my line of sight right now from the corner that need medical attention urgently. One of whom is crying, a little boy around six or seven years old, wiping his tears. ""Jilani describes a hospital on the brink of collapse, including 500 patients arriving in just one night. And those patients were showing up at a facility desperate for supplies. She had no morphine or portable oxygen to give people. ""I've always told myself, there's not much we can do in medicine, but we can treat pain. And it's no longer true anymore,"" Jilani says. ""So we cannot even offer any comfort here. There is no death with dignity when you're lying on the ground of an emergency room in Gaza. ""All of this is playing out while the hospital is surrounded by bombing and gunfire. Now Doctors Without Borders and the International Rescue Committee have evacuated medical personnel from al-Aqsa hospital because of increasing Israeli attacks in the area and evacuation notices to neighborhoods there. The United Nations reports that just three doctors remain to treat hundreds of patients. Jilani spoke with All Things Considered host Ari Shapiro on Wednesday from Cairo about what she witnessed. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Ari Shapiro: I imagine that when you recorded those voice memos, you were very focused on the tasks right in front of you. And so what's it like to hear them now in a place where you have a little more room to think and breathe?Dr. Seema Jilani: It feels that my mind, my heart and my spirit is still in Gaza, and my body is somehow in Cairo, and then we'll continue onwards to where I call home. And it feels inherently wrong that I'm allowed that privilege and others are not because of the luck of where I was born. Shapiro: You've worked in many conflict areas: Afghanistan, Lebanon, Gaza in 2015 right after the Israeli ground invasion. And we heard you describe this experience as the most nightmarish. How is it different from other wars where you have worked as a pediatrician, as a doctor?Jilani: You know, as a pediatrician, I didn't think I would be very useful. Because this is war, and in war I would imagine and think that the victims or the war-wounded or the killed would be predominantly young men. I can say that on one day in our code resuscitation room, out of our five patients, four were children. And I'm very sad and deeply disturbed to say that I was very useful as a pediatrician in a warzone. And that should never be the case. The second way in which I find it extremely different is that in war we often talk of the fall of cities — the fall of Mosul, the fall of Saigon — and somehow I wonder when it was normalized that we are now speaking of the fall of hospitals — the fall of Al-Shifa, and now the fall of al-Aqsa hospital — crescendoing all the way south to Rafah. And we expect it, and we're now giving deadlines to when we anticipate the next fall of the next hospital as it rams its way through Nasser and perhaps European Gaza hospital. And we're continuing to watch the landslide as voyeuristic onlookers to grief. Shapiro: Can I ask you about one patient who you told us about in a voice memo. You explained he was a man in his early 20s, who worked for the U. N. , he was brought in still wearing his vest with the logo of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. And both of his legs were severed. You couldn't offer him morphine, and it was clear that he was dying. So you took a little piece of gauze and wiped the blood from his eyes and gave him some water. Here's what you told us in the voice memo:""The way he just calmed down when I was just putting water to his lips, told me everything I needed to know. His ask was so his little, was so tiny, and that's all he needed. He just needed some comfort, someone to bear witness, someone to say, ""Yes, you're in pain. "" Someone to say, 'This is not OK. ' Someone to help clean him up and make him feel like a human being. ""You said the best you could offer him was a quiet place to die, but in al-Aqsa hospital, you couldn't even provide that. What does that experience with that one man say about the situation across Gaza right now?Jilani: All he had when he died was my hand in his hand. And the only comfort I could provide him was wetting his lips with some makeshift gauze and some salty water, which was actually saline, which we usually put into IVs. I think it's a testament to how we have failed the people of Gaza. And I only wish I could do more. But the way that he reached up and shifted his neck as I stroked his hair, just the human connection there I'll never forget, and it will be one of the most rewarding memories I will take with me. That no, I wasn't able to give him what he deserved. I was able to stroke his forehead with a wet washcloth, whisper some words of calm, maybe a little sweetness, get some wetness of water on his tongue as he lifted his head to meet my fingers. And none of those interventions are morphine. And at the end of the day, he died on the floor of a Gaza emergency room with little more than my hand in his. Listen to All Things Considered each day here or on your local member station for more interviews like this. Shapiro: There was one detail from the voice memos you sent us that stuck with me. And I'd like to play this for you:""I'm questioning how much of a difference am I really making. It's such a proverbial drop in the ocean of blood. Yesterday, I noticed — there are a lot of flies here — and there was a fly that had drowned in the blood of a patient. And I just thought, wow, it's just literally a river of blood here. It's so much that insects are drowning in the blood of my patients. ""Can you speak to what medical professionals are actually able to do in the hospital in that horrific situation? I mean, is a doctor in an overcrowded hospital with no morphine, no gauze, an ongoing bombardment, actually able to make a difference to patients?Jilani: I believe so. I believe it means something when I'm holding a gentleman's hand and he's dying and he's looking at me in the eyes. And I think that's worth something, otherwise I wouldn't be doing this. And I think it means something to the doctors there to see us in solidarity with them. Gaza is a space that is hyper aware of the political situation outside and the forces that exist outside of it, and they feel forgotten. And the moment they see someone standing with them and offering support to them, not even in a material way — in a symbolic way to say, ""We are here to see your patience while you mourn the death of your friend or your family member"" — it means something. And it certainly means something to me. And I think it's worth holding space for that, however little that feels. Some of those things are intangible, but they're not intangible to the ones that are feeling it, that are soaking blood through their clothes. They're not intangible to the mothers that are having to bury their children. And they're not intangible to the orphans whose heads I've held in my hand. Shapiro: If you're able to go back, will you?Jilani: Absolutely. Unquestionably. Shapiro: You say that so unequivocally. Tell me more. Jilani: I've been anchored in this conflict for over 18 to 19 years. The people of Gaza occupy a place in my heart. Their resilience, their incredible ability and tenderness, their invulnerability that they are able to tap into. Every time I go there, I feel that I learn more than I give. I am completely blessed and grateful to know the people that I have gotten to know there as part of the staff and my patients and the nurses. And I will take lessons from each of those people and hope to bring them to my profession, to my family and show them this is how a life well lived, this is what it looks like.",npr_articles/article_101.txt,npr_results/article_101.txt.json
102,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/11/1223636086/israel-hamas-war-gaza-victory,"TEL AVIV, Israel — What will it take for Israel to declare mission accomplished in Gaza and end the war?Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised Israeli citizens that the military offensive in Gaza will press on until reaching a ""definitive victory over Hamas"" following its deadly Oct. 7 attack that killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel. But skepticism is growing in Israel about the kind of military victory that can really be achieved. Almost 100 days of Israel's air-and-ground offensive have destroyed much of the Gaza Strip and killed more than 23,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry. The Israeli military says its troops have killed and arrested thousands of militants, rounded up weapons and destroyed Hamas rocket launchers and tunnels. But the Palestinian militant group is still killing Israeli ground troops, firing rockets at Israel and holding more than 130 hostages captured on Oct. 7. ""There is no way this will end when Israel can say we are victorious,"" says Eyal Hulata, who was Israel's national security adviser from 2021-2023. ""Israel lost this war [on] the 7th of October. The only question now is if we are able to remove from Hamas the ability to do this again. And we might succeed, and we might not. ""The most prominent group of Israelis pushing to change Israel's war strategy is made up of citizens whose relatives were taken hostage by militants. Israel's government says the military campaign will pressure Hamas to eventually free more than 130 remaining hostages in Gaza. Families of hostages are among the voices from Israel's center-left calling to put combat on hold and strike an immediate deal with Hamas to free the hostages. A similar deal in late November freed some Israeli hostages and Palestinian detainees. In recent weeks, the Israeli families and their supporters have blocked the entrance to Israel's military headquarters in downtown Tel Aviv for several minutes once every hour, holding signs while one holds up a megaphone and reads out the names of hostages still held in Gaza. One of the relatives protesting is Udi Goren, whose cousin, Tal Chaimi, was killed in the Oct. 7 attack; Chaimi's body is being held in Gaza. ""The slogan of destroying Hamas, it's an empty slogan,"" Goren told NPR. He cited Hamas' extensive network of tunnels and ranks of fighters still remaining. ""We're talking about a war that's now going on in an urban area that has about 2 million refugees and hostages,"" he said. ""The [Israeli military] is fighting with his hand tied behind its back. It's very clear that we need to find a ladder to climb down. ""Prominent figures in Israel's security establishment are also searching for ways to redefine victory. The former spymaster of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, Yossi Cohen, told Israeli Army Radio that a victory over Hamas would be killing or capturing the group's leaders. A senior Hamas leader in Lebanon was killed in a blast this month attributed to Israel, but Israel's most wanted man, Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' top leader in Gaza, is still at large. A former head of Palestinian affairs in Israeli military intelligence, Michael Milshtein, says Israel's campaign in Gaza can achieve ""prominent results"" if it deters regional enemies. That would include Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed militia next door to Israel in Lebanon, as well as other militant groups around the Middle East, he says. ""If, for example, the final results of this war will be occupation of Gaza — huge, broad destruction of this place, killing thousands of Hamas members, and, of course, killing the head of the snake — it will have a very dramatic impact on enemies like Hezbollah, like the Iranians, like Syria, that, no, you cannot promote such brutal, violent moves against Israel without any payment. ""Week by week, Israel announces more Hamas tunnels destroyed and more Hamas fighters killed. But as a high number of Israeli soldiers killed and wounded continues to rise, according to a daily Israeli military tally, Hamas is still putting up a fight, and the country faces increasing international pressure to wind down its offensive. As the United States has called for, Israel is slowly transitioning to lower-intensity fighting in northern Gaza, withdrawing thousands of reservists. But fighting is escalating with Lebanese militants on Israel's northern border. ""I'll be surprised if Israel can maintain this intensity for many more months ahead,"" said Hulata, the former Israeli national security adviser. In an op-ed Tuesday, leading Israeli columnist Nahum Barnea called on Israel to adjust its objective of dismantling Hamas in Gaza. ""In the last three weeks the war has not changed reality. It has cost the lives of soldiers, has increased the risk of a humanitarian disaster that Israel will be responsible for, has hurt Israel in the world and hasn't brought us any closer to a victory which does not exist,"" Barnea wrote in Yediot Ahronot newspaper. On the other end of the political spectrum, voices on Israel's right say the country's leaders aren't willing to hammer Gaza hard enough. ""There will only be 50% victory in Gaza,"" says Tal Usach, 19, waiting for a bus outside Israeli military headquarters. He thinks complete victory would require Israel to permanently rule Gaza and ensure the territory's entire Palestinian population is relocated to neighboring countries. Several right-wing and far-right ministers in Netanyahu's government have called for the resettlement of Palestinians outside Gaza, a position that has drawn strong international rebuke and that is opposed by the U. S. , Israel's closest ally. ""Palestinian civilians must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow. They must not be pressed to leave Gaza,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday in a news conference after meeting Israeli leaders in Tel Aviv. ""The prime minister reaffirmed to me today that this is not the policy of Israel's government. ""Still, Netanyahu faces criticism from politicians in his own governing coalition who accuse Israel's military of being too soft on the Palestinians. Domestic politics may play a role in how Netanyahu wages the war in Gaza. Israel's military has appointed a team to investigate the security failures that resulted in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, and Netanyahu is expected to face questions about his own responsibility. Netanyahu's corruption trial will convene at a quicker pace beginning this month, and polls show his government has lost between a third and a fourth of its public support during the war. ""If it was up to Netanyahu, this would continue for quite some time,"" says Reuven Hazan, who teaches politics at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. ""For Netanyahu to end the war in Gaza, even with a victory, means he has to start dealing with the political issues at home and the legal issues, which he does not want to. ""Israel's Supreme Court this month struck down Netanyahu's government's signature legislation that tried to curtail the court's own powers, a judicial overhaul that had fueled massive protests in the months leading up to the war. The court has also pushed back on the government's attempts to make it harder to remove Netanyahu from office amid his ongoing corruption trial. ""If the war drags on, and Netanyahu's onslaught on the judicial branch returns, then you will see Israelis back in the streets, but this time, it won't be half the population,"" Hazan says. ""It'll be significantly more than half the population, and the government cannot survive that for too long.

103,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/11/1224126552/court-hearings-genocide-charges-israel,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands — In a case that strikes at the heart of Israel's national identity, South Africa formally accused the country of committing genocide against Palestinians and pleaded Thursday with the United Nations' top court to order an immediate halt to Israeli military operations in Gaza. Israel, which was founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust, has vehemently denied the allegations. As a sign of how seriously they regard the case, Israeli leaders have taken the rare step of engaging with the court to defend their international reputation. Israel often boycotts international tribunals or U. N. investigations, saying they are unfair and biased. During opening arguments at the International Court of Justice, South African lawyers said the latest Gaza war is part of decades of Israeli oppression of Palestinians. The court ""has the benefit of the past 13 weeks of evidence that shows incontrovertibly a pattern of conduct and related intention"" that amounts to ""a plausible claim of genocidal acts,"" South African lawyer Adila Hassim told the judges and audience in a packed room of the Peace Palace in The Hague. The two-day hearing is the public side of one of the most significant cases ever heard in an international court. The dispute goes to the core of one of the world's most intractable conflicts. South Africa is seeking preliminary orders to compel Israel to stop its military campaign in Gaza, where more than 23,000 people have died, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas. ""Nothing will stop the suffering except an order from this court,"" she said. Israel has focused attention on the Oct. 7 attacks, when Hamas fighters stormed through several communities and killed some 1,200 people, mainly civilians. They abducted around 250 others, nearly half of whom have been released. Although the court's findings are considered binding, it was unclear whether Israel would heed any order to halt the fighting. If it doesn't, it could face U. N. sanctions, although those may be blocked by a U. S. veto. Israel says it is battling a fierce enemy that carried out the deadliest attack on its territory since its creation in 1948. Israeli leaders insist they are following international law and doing their utmost to avoid harm to civilians. The country blames Hamas for the high death toll, saying its enemy operates in residential areas. In a post on X after the hearing, Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Lior Haiat called South Africa's presentation ""one of the greatest shows of hypocrisy"" and referred to the legal team as ""Hamas' representatives in court. "" He said South African lawyers distorted the reality in Gaza through a series of ""baseless and false claims. "" He did not elaborate. That reaction came after South Africa insisted Israel committed genocide by design. ""The scale of destruction in Gaza, the targeting of family homes and civilians, the war being a war on children, all make clear that genocidal intent is both understood and has been put into practice. The articulated intent is the destruction of Palestinian life,"" said lawyer Tembeka Ngcukaitobi. He said the case's ""distinctive feature"" was ""the reiteration and repetition of genocidal speech throughout every sphere of the state in Israel. ""Ahead of the proceedings, hundreds of pro-Israeli protesters marched close to the courthouse with banners saying ""Bring them home,"" referring to the hostages still being held by Hamas. One of the Israeli protesters was Michael Nevy, 42, whose brother was kidnapped by Hamas. ""People are talking about what Israel is doing, but Hamas is committing crime against humanity every day,"" he said. At a separate demonstration nearby, pro-Palestinians protesters waved flags calling for an end to ""Israeli apartheid"" and the adoption of a cease-fire. Chanting by protesters on the streets around the court's manicured grounds could sometimes be heard in the courtroom. The case targets the center of Israeli identity and the country's creation as a Jewish state in the aftermath of the Nazi Holocaust, which killed 6 million Jews. It also evokes issues central to South Africa's own identity: Its governing party, the African National Congress, has long compared Israel's policies in Gaza and the West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Blacks to ""homelands"" before ending in 1994. Israel, which has sent a strong legal team to make its defense, will address the court Friday. A decision on South Africa's request for so-called ""provisional measures"" will probably take weeks. The case is likely to last years. South Africa sought to broaden the case beyond the Israel-Hamas war. ""The violence and the destruction in Palestine and Israel did not begin on Oct. 7, 2023. The Palestinians have experienced systematic oppression and violence for the last 76 years,"" said South African Justice Minister Ronald Lamola. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a video statement Wednesday night defending his country's actions and insisting they have nothing to do with genocide. ""Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population,"" he said. ""Israel is fighting Hamas terrorists, not the Palestinian population, and we are doing so in full compliance with international law. ""About two-thirds of the dead in Gaza are women and children, health officials in Hamas-ruled Gaza say. The death toll does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. ""Mothers, fathers, children, siblings, grandparents, aunts, cousins are often all killed together. This killing is nothing short of destruction of Palestinian life. It is inflicted deliberately. No one is spared. Not even newborn babies,"" said South African lawyer Hassim. Finding food, water, medicine and working bathrooms has become a daily struggle for Palestinians in Gaza. Last week, the U. N. humanitarian chief called Gaza ""uninhabitable"" and said Palestinians were ""facing the highest levels of food insecurity ever recorded. "" Famine is ""around the corner. ""The world court, which rules on disputes between nations, has never judged a country to be responsible for genocide. The closest it came was in 2007 when it ruled that Serbia ""violated the obligation to prevent genocide"" in the July 1995 massacre by Bosnian Serb forces of more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the Bosnian enclave of Srebrenica. The nearby International Criminal Court prosecutes individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The case against Israel revolves around the genocide convention that was drawn up in 1948 following World War II. Both Israel and South Africa were signatories. Israel will be back on the International Court of Justice's docket next month, when hearings open into a U. N. request for an advisory opinion on the legality of Israeli policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.",npr_articles/article_103.txt,npr_results/article_103.txt.json
104,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/10/1223892458/israel-north-hezbollah-kiryat-shmona,"KIRYAT SHMONA, Israel — The strike hit mid-morning, right in the center of town. As a soldier swept the area for shrapnel, abnormal life continued like normal earlier this week. In Kiryat Shmona, the largest city in this far northern tip of Israel, less than two miles from Lebanon's border, people are used to this kind of thing. It was an anti-tank missile launched from Lebanon, a soldier at the scene said — aimed, perhaps, at the communications towers lining the steep hill that separates Kiryat Shmona from the Lebanese border. Instead, the missile soared over the hill and down into the city below, striking the largest intersection along the main highway, causing little damage and even less disruption. Within 30 minutes, the caution tape was taken down, and the scene had emptied. ""We deal with different cases of this type every day,"" said police captain Fadi Halabi. Most of this city's 22,000 residents have long since evacuated, fleeing after the Oct. 7 attack by the militant group Hamas on southern Israel that touched off the current war. For the few that remain, attacks like Monday's have become routine — especially over the past week, as rocket fire and aerial attacks from both sides of the border have ramped up after a strike in Lebanon's capital of Beirut killed a top Hamas official. ""It's not normal life for you, maybe, or for other people in the world, but it's my life,"" said Igor Potapov, 34, the employee of a shipping store who spoke calmly as blasts rang out from Israeli artillery firing at targets in Lebanon. ""I don't want it. I didn't choose it. But I won't leave from it,"" he said. Though Israel has not claimed credit for the Beirut strike, the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah has launched a retaliation, sending drone attacks and scores of rockets across the border. An initial barrage Saturday damaged an Israeli military base at Mount Meron; a second on Tuesday caused damage at the headquarters of Israel's Northern Command in Safed. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, said the Iran-backed group will respond ""on the battlefield,"" a battlefield that residents of northern Israel fear could include their hometowns. In turn, Israeli officials have increasingly vowed to keep the border region safe for its residents, even if that means a war. ""If Lebanon continues to serve as an active Iranian outpost, we will operate in southern Lebanon as in northern Gaza,"" Benny Gantz, a minister in Israel's emergency wartime cabinet, said Wednesday. This week, Israel has stepped up its strikes on Hezbollah, using fighter jets, drones, helicopters and artillery to hit what it says are targets on militants and combat infrastructure in southern Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah agree that Israeli strikes over the past week have killed a dozen or more Hezbollah militants. In total, more than 20 civilians have been killed in southern Lebanon since Oct. 7, according to the U. N. , and the conflict has displaced tens of thousands of people from their homes. Now, across the border in Kiryat Shmona, there are as many Israeli soldiers in town as there are civilians. Parks are empty. Stores are closed. The city buses still run on schedule, empty of passengers. Neighborhood streets are coated with a dusting of fruit and leaves that have fallen from trees and laid on the road, undisturbed by cars. And at all hours is the constant soundtrack of conflict: military aircraft, artillery blasts and air raid alarms. ""I'm here with butterflies in my stomach,"" said Tzipi Kuzibardov, an evacuee who made a brief trip to town to visit the bank, doing so ""with lots and lots of fear, and quickly. ""Her grandchildren cry when they hear the loud booms of the Israeli artillery, she said. But the small community where her family has evacuated is located near an air base, she said, and Hezbollah's recent strikes on Israel military bases makes them feel unsafe there, too. ""It's the people, the citizens, who end up suffering from this whole story of the war,"" she said. Hezbollah ""don't want peace,"" she added. ""They just want to expel us. ""Most residents here left soon after Oct. 7, fearing that Hezbollah fighters would storm across the Lebanon border in an attack similar to the one Hamas inflicted on southern Israel that day. Soon after the war began, the Israeli government began to pay for hotels for evacuees from border towns to stay in regions further from conflict. The high number of evacuations since Oct. 7 has helped keep casualty counts low in Kiryat Shmona; a strike in October injured two people, and two more were hurt in November. Across northern Israel, four civilians and nine soldiers have been killed since Oct. 7, according to media reports citing Israeli officials. What once felt to residents like a temporary, short-term displacement has dragged into its fourth month, and the long-simmering conflict with Hezbollah seems to only be worsening. Before Oct. 7, Sisilya al-Ousi, 50, lived in an apartment on the top floor of a tall building. But in the early weeks of the war, she fell twice as she ran down the stairs to the building's basement bomb shelter. Because Kiryat Shmona is so close to southern Lebanon, alarms here give residents only a few seconds of notice to seek shelter ahead of an incoming rocket. ""Once I hurt my back, and once I broke my teeth. I'm traumatized by being on the top floor,"" she said. Now, she has made a second home in the bunker, complete with bunk beds made up with fleece blankets, a mini fridge and a folding table stocked with fresh fruit, bottled water and instant ramen. ""I'm here all the time. I don't want to go back up,"" she said. Ousi has found purpose in staying behind, she said. She feeds the pets that have been left behind by neighbors who evacuated, and she brings food to soldiers stationed nearby. ""If they let me, I would go to the border too. Let me defend my country,"" she said. Her sentiment is shared by few of her neighbors. One of them, Oz Vaknin, 22, had returned briefly to pick up a few things from his apartment, he said. He has evacuated to a suburb of Tel Aviv. Asked what it would take to feel safe living in Kiryat Shmona, he replied, ""If the war with Nasrallah and Hezbollah is over, then maybe. "" But such a war has barely even begun, he said. His lease is up in two months, Vaknin said. Afterward, he plans to move away.

105,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/10/1223906769/yemens-houthis-red-sea-attack-missiles-drones-us-navy-un-resolution,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen's Houthi rebels fired their largest-ever barrage of drones and missiles targeting shipping in the Red Sea, forcing the United States and British navies to shoot down the projectiles in a major naval engagement, authorities said Wednesday. No damage was immediately reported. The attack by the Iranian-backed Houthis came despite a planned United Nations Security Council vote later Wednesday to potentially condemn and demand an immediate halt to the attacks by the rebels, who say their assaults are aimed at stopping Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. However, their targets increasingly have little — or no — connection to Israel and imperil a crucial trade route linking Asia and the Middle East with Europe. That raises the risk of a U. S. retaliatory strike on Yemen that could upend an uneasy cease-fire that has held in the Arab world's poorest country. The assault happened off the Yemeni port cities of Hodeida and Mokha, according to the private intelligence firm Ambrey. In the Hodeida attack, Ambrey said ships described over radio seeing missiles and drones, with U. S. -allied warships in the area urging ""vessels to proceed at maximum speed. ""Off Mokha, ships saw missiles fired, a drone in the air and small vessels trailing them, Ambrey said early Wednesday. The British military's United Kingdom Marine Trade Operations also acknowledged the attack off Hodeida. The U. S. military's Central Command said the ""complex attack"" launched by the Houthis included bomb-carrying drones, anti-ship cruise missiles and one anti-ship ballistic missile. It said 18 drones, two cruise missiles and the anti-ship missile were downed by F-18s from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, as well as by American Arleigh Burke-class destroyers the USS Gravely, the USS Laboon and the USS Mason, as well as the United Kingdom's HMS Diamond. ""This is the 26th Houthi attack on commercial shipping lanes in the Red Sea since Nov. 19,"" Central Command said. ""There were no injuries or damage reported. """"Vessels are advised to transit with caution and report any suspicious activity,"" the UKTMO added. British Defense Secretary Grant Shapps described the assault as ""the largest attack by the Iranian-backed Houthis in the Red Sea to date,"" saying the Diamond used Sea Viper missiles and guns to shoot down multiple drones. ""The U. K. alongside allies have previously made clear that these illegal attacks are completely unacceptable and if continued the Houthis will bear the consequences,"" Shapps said in a statement. ""We will take the action needed to protect innocent lives and the global economy. ""Responding to U. S. sinking of Houthi shipsThe Houthis, a Shiite group that has held Yemen's capital of Sanaa since 2014, later claimed responsibility for the attack in a televised statement by rebel spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree. Saree claimed the attack ""targeted an American ship that was providing support to the Zionist entity,"" without offering any further information. He also described it as an ""initial response"" to American troops sinking Houthi vessels and killing 10 rebel fighters last week. The Houthis will ""continue to prevent Israeli ships or those heading to the ports of occupied Palestine from navigating in the Red Sea until the aggression stops and the siege on our steadfast brothers in the Gaza Strip ends,"" Saree said. The Houthis say their attacks aim to end the pounding Israeli air-and-ground offensive targeting the Gaza Strip amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. However, the links to the ships targeted in the rebel assaults have grown more tenuous as the attacks continue. The Red Sea links the Mideast and Asia to Europe via the Suez Canal, and its narrow Bab el-Mandeb Strait. The strait is only 18 miles wide at its narrowest point, limiting traffic to two channels for inbound and outbound shipments, according to the U. S. Energy Information Administration. Nearly 10% of all oil traded at sea passes through it and an estimated $1 trillion in goods pass through the strait annually. The U. S. waters down its U. N. resolutionA U. S. draft resolution before the U. N. Security Council, obtained late Tuesday by The Associated Press, says the Houthi attacks impede global commerce ""and undermine navigational rights and freedoms as well as regional peace and security. "" The resolution would demand the immediate release of the first ship the Houthis attacked, the Galaxy Leader, a Japanese-operated cargo ship with links to an Israeli company that the rebels seized in November along with its crew. An initial draft of the resolution would have recognized ""the right of member states, in accordance with international law, to take appropriate measures to defend their merchant and naval vessels. ""The final draft is weaker, eliminating any U. N. recognition of a country's right to defend its ships. Instead, it would affirm that the navigational rights and freedoms of merchant and commercial vessels must be respected, and take note ""of the right of member states, in accordance with international law, to defend their vessels from attacks, including those that undermine navigational rights and freedoms. ""A U. S-led coalition of nations has been patrolling the Red Sea to try and prevent the attacks. There's been no broad retaliatory strike yet, despite warnings from the U. S. However, Tuesday's attack appeared to be testing what response, if any, would come from Washington. Meanwhile, a separate, tentative cease-fire between the Houthis and a Saudi-led coalition fighting on behalf of Yemen's exiled government has held for months, despite the long civil war in Yemen. This has raised concerns that any wider conflict in the sea — or a potential reprisal strike from Western forces — could reignite those tensions in Yemen. It also may draw in Iran, which has so far largely avoided directly entering the wider Israel-Hamas war, further into the conflict.",npr_articles/article_105.txt,npr_results/article_105.txt.json

The fighting sent Palestinians scrambling to find safety and hampered aid groups' efforts to get relief to the population. Blinken said he had promises from four Arab nations and Turkey to help rebuild Gaza after the war. But those nations also want to see an end to the fighting in Gaza and concrete steps toward the eventual creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, something Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed not to allow. The U. S. and Israel also remain deeply divided over how Gaza will be run when — and if — its current Hamas rulers are defeated. American officials have called for the Palestinian Authority, which currently governs parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, to take the reins in Gaza. Israeli leaders have rejected that idea but have not put forward a concrete plan beyond saying they will maintain open-ended military control over the territory. At the same time, Blinken is trying to prevent an all-out war between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah. After an Israeli strike last week hit Beirut, killing Hamas's deputy leader, the two sides have stepped up their exchanges. ""There is lots to talk about, in particular about the way forward,"" Blinken said after meeting Israeli President Isaac Herzog. On Tuesday, Hezbollah said its exploding drones targeted the Israeli army northern command in the town of Safed — deeper into Israel than previous fire by the group. The Israeli military said a drone fell at a base in the north without causing damage, suggesting it had been intercepted. Military officials did not identify the base. The United States has pressed Israel to scale down its offensive in Gaza to more precise operations targeting Hamas. But the pace of death and destruction has remained largely the same, with several hundred Palestinians killed each day, according to health officials in Gaza. Israel has vowed to keep going until it destroys Hamas throughout the territory, in response to the attack on Oct. 7, when militants killed some 1,200 people, mainly civilians, in southern Israel and kidnapped around 250 others. Still, after three months of fighting, Hamas continues to put up a fierce fight. The Israeli military says it has dismantled Hamas infrastructure in northern Gaza, where large swaths of the cityscape have been demolished. But fighting continues there against what Israel says are pockets of militants. The offensive's focus has shifted to the southern city of Khan Younis and a number of urban refugee camps in central Gaza. ""The fighting will continue throughout 2024,"" military spokesman Daniel Hagari said. Since the war began, Israel's assault in Gaza has killed more than 23,200 Palestinians, roughly 1% of the territory's population, and more than 58,000 people have been wounded, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. About two-thirds of the dead are women and children. The death toll does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Throughout the night and into Tuesday morning, warplanes struck multiple areas in and around Khan Younis and in central Gaza, where 57 dead and dozens of wounded were brought into the main hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah. One strike late Monday hit a house in Deir al-Balah, killing the mother, three daughters and three small grandchildren of Jamal Naeim, a well-known dentist in Gaza. Outside the hospital, Naeim cradled a small bundle of white cloth the size of an infant containing all that was left of one of his adult daughters, Shaimaa, who was also a dentist. ""This is Dr. Shaimaa, 27 years old. This is what we found of her, just the skin of her head and her hair,"" he said, breaking into sobs. Naeim is the brother of Bassem Naeim, a political figure in Hamas, but is not a member of the group himself, residents said. Israeli troops have been pushing into several urban refugee camps near Deir al-Balah, fighting with militants and pounding the densely built districts with heavy airstrikes and shelling. The camps were built to house Palestinians driven out of homes during the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. Over time, the camps grew into towns. Monday was one of the deadliest days yet for Israeli troops in Gaza, with nine killed, according to the military. Six of them died in a blast that went off when forces were bringing explosives into an underground area in Bureij camp, apparently to blow up Hamas tunnels, Israeli media reported. The military declined to comment. It says 185 soldiers have been killed since the ground offensive began in late October. Nearly 85% of Gaza's population of 2. 3 million have been driven from their homes by the fighting, and a quarter of its residents face starvation, with only a trickle of food, water, medicine and other supplies entering through an Israeli siege. The U. N. humanitarian office, known as OCHA, warned that the fighting was severely hampering aid deliveries. Several warehouses, distribution centers, health facilities and shelters have been affected by the military's evacuation orders, it said. Some bakeries in the central city of Deir al-Balah have been forced to shut down. A U. N. warehouse was hit last week, killing a staffer, and five other staffers were detained by the military, with two still held. The situation is even more dire in northern Gaza, which Israeli forces cut off from the rest of the territory in late October. Tens of thousands of people who remain there face shortages of food and water. The World Health Organization has been unable to deliver supplies to the north for two weeks. OCHA said the military rejected five planned aid convoys to the north over that period, including deliveries of medical supplies and fuel for water and sanitation facilities. As Blinken arrived in Israel, exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah continued their spiral since last week's killing of Hamas deputy leader Saleh Arouri in Beirut. Hezbollah said its drone strike on the base in northern Israel on Tuesday was further retaliation for the killing of Arouri and of a senior Hezbollah commander in an Israeli bombing Monday. On Tuesday morning, an Israeli drone hit a car in southern Lebanon, killing three people inside, security officials in the area and the state news agency said. There was no immediate word on the identities of the three. Israel has repeatedly warned that time is running out before it launches a campaign to end militants' fire across the border. U. S. officials have said they expect Blinken's discussions with Netanyahu, the War Cabinet and other officials to be some of the most difficult on his current Mideast tour, his fourth since the war began. Blinken said Monday that Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey agreed to begin planning for the reconstruction and governance of Gaza once Israel's war against Hamas ends. Those countries previously resisted U. S. calls for post-war planning to begin, insisting that there must first be a cease-fire and a sharp reduction in the civilian suffering in Gaza.",npr_articles/article_106.txt,npr_results/article_106.txt.json
107,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/08/1222718339/why-watermelons-are-symbol-of-palestinian-solidarity,"Since the war between Israel and Hamas began, the United States and world leaders at the United Nations have been debating the specific language to use for a resolution that would call for a suspension of hostilities in Gaza. After 93 days of war, Palestinian health officials say more than 23,000 people in Gaza have been killed in Israel's bombardments and ground operations in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks, which killed 1,200 people and seized 240 hostages. In response to the ongoing war and the different debates around it, people are using watermelon images to communicate solidarity with the Palestinians — because the fruit's colors match the Palestinian flag. But some activists are doing it as a workaround to tackle documented reports of online censorship and shadow banning, where platforms restrict creators' content without their knowledge. A 51-page study published by Human Rights Watch (HRW) details how Instagram's moderation policies have ""censored or otherwise unduly suppressed"" over 1,000 counts of ""peaceful content. "" Deborah Brown, a senior researcher on digital rights at HRW, talked to NPR about the impact of what they found and online censorship. Brown detailed that ""if people are using social media to raise awareness about what's happening in Gaza, and are being censored, this will have an impact on the collective response. "" Meta's spokesperson, Ben Walters, denied claims of bias in censoring content from Palestinians and their supporters in a statement. ""This report ignores the realities of enforcing our policies globally during a fast-moving, highly polarized and intense conflict, which has led to an increase in content being reported to us,"" the statement read.  People worldwide are using watermelon images to support a cease-fire in Gaza, despite differing statements and debates. Watermelons are appearing in protests, on walls, and in online posts, symbolizing solidarity amid the increasing civilian casualties and destruction. Following the Arab-Israeli war in 1967, public displays of the Palestinian flag were outlawed in Israel. Anyone who displayed the flag or its colors could face arrest. The ban was lifted in the 1993 Oslo Accords, but Israel's new far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir ordered the removal of Palestinian flags flying in public spaces last year. While the exact history of watermelon symbolism in Palestinian history is not locally and universally agreed upon, renowned Palestinian artist Sliman Mansour says the idea of the watermelon's connection with the Palestinian flag came from an Israeli soldier who was trying to censor his gallery in the 1980s. Mansour told Morning Edition the story of when Israeli officials came to his studio and confiscated some works that depicted the struggle of the Palestinian people. ""They recommended that we do the beautiful flowers and beautiful nude figures, and he said that he would buy it from us,"" Mansour said. He added that the Israeli officer then gave the gallery two orders: ""We are not allowed to make an exhibition unless we get the permission from them to exhibit the works, and we are not allowed to paint in red, green, black and white. These are the colors of the Palestinian flag. ""Isam Bader, another artist in the Palestinian gallery, asked the Israeli official what would happen if he drew a flower with those colors? Mansour described the mood changing in the room. ""Then the interrogator said they will confiscate it. Even if you paint a watermelon, we will confiscate it,"" he recalled. Mansour explained the banning only inspired further resistance.  ""This created the kind of sensation among artists, you know, like forbidding artists to paint in certain colors,"" he said. ""So we had a lot of support from many artists from around the world and also from Israeli artists. ""Mansour's art was initially intended to represent Palestinian culture and be devoid of politics. He painted landscapes of olive groves and scenes of Palestinian people working in the fields. ""This made the Israelis very angry. I don't know why,"" Mansour said. A year after the incident with the Israeli official in his gallery, Mansour tells NPR he was randomly detained and questioned by Israeli officials. He says the experience of witnessing the occupation firsthand changed his art forever: ""I learned a lot, you know, from going through the interrogation and having a bag on my head and my hands handcuffed behind me and standing like 24 hours without food, without drink, without anything,"" he said. Mansour started to draw watermelons and other political art after that. Artists and activists drew inspiration from Mansour's story and started using the watermelon as a symbol of identity and resistance. Palestinians and their supporters would carry watermelon slices as a sign of protest. Tamara Taha, a Palestinian American activist in Washington, D. C. , shared with NPR that beyond representing the flag's colors, the watermelon has long symbolized Palestinian resistance to occupation. In the ongoing deadly war, its significance has deepened due to what she describes as both social media censorship and self-censorship. ""When facing censorship on social media platforms and self-censorship simultaneously, Palestinian communities in the diaspora turn everyday injustices into their canvas,"" Taha explained. ""The watermelon is our modest act of defiance. ""Police still crack down on displays of Palestinian flags in Israel and the occupied territories, but Mansour says Palestinian symbols will endure. ""As long as the occupation goes on, it will stay on. I mean, as a symbol,"" he said. Ana Perez produced the audio version of this story.",npr_articles/article_107.txt,npr_results/article_107.txt.json
108,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/08/1223446855/israel-hezbollah-commander-killed-lebanon-gaza-hamas,"BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike killed an elite Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon on Monday, the latest in an escalating exchange of strikes along the border that have raised fears of another Mideast war even as the fighting in Gaza exacts a mounting toll on civilians. The strike on an SUV killed a commander in a secretive Hezbollah force that operates along the border, according to a Lebanese security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity according to regulations. Hezbollah identified the slain fighter as Wissam al-Tawil without providing details. He is the most senior militant in the armed group to have been killed since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel triggered all-out war in Gaza and lower-intensity fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which has escalated since an Israeli strike killed a senior Hamas leader in Beirut last week. U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is back in the region this week, appears to be trying to head off a wider conflict. Israel says it has largely wrapped up major operations in northern Gaza and is now focusing on the central region and the southern city of Khan Younis. Israeli officials have said the fighting will continue for many more months as the army seeks to dismantle Hamas and return scores of hostages taken during the militant group's Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war. The offensive has already killed over 23,000 Palestinians, devastated vast swaths of the Gaza Strip, displaced nearly 85% of its population of 2. 3 million and left a quarter of its residents facing starvation. Medics, patients and displaced people fled from the main hospital in central Gaza as the fighting drew closer, witnesses said Monday. Losing the facility would be another major blow to a health system shattered by three months of war. Doctors Without Borders and other aid groups withdrew from Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah in recent days, saying it was too dangerous. That spread panic among people sheltering there, causing many to join the hundreds of thousands who have fled to the south of the besieged territory. Tens of thousands of people have sought shelter in Gaza's hospitals, which are also struggling to treat dozens of people wounded each day in Israeli strikes. Only 13 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are even partially functioning, according to the U. N. humanitarian office. Omar al-Darawi, an employee at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, said the facility has been struck multiple times in recent days. He said thousands of people left after the aid groups pulled out, and that patients have been concentrated on one floor so the remaining doctors can tend to them more easily. ""We have large numbers of wounded who can't move"" he said. ""They need special care, which is unavailable. ""More dead and wounded arrive each day as Israeli forces advance in central Gaza following heavy airstrikes. Gaza's Health Ministry said Monday that 249 Palestinians have been killed and 510 others were wounded across the territory in the last 24 hours. World Health Organization staff who visited Sunday saw ""sickening scenes of people of all ages being treated on blood-streaked floors and in chaotic corridors,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the U. N. agency, said in a statement. ""The bloodbath in Gaza must end. ""The situation is even more dire in northern Gaza, which Israeli forces cut off from the rest of the territory in late October. Entire neighborhoods have been demolished, and hundreds of thousands of people have fled, while those who remain face severe shortages of food and water. The WHO said late Sunday it has not been able to deliver supplies to northern Gaza in 12 days. Even there, Israel is still battling what it describes as pockets of militants. An airstrike early Sunday flattened a four-story home filled with displaced people in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, killing at least 70, including women and children, according to Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza's civil defense. There was no immediate confirmation from the Health Ministry, which has struggled to maintain its operations in the north. Search efforts were still underway on Monday. The civil defense circulated a graphic video showing the aftermath of attack, with several bodies scattered among the rubble. Jabaliya, which was built for Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation and is now a dense, built-up neighborhood, has seen weeks of heavy fighting. More than 23,00 Palestinians have been killed, and more than 58,000 wounded, since the war began, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. The death toll does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Health officials say about two-thirds of those killed have been women and minors. Israel blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the group operates in heavily populated residential areas, but the military rarely comments on individual strikes. The military says it has killed some 8,000 militants, without providing evidence, and that 176 of its own soldiers have been killed in the offensive. Blinken, who met with the leaders of Jordan and Qatar on Sunday, once again spoke of the need for Israel to adjust its military operations to minimize harm to civilians and allow more aid into the territory. But his main focus appeared to be preventing the war from spreading. A Hezbollah rocket barrage hit a sensitive air traffic base in northern Israel on Saturday in one of the biggest attacks in three months of low-intensity fighting along the border. The militant group said was an ""initial response"" to the killing of Hamas' deputy political leader Saleh Arouri in Beirut last week. Israel has mostly sought to limit the fighting in its north, but its leaders say their patience is wearing thin, and that if the tensions cannot be resolved through diplomacy, they are prepared to go to war. They have expressed particular concern about the Radwan Force, the elite Hezbollah unit in which al-Tawil was a commander, which operates along the border. Hezbollah began firing rockets shortly after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack ignited the war. Hamas and other militants killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel that day, mostly civilians, and took some 250 people hostage, over 100 of whom were released during a cease-fire in November. Hezbollah has said its attacks, which have driven tens of thousands of Israelis from their homes, aim to ease pressure on Gaza. But the group appears wary of risking an all-out war that would bring massive destruction to Lebanon.",npr_articles/article_108.txt,npr_results/article_108.txt.json
109,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/07/1222578695/gaza-october-7-art-israel-palestinians,"In Israel's cultural capital of Tel Aviv, a vibrant artistic community leaves its colorful mark with murals and other art painted throughout the narrow streets of the city's ancient Jaffa neighborhood and on the walls of businesses within the financial-centered downtown. Within this same space is a Palestinian community that has long turned to art as a form of resistance, using it to bring light to the struggles of Palestinians in Tel Aviv, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. Since Oct. 7, much of this work has turned heartbroken, mournful, angry and fearful, as members of these artistic communities confront heavy, unimaginable emotions that are bleeding into their craft. More than 1,200 people in Israel were killed on that day and hundreds of others were kidnapped by Hamas. In response, Israel launched a now months-old war in Gaza that has killed more than 22,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly two million others. Artists are processing the crisis in a myriad of ways: through paintings of the horrors of war, through anguished song and in dance. The work has been shared in places like Tel Aviv's Hostages Square, where protesters regularly gather to demand the release of Israeli captives being held by Hamas, and on social media, where a Palestinian diaspora say they can more safely post their work than those still living under the Israeli government. ""I think that if art can function as something, not only for the viewer, but for myself, it's to create a space for reflection and reassessing and trying to dissect and process and understand,"" said Addam Yekutieli, an Israeli artist based in Tel Aviv. NPR spoke to Yekutieli and five other Israeli and Palestinian artists on how the war between Israel and Hamas has affected their lives and their work. Each artist took time to reflect on Oct. 7 and its aftermath, sharing stories of fear, anger, sadness and pain. ""In times of stress, usually people go for black, people go for dark colors,"" said Rana Samara, a Palestinian artist from Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. ""I found that now, my stress has come out with very, very, very bright colors. "" Samara's work frequently uses bright paint  to explore topics like sexuality, gender roles and other issues tied to Palestinian life. When war broke out in Gaza, she decided to turn to the images she was seeing on TV and social media and weave it into her work. Samara is part of a group of Palestinian artists that joined with the Zawyeh Gallery in Ramallah to create work to help raise money for humanitarian aid in Gaza. ""What caught my mind and heart in what I was watching about this war was the issue of children. And so I looked and I concentrated on what each child was carrying"" as they evacuated their homes in Gaza, she said. For one piece, Samara decided to create a type of poster of these different scenes of children fleeing their homes using bright reds and pinks. Using the image of the children's piggy bank, for example, she incorporated the war. ""My idea was a piggy bank and inside a tank,"" she said. At first look, it's an attractive, colorful, bright picture, ""but when you get close to it, it's the bleak image. It's the tank. ""Before Oct. 7, many of Michal Worke's paintings had rich purples and vibrant patterns that reflected her travels in Ethiopia and South Africa. But now, the colors in her latest works are muted with blues and grays. ""It started with the shock of the kidnappings, and the murders and disasters,"" she said of the attack by Hamas militants. Worke, who is a Jewish Israeli of Ethiopian descent, found that the footage on social media and on the news of the attack wove itself into her psyche. ""I think I responded like everyone to the trauma that we saw. It was really hard for me. I started having dreams that they are coming for me, and they start shooting and I didn't know where to hide or where to go,"" she said. In the early days after the attack, Worke said she was avoiding the studio and turning more inward to collect her thoughts and take stock of her emotions. Worke is a painter that has long advocated for the release of Avera Mengistu, a fellow Israeli of Ethiopian descent that has been in Hamas custody for nine years. She regularly paints Mengistu and his family, sharing her work online. Since Oct. 7, she's seen the abundance of artwork created in honor of the fallen and the more than 240 hostages taken by Hamas that day, of which more than 100 remain in captivity. ""But not for Avera. He isn't there, his face isn't anywhere,"" she said. So, in response she's worked to continue to amplify Mengistu's story so that he isn't forgotten. Worke has also begun painting other things about the war and the interconnectedness she is finding between the war and her Ethiopian community. ""Many Ethiopian soldiers have died,"" she said. ""Ninety percent of Ethiopians [in Israel] go to combat units. It's the highest percentage of any community. So many have died. ""She's incorporated the untold stories of Israeli soldiers of Ethiopian descent fighting in Gaza into works that also raise awareness for Mengistu. In one piece, a soldier dressed in his uniform is sitting comfortably by a fence splitting southern Israel with Gaza. On the margins, Worke includes the number of days Mengistu has been in custody. Along the ground of the painting are pieces of bloodstained uniforms. ""This is from a series of larger paintings I'm working on. And you can see the jump between this painting and the others. The difference in the colors and the themes,"" she said. ""These paintings were done only three months apart. "" Bashar Murad has long used pop music as a tool to express his experience as a Palestinian born within the ""oppression"" of the Israeli government, he said. ""I create pop music that kind of reflects my experience as a human born in this place and all the complexities that come with being born in this place,"" he says. ""I believe in the power of pop music to reach the masses to help share and spread messages of equality and love, which is what pop music is all about. "" Murad frequently used social media to share his music and thoughts. That all changed shortly after war broke out in Gaza.  He said the feelings of depression and shock that struck him in the hours and days that followed left him homebound and essentially bed-ridden. ""For the first 20 days, I didn't go out of my room, basically,"" he said. ""The sad thing is that for a lot of people in the world, this feels like it's the first time that these events are happening,"" Murad said. ""We have gone through a cycle of this ongoing violence. I've already written countless songs already throughout the years that actually talk about the same feeling that I'm feeling now. Maybe now it is times 1 million. But it's the same feeling. It's the same feeling of powerlessness and helplessness. ""This time there also emerged a new level of fear that Murad and other Palestinian artists hadn't quite felt before. After the war began, Palestinians in Israel reported discrimination, firings and other threats of violence for simple social media posts criticizing the war. That scared many Palestinians in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza into silence, Murad said. ""It's very dangerous for us artists, right now. There's major censorship that is happening,"" he said. ""There is a war on the ground, there's a war on social media, but there's also a mental war and a war on our identities. ""Murad said he is trying to ""be smarter with what I post"" — a sentiment that Samara, the painter in Ramallah, also shared. He said the fighting is not just a war with Gaza, ""It's a war on all Palestinians and all Palestinian identity. "" He called it a ""continuous struggle,"" adding, ""it's not something that starts with an attack and ends with a ceasefire. "" ""In how many ways can your heart break?""""Whose trauma speaks louder than whose?""""Can we ever be well?""These are questions Addam Yekutieli has had rolling around in his mind ever since Oct. 7. Yekutieli is a multidisciplinary artist based in Tel Aviv. In his ongoing projects, he has reflected on the ideas of scars and borders and the effect they have on people geographically, physically and psychologically. ""I've always dealt with kind of like political or social themes, but for a very long time, they were much more metaphorical than they are now,"" he said. Yekutieli, like Worke, found it difficult to return to his normal workload after Oct. 7. About a month after the attacks, Yekutieli spoke about how his work has changed since the outbreak of the war. ""I haven't really made any art since October 7,"" he said in November. ""I've been mainly writing since then. ""And what he's been writing is a long list of questions he has on his mind and has shared it on social media. He calls these posts ""questions with no answers. "" ""Over the past month and a half, I've had so many  internal conversations and dialogues and kind of been really like talking myself into circles,"" he said. He posts questions like ""What are your five stages of grief?"" and ""If you had it your way, what would happen?"" ""I think that I just feel more comfortable with asking questions more than making statements. They feel more honest. It feels more of an authentic place to be in. And, I think that it also allows more reflection,"" he said. He said the tragedy shook him on a foundational level. ""I think that there are parts of me that feels very naïve. But it feels like everything is spiraling out of control, and becoming progressively worse and worse,"" he said. Yekutieli acknowledged that as an Israeli artist he has a level of privilege to more comfortably share his thoughts and questions on a public domain like Instagram than his Palestinian artist peers who fear reprisal for doing so. He believes a lot of the hostility toward Palestinians, activists and Israelis critical of their government comes from a place of deep desperation and grief. ""I think that things are very, very emotional,"" he said. ""And at the same time, I really think that it's important, as much as we can, and as much as one feels comfortable with, to keep on being vocal. ""Dance has always been a source of healing for Hanna Tams, a professional dancer that specializes in contemporary and dabka styles. As a Palestinian living in Jerusalem, Tams has faced oppression his whole life, he said. After the war broke out, it became even more complex and tense than before, he said. ""I was lucky to find dance as a friend,"" he said. ""I can resist through dancing. Other people don't have this luxury. ""Tams is the founder of Douban Art Studio, which he opened in 2020 to serve his community's youth to work through their emotions and struggles in a safe way. But after Oct. 7, he retreated into himself and closed the studio for two weeks. ""I really wasn't able to do anything and I wasn't feeling up to dance. I was sick,"" he said. It was the community he's worked to serve that reached out to beg him to reopen and help the kids stuck at home. They told him, ""'It's the kids who are suffering. The kids have no school, they are at home and they are watching TV with us. They are afraid,'"" Tams said. He reopened the studio, but not without difficulty. The studio is in East Jerusalem, in an area where Israeli soldiers constantly patrol the streets and stop Palestinian residents. ""It's really frightening because every time I will be approached by a soldier who starts asking me why you're coming here and you're not allowed,"" he said. In November, Tams was able to perform in a timely show in Switzerland called ""Last Things Remaining. "" The show involved four dancers telling the story of Palestinians and the resilience it takes to live in this region. He returned saying, ""I need to serve this community. I need to serve these people who don't have anything. ""When asked how he could still turn to art and especially dance in such a hard time, he said,  ""For me, the only way I can really help and I can really kind of connect, it's [through] dancing. ""He continued, ""I think art is kind of the language of every culture, and it's the language of hearts. So if you want to [get at] every heart, I think art is needed. ""After the war started, Oren Fischer said he reached a point where he just couldn't deal with any more words. ""So I started painting,"" he said. In the first two weeks after the attacks, Fischer said he slept horribly and had nightmares based on what he was seeing on TV and social media. He decided to make a change: Instead of doom scrolling each morning, Fischer would instead wake up and meditate on his feelings and ""just try to puke it on the papers. "" Fischer, an artist who uses different mediums in his work like video, illustration and textiles, has been using paint and crayon in his sketchbook for these daily pieces. He describes his paintings as ""childish"" and ""naïve"" in a way even as it portrays horrors of the Oct. 7 attacks and the war. ""I thought, okay, if it's bothering me, it's probably something people really relate to. It's probably not just me thinking about this,"" he said. ""It helped me to heal myself. I made sort of a routine that I wake up and for a few hours I paint and upload on social media,"" he said. ""So I created my own world inside the catastrophe. ""Like much of his past work, this series of paintings has been deeply critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, blaming their policies as the spark that led to the attack. Fischer painted a sketch of Netanyahu with vibrant reds, yellows, oranges and blues of the prime minister with blood on his hands. In the background are Hamas attackers shooting people and homes burning. The image was later used on the cover of an Israeli newspaper. Fischer said his work has been criticized by some people who misunderstood his sketches as him attacking Palestinians, when the work is really turning criticism to the Israeli government. Ultimately, Fischer said the impact of the attacks and the ongoing war ""is everywhere.  You cannot hide from it. "" NPR's Jaclyn Diaz reported from Tel Aviv, Ramallah and Jerusalem.

110,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/07/1223347663/blinken-meets-jordans-king-on-mideast-mission-to-prevent-gaza-war-spreading,"DOHA, Qatar — On another urgent diplomatic mission to the Middle East, U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Sunday with Arab partners to press for their help in tamping down resurgent fears that Israel's three-month war against Hamas in Gaza could spread. In discussions with Qatar's emir and Jordan's king, Blinken spoke of the need for Israel to adjust its military operations to reduce civilian casualties and significantly boost the amount of humanitarian aid reaching Gaza, while stressing the importance of preparing detailed plans for the post-conflict future of the Palestinian territory, which has been decimated by Israeli bombardments. The mission — that will also take him to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Israel, the West Bank and Egypt before he returns to Washington — is Blinken's fourth to the region since the war began. After a day of talks with Turkish and Greek leaders in Istanbul and Crete, Blinken met with Jordan's King Abdullah II and Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi in Amman before traveling to Doha for talks with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani to seek buy-in for U. S. efforts to tamp down resurgent fears that the war could engulf the region, ramp up aid to Gaza and prepare for an eventual end of hostilities. ""This is a conflict that could easily metastasize, causing even more insecurity and even more suffering,"" Blinken told reporters during a joint news conference with Sheikh Mohammed. ""So from day one, among other priorities, we have been intensely focused on working to prevent the conflict from spreading. ""Blinken said it is has been a major focus of his discussion with all of the leaders he has met with in recent days. ""We share a commitment to ensure that the conflict does not expand,"" he said. He said they also have discussed what each country can do once the conflict is over ""to provide the assurances and the incentives required to build a more secure and more stable, more peaceful future for the region. """"And my takeaway from the discussion so far, including here with our friends in Qatar, is that our partners are willing to have these difficult conversations and to make hard decisions. All of us feel a stake in forging the way forward. ""Jordan and other Arab states have been highly critical of Israel's actions and have eschewed public support for long-term planning, arguing that the fighting must end before such discussions can begin. They have been demanding a cease-fire since mid-October as civilian casualties began to skyrocket. After his talks with Blinken, Sheikh Mohammed called for an immediate cease-fire, saying the constant images of death and destruction in Gaza are de-sensitizing people to the horrors of what is happening. ""This is a big test for our humanity,"" he said. ""We are looking for a sustainable future, however the focus is now on stopping the fighting. ""King Abdullah ""warned of the catastrophic repercussions"" of the war in Gaza while calling on the U. S. to press for an immediate cease-fire, a statement from the Royal Court said. Israel has refused to agree to a cease-fire and the U. S. has instead called for specified temporary ""humanitarian pauses"" to allow aid to get in and people to get to safety. In Amman, Blinken also toured the World Food Program's regional coordination warehouse, where trucks are being packed with aid to be delivered to Gaza through both the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings. He commended the work of the WFP and other U. N. agencies as well as the government of Jordan to get assistance into Gaza. ""The efforts right here to collect and distribute food to people in need are absolutely essential,"" Blinken said. ""The United States has worked from day one to open access routes into Gaza. """"We continue to work on that every single day, not only to open them but to multiply them, to maximize them and to try to get more assistance, more effectively,"" he said. ""We're determined to do everything we possibly can to ameliorate the situation for the men, women and children in Gaza. ""The U. S. has been pressing Israel for weeks to let greater amounts of food, water, fuel, medicine and other supplies into Gaza, and the U. N. Security Council passed a resolution on Dec. 22 calling for an immediate increase in deliveries. Three weeks ago, Israel opened Kerem Shalom, adding a second entry point for aid into Gaza after Rafah. Still, the rate of trucks entering has not risen significantly. This week, an average of around 120 trucks a day entered through Rafah and Kerem Shalom, according to U. N. figures, far below the 500 trucks of goods going in daily before the war and far below what aid groups say is needed. Almost the entire population of 2. 3 million depends on the trucks coming across the border for their survival. One in four Palestinians in Gaza is starving, and the rest face crisis levels of hunger, according to the U. N. More than 85% of people in Gaza have been driven from their homes by Israeli bombardment and ground offensives. Most live in U. N. shelters crowded beyond their capacity, in tent camps that have been sprung up, or on the streets. In Greece on Saturday, Blinken said his trip would be dominated by ""not necessarily easy conversations"" with allies and partners about what they are willing to do ""to build durable peace and security. ""Blinken's visit comes as developments in Lebanon, northern Israel, the Red Sea and Iraq have put intense strains on what had been a modestly successful U. S. push to prevent a regional conflagration since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, and as international criticism of Israel's military operation mounts. ""These are not necessarily easy conversations,"" he said in Greece. ""There are different perspectives, different needs, different requirements, but it is vital that we engage in this diplomacy now both for the sake of Gaza itself and more broadly the sake of the future for Israelis and Palestinians and for the region as a whole. ""He said his priorities are protecting civilians — ""far too many Palestinians have been killed"" — getting more humanitarian aid into Gaza, ensuring Hamas cannot strike again, and developing a framework for Palestinian-led governance in the territory and ""a Palestinian state with security assurances or Israel. ""Hours before Blinken's meetings on Saturday, Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah militia fired dozens of rockets at northern Israel and said the barrage was an initial response to the targeted killing, presumably by Israel, of a top leader from the allied Hamas group in Lebanon's capital this past week. Israel responded in what became one of the heaviest days of cross-border fighting in recent weeks. Meanwhile, stepped-up attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels have disrupted international trade and led to increased efforts by the U. S. and its allies to patrol the vital commercial waterway and respond to threats. The coalition of countries issued what amounted to a final warning to the Houthis on Wednesday to cease their attacks on vessels or face potential targeted military action. Since Dec. 19, the militants have carried out at least two dozen attacks in response to the Israel-Hamas war.",npr_articles/article_110.txt,npr_results/article_110.txt.json
111,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/06/1223290019/hezbollah-fires-rockets-northern-israel,"BEIRUT — Lebanon's Hezbollah militia fired dozens of rockets at northern Israel on Saturday, warning that the barrage was its initial response to the targeted killing, presumably by Israel, of a top leader from the allied Hamas group in Lebanon's capital earlier this week. The rocket attack came a day after Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said that his group must retaliate for the killing of Saleh Arouri, the deputy political leader of Hamas in a Hezbollah stronghold south of Beirut. Nasrallah said that if Hezbollah did not strike back, all of Lebanon would be vulnerable to Israeli attack. He appeared to be making his case for a response to the Lebanese public, even at the risk of escalating the fighting between Hezbollah and Israel as the war between Israel and Hamas rages on. Hezbollah said Saturday that it launched 62 rockets toward an Israeli air surveillance base on Mount Meron and that it scored direct hits. The group said rockets also struck two army posts near the border. The Israeli military said about 40 rockets were fired toward Meron and that a base was targeted, but made no mention of the base being hit. It said it struck the Hezbollah cell that fired the rockets. The cross-border escalation came as U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was kicking off an urgent Middle East diplomatic tour, his fourth to the region since the Israel-Hamas war erupted three months ago. The war was triggered by a deadly Hamas attack on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostages. In recent weeks, Israel has been scaling back its military assault in the north of the territory and pressing its heavy offensive in the south, vowing to crush Hamas. In the south, most of Gaza's 2. 3 million Palestinians are being squeezed into smaller areas in a humanitarian disaster, while still being pounded by Israeli airstrikes. On Saturday, the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said 122 Palestinians were killed over the past 24 hours, bringing the total since the start of the war to 22,722. The count does not differentiate between combatants and civilians. The ministry has said two-thirds of those killed have been women and children. The overall number of wounded rose to 58,166, the ministry said. In the southern city of Khan Younis, the focus of Israel's ground offensive, the local European Hospital received the bodies of 18 people killed in an overnight airstrike on a house in the city's Maan neighborhood, said Saleh al-Hamms, head of the nursing department at the hospital. Citing witnesses, he said more than three dozen people had been sheltering in the house, including those displaced, when it was hit. Israel has held Hamas responsible for civilian casualties, saying the group has embedded within in Gaza's civilian infrastructure. Still, international criticism of Israel's conduct in the war has grown more persistent because of the rising civilian death toll in Gaza. The United States has urged Israel to do more to prevent harm to civilians, even as it keeps sending weapons and munitions, while shielding its close ally against international censure. Blinken began his latest Mideast trip in Turkey on Saturday. The Biden administration believes that Turkey and others can exert influence, particularly on Iran and its proxies, to tamp down fears of a regional conflagration. Those fears have spiked in recent days with incidents in the Red Sea, Lebanon, Iraq and Iran. In talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Blinken will also be seeking Turkish support for still nascent plans for post-war Gaza that could include monetary or in-kind contributions to reconstruction efforts and some form of participation in a proposed multinational force that could operate in or adjacent to the territory. From Turkey, Blinken will travel to Turkish rival and fellow NATO ally Greece to meet Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis at his residence on the Mediterranean island of Crete. Mitsotakis and his government have been supportive of U. S. efforts to prevent the Israel-Hamas war from spreading and have signaled their willingness to assist should the situation deteriorate. Other stops on the trip include Jordan, followed by Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia on Sunday and Monday. Blinken will visit Israel and the West Bank next week before wrapping up the trip in Egypt.",npr_articles/article_111.txt,npr_results/article_111.txt.json
112,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/06/1223086658/gaza-governance-israel-hamas-palestinian-authority-voluntary-migration,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Competing visions for what postwar governance in Gaza could look like have emerged from Israeli officials this week, renewing debate both inside and outside Israel over what many have come to call plans for ""the day after. ""Most of the proposals from Israel and the U. S. say that Hamas should not be allowed to govern Gaza in the future, after the militant group's devastating Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which left 1,200 dead and hundreds kidnapped. The Hamas militant group has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. But many differ on who, instead, should retain administrative control over Gaza and to what extent Israel should be present in the territory. This week, two right-wing Israeli ministers called for the ""voluntary migration"" of Palestinians out of Gaza and allowing Israel to build settlements in the territory. The comments ignited international criticism, including from the U. S. State Department. On Thursday, Israel's more moderate defense minister, Yoav Gallant, released his plan for postwar Gaza, which calls for Palestinian control. Israel should have freedom to conduct military actions in Gaza, Gallant said. But Palestinians should control the territory, he added. Gallant did not offer specifics about what a Palestinian-led government would look like, beyond that it be led by ""local non-hostile actors,"" or how it could maintain its authority. ""Israel will not govern Gaza's civilians,"" Gallant's plan reads. ""Gaza residents are Palestinian, therefore Palestinian bodies will be in charge, with the condition that there will be no hostile actions or threats against the State of Israel. ""The Biden administration had previously suggested that the Palestinian Authority, which currently governs the West Bank, be installed in Gaza. But the Palestinian Authority and especially its president, Mahmoud Abbas, are unpopular among Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long criticized the Palestinian Authority's school curricula and policy to pay families of detainees held by Israel, has voiced opposition to the Biden plan. In a poll released in December by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, about 40% of Gaza residents preferred a postwar government that involved the Palestinian Authority, slightly more than the percentage who preferred one led by Hamas. Neither option reached a majority. ""Nobody will be accepted by Palestinian society unless Palestinians feel that that person is there to represent their will and they chose them,"" Palestinian activist Fadi Quran told NPR in December. Only 7% of respondents in Gaza said they hoped to see one or more Arab countries control Gaza after the war. ""If you cannot imagine Palestinian community or society or state without Hamas, then you need to give an alternative for the Palestinian people,"" said Majed al-Ansari, a spokesperson for Qatar's Foreign Ministry, in an interview in December with the British think tank Chatham House. ""And certainly, choosing on behalf of the Palestinians who will lead them has not worked in the past and will not work now. ""The new plan by Gallant came amid international outcry over comments this week from two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. The two ministers called for the ""voluntary migration"" of Palestinians out of Gaza and endorsed the construction of Israeli settlements in the territory. Israeli forces ""cannot withdraw from any territory — we are in the Gaza Strip,"" Ben-Gvir, Israel's national security minister, told reporters Monday. ""Not only do I not rule out Jewish settlement there — I believe it is also an important thing. ""Smotrich, the country's finance minister, made similar comments and has characterized the resettlement of Palestinians away from Gaza as a humanitarian solution. The comments drew a rare rebuke from the U. S. State Department in a statement Tuesday from spokesperson Matthew Miller. ""This rhetoric is inflammatory and irresponsible,"" Miller said. ""We have been told repeatedly and consistently by the Government of Israel, including by the Prime Minister, that such statements do not reflect the policy of the Israeli government. They should stop immediately. ""The European Union's top foreign policy official, Josep Borrell, echoed the criticism Wednesday. ""Forced displacements are strictly prohibited as a grave violation"" of international humanitarian law, he wrote in a statement on the social media platform X. ""Words matter. ""The ""day after"" issues extend far beyond who administers the territory and whether Israel's military should be allowed to conduct operations there. A key issue is the reconstruction of Gaza. No matter who helms the effort, rebuilding the territory will be a monumental task. As many as half of all buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed by Israel's bombardment, according to an analysis of satellite imagery by researchers at Oregon State University and the City University of New York. Funds for reconstruction are widely expected to come, in part, from oil-rich Arab countries in the Gulf. Gallant proposed a multinational task force to oversee the reconstruction, led by the U. S. in partnership with European and regional allies. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S. C. , in Israel this week, urged the revival of prospects of a Saudi-Israeli normalization deal that could see the Saudis involved in Gaza, he said. ""You can't have the foreign aid diverted to build tunnels, right? That model doesn't work. You've got to have someone taking over the Palestinian file that has money and will,"" Graham said.",npr_articles/article_112.txt,npr_results/article_112.txt.json
113,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/04/1222880864/after-striking-throughout-the-middle-east-irans-proxies-now-become-the-targets,"There's been a theme this week. On Thursday, the U. S. carried out a deadly drone strike against a militia group in Baghdad. A day earlier, the U. S. threatened tougher action against Houthi rebels in Yemen. And on Tuesday, a Hamas leader was killed in a drone strike in Beirut. The thread that ties these events together is Iran and its proxies. All these attacks or warnings are directed at Iran's broad network of militant groups that are spread across the Middle East. Iran has overseen a range of hardline factions for decades, and these groups have stepped up attacks over the past three months, ever since Hamas, a leading beneficiary of Iranian support, launched its assault on southern Israel on Oct. 7. Today, Iran supports groups attacking U. S. and Israeli forces in five separate places in the Middle East, according to U. S. and Israeli officials. Iran backs Hamas in the Israel-Gaza war. Iran supports Hezbollah in the daily rocket and missile exchange along the Israel-Lebanon border. Iran arms the Houthis, who are firing at commercial cargo ships, which are being protected by the U. S. Navy. And Iran is also the patron of smaller militias that have attacked U. S. troops repeatedly in Iraq and Syria, mostly with drones. Iran's longstanding goals are to undermine Israel and to drive U. S. forces out of the region. By design, Iran, a Persian nation, pursues this agenda with Arab proxy forces so Tehran can maintain an arm's length and not get directly involved in the fighting. Iran has ""very cautiously unleashed the whole network of armed gangs that they run in the Arab world that it calls 'the axis of resistance,'"" said Hussein Ibish of the Arab Gulf States Initiative in Washington. Tehran wants ""to use proxies in order to engage on various battlefields without it ever touching Iran or Iranians or without it coming close to the homeland,"" he added. However, there's been a shift in recent days. There's still no indication that Iran could become directly involved in any of the hostilities. But the U. S. has taken military action, and warned of further steps, that go beyond what's taken place the past three months. Consider the U. S. drone strike in Baghdad, which killed three members of the group Harakat al-Nujaba in a car outside an Iraqi security building. The faction  is on a list of U. S. terrorist groups. Still, a U. S. attack inside Iraq is out of the ordinary these days. Iraq is hosting the U. S. forces and an Iraqi government spokesman called the U. S. strike a ""flagrant violation of the sovereignty and security of Iraq. "" In the region's complicated web of relationships, the militia that the U. S. struck has ties to Iraq's security forces, and it's also backed by Iran, according to the Americans.  The U. S. airstrike took place after American troops at remote bases in Iraq and Syria have come under attack more than 100 times in recent weeks by various militants backed by Iran. In addition, the White House issued a warning Wednesday that it was prepared to step up action against the Houthis in Yemen. ""The Houthis will bear the responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy, and free flow of commerce in the region's critical waterways,"" the statement said. Iran has armed the group for years in Yemen's brutal civil war. Since November, the Houthis have been firing drones and missiles, and employed small attack boats against commercial cargo ships in the Red Sea off the southwest coast of Yemen. The U. S. Navy has intervened to beat back most of these attacks. But major commercial shippers, like Maersk, are now avoiding the Red Sea and taking a much longer and more expensive trip around the southern tip of Africa. The U. S. says Iran is providing the Houthis the weapons for these attacks, though Iran denies such involvement. ""If Iran didn't want the Houthis threatening maritime security in the Red Sea, they would have made that clear in one way or another, and the Houthis would have cut it out, but they haven't. So obviously, at a minimum, Iran is supportive of this,"" said Ibish. When regional tensions flare up, Israel and Hezbollah are prone to trade rocket and missile fire across the Israel-Lebanon border. But these exchanges have unwritten rules. Both sides often limit the shooting to areas near the border and seek to avoid escalation that could lead to full-scale fighting. Most analysts say this has been the case the past couple months, in part because Lebanon is in an economic crisis, and Israel is preoccupied with the war in Gaza. But a drone strike on Tuesday killed a senior Hamas leader, Saleh al-Arouri, while he was at a meeting in Lebanon's capital Beirut. Israel has not said whether it carried out the attack, but it has stated it would go after Hamas leaders wherever they might be in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack. If Israel was responsible, this would mark the first time it struck such a high-ranking Hamas figure in a foreign capital, raising the prospect of additional high-profile strikes. ""If the enemy considers waging a war against Lebanon, our battle will be without boundaries or rules,"" Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said Wednesday. ""We are not afraid of war. Those who think of going to war with us will regret it. War with us will come at a very, very, very high cost. "" The current Middle East turmoil demonstrates how disruptive Iran and its proxies can be. But this doesn't mean Iran has achieved its larger regional goals. Ironically, President Biden and his two predecessors, Donald Trump and Barack Obama, have all sought to shrink the U. S. military footprint in the Middle East. Yet recurring conflicts keep drawing the U. S. back in. Also, Israel expanded diplomatic relations and trade ties with Arab countries in recent years despite the Iranian efforts to counter any such moves.  In addition, the places where Iran has been most deeply involved are in crisis. They include Gaza, which has been run by Hamas. Lebanon, where Hezbollah is the leading powerbroker. And Yemen, where the Houthis are the dominant force. Still, Hussein Ibish believes Iran's takeaway from recent events is that the various groups increase Tehran's influence throughout the region. ""It's reinforced Iran's commitment to using proxy groups in the Arab world to get essentially fanatical Arabs to fight their wars for them,"" he said.

114,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/04/1222829998/gaza-city-israeli-troops,"TEL AVIV, Israel  — Israeli ground troops have withdrawn from some areas of Gaza City, a spokesperson for the municipality in the Hamas-run government said. The withdrawal comes as Israeli officials announced they would pull thousands of troops from the territory in preparation for a new phase in the war, which began on Oct. 7 when Hamas militants broke through the border and killed some 1,200 Israelis in towns and military bases nearby. Heavy fighting continues in the south. In the north, Israeli troops have left the western side of Gaza City, including the area around Al-Shifa Hospital, and the old central city, said Asem al-Nabeeh, a municipal spokesperson. It is now possible to travel safely to ""areas I was not able to reach before"" because they were too dangerous, he said. ""The level of destruction is massive in most of the places I went to,"" he said. ""I don't understand this level of targeting the infrastructure and houses. "" He was also finally able to reach his own home, he said, which was badly damaged when a neighbor's house was struck. ""A number of dead bodies were there,"" he added. Still, ground fighting and artillery shelling remain active in some parts of the city's east side, Nabeeh said. That includes Shijaiyah, where Nabeeh lives and where three Israeli hostages were shot and killed by an Israeli soldier last month. The Israeli military declined to comment on the specifics of its military operations. ""What we're seeing is success, really, in the northern part of Gaza, so that Hamas has pretty much lost control there,"" Dennis Ross, a longtime diplomat and fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told NPR. ""Because of that, the Israelis are shrinking the number of forces they have in Gaza because in a sense, they're concentrating more on other areas. ""The territory's most populous municipality before the war, Gaza City was the original focus of Israel's ground invasion. Troops reached the city in late October. Some of the most dramatic clashes and strikes of the war so far have taken place there, including the operation at Al-Shifa Hospital and airstrikes that destroyed ancient places of worship such as the Great Omari Mosque and the Church of Saint Porphyrius. For months, the fighting and airstrikes were so intense that almost all of the city's population fled south. Much of the city is unrecognizable and uninhabitable. More than 11,000 buildings in Gaza City were damaged or destroyed in the first 50 days of the war, according to an analysis published last month by the United Nations Satellite Center, and more strikes have landed in the weeks since. The departure of some troops from Gaza City has not given Nabeeh much relief, he said. ""I cannot feel happy while there is an ongoing military operation in other parts of Gaza,"" he said. ""What will make me happy is a full cease-fire, an independent Palestinian state and our right to self-determination. ""The focus of Israel's ground operation has shifted to southern Gaza, including in Khan Younis, where the Israeli military said Thursday that one division and two battalions were eliminating Hamas targets and infrastructure. Health ministry officials in Gaza say that more than 22,000 Palestinians have been killed since Oct. 7, a majority of them women or children.

115,https://www.npr.org/2024/01/03/1222605581/israel-troop-withdrawal-gaza-hamas-arouri-south-africa,"TEL AVIV, Israel — As Israel begins to wind down its air-and-ground assault in northern Gaza after weeks of fighting there, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is rejecting suggestions that the pullout of some troops is part of a wider plan to end the military campaign to eliminate Hamas. Earlier this week, Israel said it was withdrawing two brigades from Gaza, with three more brigades to be pulled out at a future date. That likely amounts to several thousand soldiers, although Israel has not disclosed how many total troops it has deployed to the Palestinian territory. Speaking during a visit with troops in central Gaza, Gallant said that an assumption that the withdrawal from the north presaged an end to the conflict was ""wrong. ""In a Tuesday evening briefing, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said Israel's military remains ""in a very high state of readiness in all arenas. """"In Gaza, our forces are continuing to fight, especially in the Khan Yunis area,"" he said. ""We are operating above and below ground, eliminating terrorists and continuing to destroy terrorist infrastructure. ""Hagari spoke a few hours after Israel announced that a senior Hamas leader, Saleh al-Arouri, had been killed in an explosion in Beirut. Arouri, the deputy head of Hamas' Lebanon-based political bureau, was the senior-most leader of the Islamist militant group killed since the war began. The conflict has been ongoing since Oct. 7, when Hamas militants breached the Gaza border, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostage, Israel says. Israel responded with airstrikes against Gaza, followed by a ground invasion that it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas. More than 22,000  Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in 12 weeks of fighting, Gaza's health ministry says. Meanwhile, Israel says it will appear before the United Nations' International Court of Justice in the Hague to defend itself against charges of genocide in Gaza. The case was filed last week by South Africa, which has asked the court to order Israel to immediately halt its military campaign in Gaza. Hearings are expected to begin next week.

Now, he's one of more than a million Palestinians displaced in Gaza. And like the many others living in the now packed southern city of Rafah, his life revolves around a daily struggle to survive. But the trained artist still finds himself drawn to paints and pens. He spoke to NPR producer Anas Baba inside the tent where he now lives – with areas to sleep, go to the bathroom and draw each partitioned with blankets. ""My primary concern is my children and how to provide them with a decent life, or at least a part of the life I wished for them. But I found that my soul is still attached to art,"" El Maqosui said. He sat on a mat on the ground and painted two long, human faces in black watercolor. Some of the work he's done since the war started shows the fear on the faces of strangers. Other, more abstract, drawings show the chaos and destruction of airstrikes. Every day, El Maqosui wakes up before dawn to stand in line with hundreds of others to get jugs of water. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are crammed into the small border city of Rafah, where extreme overcrowding is leading to disease and starvation. Israel's military has also continued to carry out airstrikes in Rafah, despite telling people to seek refuge there. Back home in northern Gaza, El Maqosui has a studio full of his paintings, where he and his family sheltered at the beginning of the war. But the studio is directly next to al Shifa hospital in Gaza City – the site of a massive Israeli military raid and firefights in November. Israel says Hamas was using the hospital and tunnels beneath it. El Maqosui suspects his life's work was destroyed in that raid. ""The biggest problem in our lives as artists, it's not just our homes or our lives that are lost through the destruction of our homes, but also our work,"" El Maqosui said. After arriving in Rafah, he managed to find some sketchbooks, and he had brought a few of his own paints. But he's stopped using most of the colors he took with him. Now, he mostly uses black and gray, because they're a better reflection of the destruction surrounding him, he says. El Maqosui says if he survives the war, he will paint the art he's created in this tent on larger canvases. But for now, painting and drawing in this sketchbook is how he releases his anger. ""I walk on the streets, and every face I see is angry – men, women, young, old, everyone's faces show anger,"" El Maqosui said. ""There's no beauty left to see in Gaza.

Saleh Arouri was one of the founders of Hamas' military wing and a deputy chief of the group's political bureau. Israel has not taken responsibility for the attack. But if later confirmed, it would be the country's first assassination of a top Hamas official since the start of the war in Gaza in October. Hamas' Al-Aqsa TV channel announced the killing Tuesday in what it called a ""Zionist strike. "" Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said an alleged Israeli drone strike caused an explosion in one of Beirut's southern suburbs, killing four people. Israeli leaders vowed after Hamas' deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel that they would assassinate leaders of the organization in any country they found them. Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah militia, backed by Iran, said if Israel did kill Hamas leaders, it would retaliate. Hezbollah and Israel have so far been attacking each other near the Israel-Lebanon border since the war in Gaza began. Other militant Palestinian factions said they would respond with full force to Tuesday's reported assassination of Arouri. Arouri had been jailed by Israel and was deported to Turkey after being released in 2010. In Beirut, he served as a liaison between Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as with Turkey and other countries. Arouri was also involved in reconciliation efforts between Hamas and the rival Palestinian political party Fatah. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said Tuesday's blast was sure to drag Lebanon into a new phase of conflict.

The confirmation of the planned troop drawdown came the same day that Israel's Supreme Court struck down a key component of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's contentious judicial overhaul plan. While the plan is not directly connected to the war effort, it was the source of deep divisions inside Israel and had threatened the military's readiness before the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that triggered the ongoing war. Politicians warned against reigniting those divisions and harming the national unity that has prevailed throughout the Israel-Hamas war. Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead with the military offensive until Hamas is crushed and the more than 100 hostages still held by the militant group in Gaza are freed. But Israel has come under growing international pressure to scale back an offensive that has led to the deaths of nearly 22,000 Palestinians. U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has repeatedly urged Israel to do more to protect Palestinian civilians, is expected in the region next week. In its announcement, the army said that five brigades, or several thousand troops, would be taken out of Gaza in the coming weeks. Some will return to bases for further training or rest, while many older reservists will go home. The war has taken a toll on the economy by preventing reservists from going to their jobs, running their businesses or returning to university studies. The army's chief spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, did not say whether the withdrawal of some troops reflected a new phase of the war. ""The objectives of the war require prolonged fighting, and we are preparing accordingly,"" he told reporters late Sunday. But the move is in line with the plans that Israeli leaders have outlined for a low-intensity campaign, expected to last for much of the year, that focuses on remaining Hamas strongholds and ""pockets of resistance. ""Israel has said it's close to operational control over most of northern Gaza, reducing the need for forces there. Yet fierce fighting has continued in other areas of the Palestinian territory, especially the south, where many of Hamas' forces remain intact and where most of Gaza's 2. 3 million people have fled. Israel has vowed to crush Hamas' military and governing capabilities in the ongoing war, which was sparked by the militant group's Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and 240 others were taken hostage. Israel responded with an air, ground and sea offensive that has killed more than 21,900 people in Gaza, two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count. The Israeli military says 173 soldiers have died since it launched its ground operation. Israel also says, without providing evidence, that more than 8,000 militants have been killed. It blames Hamas for the high civilian death toll, saying the militants embed within residential areas, including schools and hospitals. The war has displaced some 85% of Gaza's population, forcing tens of thousands of people in overcrowded shelters or teeming tent camps in Israeli-designated safe areas that the military has nevertheless bombed. Palestinians are left with a sense that nowhere is safe. With tensions high across the region, the United States announced Monday that it would send an aircraft carrier strike group home and replace it with an amphibious assault ship and accompanying warships. In Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza that Israel says is a key Hamas stronghold, residents reported airstrikes and shelling in the west and center of the city. Combat was also reported in urban refugee camps in central Gaza, where Israel expanded its offensive last week. An Associated Press reporter saw at least 17 bodies, including those of four children, at a hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah after a missile struck a house. ""It's our routine: bombings, massacres and martyrs,"" said Saeed Moustafa, a Palestinian from the Nuseirat camp. Gaza's Health Ministry said Monday that 156 people had been killed in the past day. The Israeli military said an airstrike killed Adel Mismah, a regional commander of Hamas' elite Nukhba forces, in Deir al-Balah. In Israel, Kibbutz Be'eri, one of the communities hit by Hamas on Oct. 7, announced Monday that Ilan Weiss, who was thought to have been kidnapped, is now believed to be dead. Weiss' daughter, Noga Weiss, 18; and wife, Shiri Weiss, 53; were held in captivity in Gaza and released on Nov. 25 during a weeklong cease-fire. The Israeli Supreme Court's landmark decision to strike down part of Netanyahu's planned judicial overhaul could reopen the fissures in Israeli society that preceded the war against Hamas. The plan sparked months of mass protests and rattled the cohesion of Israel's military. Those divisions were largely put aside after Oct. 7. Benny Gantz, a rival of Netanyahu's who joined the three-member War Cabinet, called on all sides to put aside their differences and focus on the war. ""These are not days for political arguments. There are no winners and losers today,"" he said. In Monday's decision, the court narrowly voted to overturn a law that prevents judges from striking down government decisions they deem ""unreasonable. "" The law passed in July was the first part of the government's plan to curb the authority of unelected judges. The fighting in Gaza has threatened to spread across the region. Israel has engaged in near-daily battles with Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, to Israel's north, and struck Iranian-linked targets in neighboring Syria as well. Israel's warplanes and drones struck several areas in southern Lebanon, including a strike on the village of Kfar Kila that killed three people, state media and security officials said. Hezbollah said the three were some of its fighters. Since the latest exchange of fire began along the Lebanon-Israel border on Oct. 8, 133 Hezbollah fighters and around 20 civilians have been killed in Lebanon. Meanwhile, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have fired long-range missiles at Israel and attacked civilian cargo ships in the Red Sea. The United States has sent warships to the Mediterranean and Red Seas, providing protection for Israel and underscoring concerns that the fighting could widen. On Monday, the U. S. Navy announced that after months of extra duty at sea, the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier strike group would head home. The Ford will be replaced by the amphibious assault ship the USS Bataan and its accompanying warships.",npr_articles/article_118.txt,npr_results/article_118.txt.json

The military said Israeli forces were operating in Gaza's second-largest city, Khan Younis, and residents reported strikes in the central region, the latest focus of the nearly three-month air and ground war that has raised fears of a regional conflagration. The U. S. military said Sunday that its forces killed several Iran-backed Houthi rebels when they tried to attack a cargo ship in the Red Sea, an escalation in a maritime conflict linked to the war in Gaza. And an Israeli Cabinet minister suggested encouraging Gaza's population to emigrate in remarks that could worsen tensions with Egypt and other friendly Arab states. Israel says it wants to destroy Hamas' governing and military capabilities in Gaza, from where it launched its Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. The militants killed some 1,200 people and took about 240 others hostage that day after breaking through Israel's extensive border defenses, shattering its sense of security. Israel's unprecedented air and ground offensive has killed more than 21,800 Palestinians and wounded more than 56,000 others, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths. The war has sparked a humanitarian crisis, with a quarter of Gaza residents facing starvation, according to the United Nations. Israel's bombardments have leveled vast swaths of the territory, displacing some 85% of Gaza's 2. 3 million residents. Israel expanded its offensive to central Gaza this week, targeting a belt of dense, built-up communities that house refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation and their descendants. In the area of Zweida in central Gaza, an Israeli airstrike killed at least 13 people and wounded dozens of others, according to witnesses. The bodies were draped in white plastic and laid out in front of a hospital, where prayers were held before burial. ""They were innocent people,"" said Hussein Siam, whose relatives were among the dead. ""Israeli warplanes bombarded the whole family. ""Officials from Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Deir al-Balah said the 13 were among 35 bodies received on Sunday. The Israeli military said it was battling militants in Khan Younis, where Israel believes Hamas leaders are hiding. It also said its forces operating in the urban Shati refugee camp, in northern Gaza, found a bomb in a kindergarten and defused it. Hamas continued to launch rockets toward southern Israel. Israel has faced stiff resistance from Hamas since it began its ground offensive in late October, and the military says 172 soldiers have been killed during that time. The fighting has pushed much of the population south, where people have flooded shelters and tent camps near the border with Egypt, even as Israel has also struck those areas. The scale of the destruction and the exodus to the south has raised fears among Palestinians and Arab countries that Israel plans to drive Gaza's population out and prevent it from returning. On Sunday, Israel's far-right finance minister said it should ""encourage migration"" from Gaza and re-establish Jewish settlements in the territory, from which it withdrew settlers and soldiers in 2005. ""If in Gaza there were only 100,000 or 200,000 Arabs and not 2 million, the entire discussion about 'the day after' would be completely different,"" Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told Army Radio. Smotrich has been largely sidelined by a War Cabinet that does not include him. But his comments risked worsening tensions with neighboring Egypt, which is deeply concerned about a possible mass influx of Palestinian refugees, as well as other friendly Arab countries. Israel is also at odds with the United States, which has provided crucial military aid for the offensive, over Gaza's future. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel must maintain open-ended security control over the Gaza Strip. At a news conference Saturday, he said the war would continue for ""many more months"" and that Israel would assume control of the Gaza side of the border with Egypt. Israel says Hamas has smuggled weapons from Egypt, but Egypt is likely to oppose any Israeli military presence there. Netanyahu has also said he won't allow the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority, which administers some parts of the occupied West Bank, to expand its limited rule to Gaza, from where Hamas drove its forces out in 2007. The U. S. wants a unified Palestinian government to run both Gaza and parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank as a precursor to eventual statehood. The last Israeli-Palestinian peace talks broke down over a decade ago, and Israeli governments since then have been staunchly opposed to Palestinian statehood. Israelis, still largely united behind the war's goals, are showing signs they are losing patience. On Saturday night, thousands took part in one of the largest demonstrations against Netanyahu since the war began. The country is still sharply divided over the long-serving leader and a judicial overhaul plan he set in motion before the war. ""Prime Minister Netanyahu and his continued rule is the most significant existential threat to our country and our society,"" said protester Gal Tzur. A separate protest Saturday called for the release of the estimated 129 remaining hostages held by Hamas. Families of hostages and their supporters have demanded that the government prioritize hostage releases over other war objectives, and have staged large protests every weekend. Egypt, one of the mediators between Israel and Hamas, has proposed a multistage plan that would kick off with a swap of hostages for prisoners, accompanied by a temporary cease-fire. A similar deal in November saw Hamas free over 100 hostages and Israel release 240 Palestinian prisoners. But the sides still appear far from striking a new deal. Both Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group say no more hostages will be freed until Israel ends the offensive and withdraws from Gaza.",npr_articles/article_119.txt,npr_results/article_119.txt.json
120,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/30/1222278024/gaza-airstrikes-us-weapons-sales-israel,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli warplanes struck two urban refugee camps in central Gaza on Saturday, as the Biden administration approved a new emergency weapons sale to Israel despite persistent international cease-fire calls over mounting civilian deaths, hunger and mass displacement in the enclave. Even a brief halt in fighting seems out of reach. A senior Hamas official told The Associated Press in Beirut on Saturday that the group has not budged from its position that a permanent cease-fire has to be the starting point for any further releases of Israeli and foreign hostages the group holds, which runs counter to a recent proposal by Egypt for a staged end to the war. It's a demand Israel is bound to reject. Israel has said it will pursue its unprecedented air and ground offensive until it has dismantled Hamas, a goal viewed by some as unattainable because of the militant group's deep roots in Palestinian society. The United States has shielded Israel diplomatically and has continued to supply weapons. Israel argues that ending the war now would mean victory for Hamas, a stance shared by the Biden administration which at the same time urged Israel to do more to avoid harm to Palestinian civilians. The war, triggered by the deadly Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel, has displaced some 85% of the Gaza Strip's 2. 3 million residents, sending swells of people seeking shelter in Israeli-designated safe areas that the military has nevertheless also bombed. That has left Palestinians with a harrowing sense that nowhere is safe in the tiny enclave. The Health Ministry in Gaza said Saturday that the Palestinian death toll since the start of the war rose to 21,672, with a further 56,165 people wounded during the same period. Over the past 24 hours, 165 people were killed, said ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra. The ministry does not distinguish between the deaths of combatants and civilians, but has said about 70% of those killed have been women and children. Some of the latest deaths were reported as Israeli airstrikes targeted the urban refugee camps of Nuseirat and Bureij overnight and into Saturday. Nuseirat resident Mustafa Abu Wawee said a strike hit the home of one of his relatives, killing two people. ""The (Israeli) occupation is doing everything to force people to leave,"" he said over the phone while searching along with others for four people missing under the rubble. ""They want to break our spirit and will but they will fail. We are here to stay. ""A second strike late Friday in Nuseirat targeted the home of a journalist for Al-Quds TV, a channel linked to the group Islamic Jihad whose militants also participated in the Oct. 7 attack. The channel said the journalist, Jaber Abu Hadros and six members of his family were killed. Bureij resident Rami Abu Mosab said sounds of gunfire echoed across the camp overnight, followed by heavy airstrikes Saturday. With Israeli forces pushing deeper into Khan Younis and the camps of central Gaza, tens of thousands of Palestinians streamed into the already crowded city of Rafah at the southernmost end of Gaza in recent days. Drone footage showed a vast camp of thousands of tents and makeshift shacks set up on what had been empty land on Rafah's western outskirts next to U. N. warehouses. People arrived in Rafah in trucks, in carts and on foot. Those who did not find space in the already overwhelmed shelters put up tents on roadsides slick with mud from winter rains. The State Department said Friday that Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Congress he approved a $147. 5 million sale for equipment, including fuses, charges and primers, that is needed for 155 mm shells Israel bought previously. It marked the second time this month that the Biden administration is bypassing Congress to approve an emergency weapons sale to Israel. The department cited the ""urgency of Israel's defensive needs"" as a reason for the approval. Blinken made a similar decision on Dec. 9 to approve the sale to Israel of nearly 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition worth more than $106 million. Both moves have come as President Joe Biden's request for a nearly $106 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other national security needs remains stalled in Congress, caught up in a debate over U. S. immigration policy and border security. Some Democratic lawmakers have spoken of making the proposed $14. 3 billion in American assistance to its Mideast ally contingent on concrete steps by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to reduce civilian casualties in Gaza during the war with Hamas. More than a week after a U. N. Security Council resolution called for the unhindered delivery of aid at scale across besieged Gaza, conditions have only worsened, U. N. agencies warned. Aid officials said the aid entering Gaza remains woefully inadequate. Distributing goods is hampered by long delays at two border crossings, ongoing fighting, Israeli airstrikes, repeated cuts in internet and phone services and a breakdown of law and order that makes it difficult to secure aid convoys, they said. Nearly the entire population is fully dependent on outside humanitarian aid, said Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, the U. N. agency for Palestinian refugees. A quarter of the population is starving because too few trucks enter with food, medicine, fuel and other supplies — sometimes fewer than 100 trucks a day, according to U. N. daily reports. U. N. monitors said operations at the Israeli-run Kerem Shalom crossing halted for four days this week because of security incidents, such as a drone strike and the seizing of aid by desperate Gaza residents. They said the crossing reopened Friday, and that a total of 81 aid trucks entered Gaza through Kerem Shalom and the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border — a fraction of the typical prewar volume of 500 trucks a day. Israeli officials, meanwhile, have vowed to bring back more than 100 hostages still held in Gaza, after militants seized more than 240 in the Oct. 7 assault that also killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. The military says 168 of its soldiers have been killed since the ground offensive began. Mediator Egypt has proposed a multi-stage plan that would kick off with a swap of hostages for prisoners, accompanied by a temporary cease-fire — along the lines of an exchange during a weeklong truce in November. In a subsequent phase, talks would begin on forming a transitional Palestinian government of experts who would run both Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel and Hamas remain far apart on the terms of a cease-fire and future swaps. ""We have been clear that a complete cease-fire is the first step,"" Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official in Beirut, said Saturday. It's a position that seemingly derails the Egyptian plan, though Hamdan also said conversations are continuing. ""There are also ideas we have received through our brothers in Qatar, and we have not given any final answer so far,"" he said. ""This may take some time. We are keen to talk about the details, because the idea put forward today may develop in different ways and may no longer be raised at all.

121,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/29/1221571110/gaza-water-israel-crisis-hamas,"RAFAH, Gaza Strip — For Nidal Al Barrawi, his wife and eight children, the struggle to get enough water in Gaza has become a big part of the family's daily routine. The family fled to Rafah, near the Egyptian border, in recent weeks as fighting intensified around their home in northern Gaza. Now, just filling containers with the 20 liters (5 gallons) they can get per day for drinking, cooking and bathing means waiting in line from early morning until noon at a water distribution point. Still, he says, ""it is not enough for the children. "" It's not enough for him or his wife, either. ""Personally, I haven't had a shower in 20 days due to lack of water,"" he says. The United Nations recommends a minimum of 50 liters (13 gallons) of water per day per person for drinking, cooking and bathing. But like Barrawi and his family, most are making do with a fraction of that. The Gaza Strip has no streams, lakes or other surface sources of water. In the years prior to the war, water for bathing and laundry in the Palestinian territory has come mostly from a coastal aquifer that had become contaminated. About 97% of the water from that source doesn't meet World Health Organization standards for human consumption, the U. N. says. So for its drinking water, Gaza has come to rely almost entirely on more than 150 desalination plants built in the last decade, about 80% of them privately run. About 90% of Gaza's households purchase their potable water from these desalination plants, according to the U. N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in 2019. Two Israeli pipelines also supply some potable water. The pipelines were shut down in the first few weeks of the war, but have now been restarted, according to Israel's Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories office. The sole desalination plant still operating in Rafah, where most of Gaza's internally displaced population is now concentrated, is operated by Eta Water Company.  The plant's senior manager, Yousef Abdul Salam Yaseen, says the facility used to serve some of the 300,000 people in the region. But since the start of the war, the population of Rafah has ballooned to 1. 5 million as people fled southward to escape the fighting. ""We can't produce enough water for them,"" Yaseen says. ""But we are doing everything we can. ""He cites a shortage of fuel to run the generators needed for the power-intensive process to purify water, known as reverse osmosis. The plant, and others like it, take in water from the Mediterranean Sea, pump it up to very high pressure and then push it through an ultra-fine membrane to remove salt and other contaminants. Eta owns three desalination plants in Gaza. The other two — one near Gaza City and another in Jabaliya in northern Gaza — are offline, Yaseen says. ""One was bombed. The other, we don't have any information on. ""Before the war, about 500 trucks a day crossed into Gaza, providing fuel and other supplies. On a good day now, only about 100 arrive. So, there's just not enough fuel to go around, Yaseen says. The water situation in Gaza was fragile even before Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that killed 1,200 people, according to Israel. In its subsequent air-and-ground attack on Gaza, Israel has killed more than 21,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities, and knocked out power to much of the Gaza Strip. Catherine Russell, the executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF, warned earlier this month that access to clean water had become so limited that ""children in Gaza have barely a drop to drink. ""UNRWA, the U. N. agency providing relief to Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip, says 70% of the population is drinking salty and contaminated water. That concern is echoed by Pedro Arrojo Agudo, the U. N. special rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation. In the absence of alternatives, he says, ""of course they are drinking contaminated water with all the risks. "" Those risks include cholera and other waterborne diseases, he says. Israeli troops and settlers occupied the Gaza Strip from 1967 until 2005, when Israel pulled out of the territory. Ran Suckeveriene, the head of the water engineering department at Israel's Kinneret Academic College, says when Israel disengaged from Gaza, the water infrastructure there was in good shape. Clean drinking water could still be drawn from the coastal aquifer, he says, and sanitation facilities were treating wastewater. ""They didn't manage it well,"" he says of the Gazans after Israel left. He says the government in Gaza allowed thousands of illegal wells to be drilled, depleting the coastal aquifer. Without proper waste treatment facilities, it then became contaminated, he says. ""Not only did they not take care of the water pumping"" from wells, but they ""allowed the water to become contaminated,"" with seawater and untreated sewage, he says. Israel has long complained about untreated sewage seeping across the border and being flushed directly into the sea, washing up on its beaches. But with Israel's blockade of Gaza and its ban on the entry of ""dual use"" items — deemed to have both civilian and military applications — into the Strip, maintaining drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities has been difficult. As NPR reported last year, Israel has blocked cement to build new sewage treatment plants and spare parts to keep existing ones operating. Israel also says Hamas is using water pipes to make rockets that the militant group uses to target Israeli territory. Depending on how much damage has been done to desalination plants, it could take a long time to get Gaza's water infrastructure up and running again after the war is over, says Peter Gleick, a senior fellow and co-founder of the Pacific Institute, a non-profit water think tank. ""It's going to take a lot of money. Repairing Gaza's water system is not just getting the sources back online, but it's getting the infrastructure to deliver the water back in place,"" he says. That means water mains, many of which may have been damaged or destroyed during Israel's bombardment, Gleick says. But if the desalination plants aren't damaged, ""it's just a question of getting fuel to them so that they can operate, getting the energy to them so they can be turned back on,"" he says. Until then, Gleick says, ""it's going to be humanitarian aid in the form of bottled water. ""NPR producer Anas Baba reported from Rafah.

122,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/29/1219717852/2-bitter-wars-with-a-long-history-and-no-solution-in-sight,"Editor's Note: NPR's Greg Myre has covered many wars, and this year he's reported from both the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Israel-Hamas fighting. As the year winds down, he offers this look at where these wars stand and the prospects for finding a permanent solution. When I called author and historian Anne Applebaum to talk about the wars currently raging, she took the long view and offered this stark assessment. ""I think we've reached the end of a particular period in history when it was even possible to talk about some kind of universal values or rules,"" said Applebaum. I've seen this lack of restraints when reporting on Russia's invasion in Ukraine. The evidence is the deserted Ukrainian towns and villages, the scorched homes, the abducted children and mass graves in communities across the country. Applebaum, who writes for The Atlantic, sees Russia's actions as part of a broader move by autocratic leaders and extremist groups that reject many of the norms established by Western nations in the aftermath of World War II, such as the Geneva Conventions. ""The (Russian) tactics have been to hit civilians, hit sites of industrial production, hit the electricity grid, hit hospitals,"" she said. ""The war in Ukraine is really an attack on those laws, on that system itself. ""In covering the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict several recurring themes keep jumping out. Both wars stretch back generations. What we're witnessing is just the latest eruption. Modern weaponry makes them deadlier, and accumulated hatreds make them harder than ever to resolve. At an Israeli military center, I saw a 45-minute video with gruesome scenes of Hamas militants rampaging through southern Israel. Much of the footage is from Hamas militants wearing body cameras, filming themselves as they slaughtered Israeli civilians. In its response, Israel's military says its operation in Gaza targets Hamas, not Palestinian civilians. Yet this is the fourth Israeli conflict I've covered. Israel has never unleashed such a massive bombing campaign in such a densely packed civilian area as it's doing daily in Gaza — with predictable results — the deaths of thousands of women and children. Ian Bremmer, a global affairs analyst and president of the Eurasia Group, sees two wars that will be very hard to solve. ""The Ukrainians believe a genocide has been committed against them, and the Russians don't think Ukraine has a right to exist,"" said Bremmer. ""Historically, Israel-Palestine has been the most challenging geopolitical issue out there. And I don't think it's getting any easier with this war. ""In some ways, the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be moving further from a solution. They fought their first war in 1948. Now, 75 years later, the leading Palestinian faction, Hamas, wants to destroy Israel. Israel's long-serving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who's been in power on and off since 1996, vows to eradicate Hamas. No serious negotiations have taken place in years, and during my most recent time in the Middle East, I was struck by how views have hardened across the spectrum. They have shifted even among those favoring a peaceful settlement. ""Look, we need a new administration in Gaza,"" said Erel Margalit, a leading Israeli high-tech entrepreneur who heads Jerusalem Venture Partners. He used to be in parliament, the Knesset, with the liberal Labor Party, which supports a Palestinian state. He still holds that view, but says both sides need new leadership. He says Netanyahu, who's been in power for 13 of the past 15 years, needs to go. And Margalit also says Hamas needs to be replaced with a ""Palestinian administration that's willing to build life rather than death, willing to build schools which don't have ammunition right underneath them, willing to build hospitals, which don't have a terror maze of tunnels right underneath them. ""In the past, I traveled to Gaza dozens of times on my own. Now, Israel's bombing campaign has made it too dangerous. The military has only taken journalists into the territory on brief, chaperoned visits. NPR's Palestinian producer Anas Baba, has been our eyes and ears in Gaza. He described his devastated hometown, Gaza City, this way:""This is not my city. I cannot even realize what street it is. I only can smell death. Dead bodies under the rubbles. Nothing is the same,"" Baba said. The story of the intractable Israeli-Palestinian feud is well known. Far fewer know the history of the Russia-Ukraine dispute. Ukraine declared independence from Russia shortly after the 1917 Russian Revolution, but didn't manage to breakaway until the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991. That Ukrainian independence has been under assault since Russia's Vladimir Putin invaded in 2014. Dmitri Alperovitch, who was born in Russia, now heads a Washington think tank, the Silverado Policy Accelerator. He's a fierce critic of Putin. ""For Putin, it's really not about whether he can capture a village and keep it occupied,"" said Alperovitch. ""His determination from day one has been to control Ukraine, to prevent Ukraine from being part of the Western alliance. ""Ukraine wants to recapture lost territory. More importantly, he says, it seeks the long-term protection that would come with membership in NATO. ""What Ukraine really wants is stability and security for its country to prevent another invasion from Russia. And that's much more challenging to achieve,"" said Alperovitch, author of the forthcoming book, World on the Brink: The United States, China, and the Race for the 21st Century. The U. S. plays a critical role in both wars, yet may not be able to forge the outcome it wants in either conflict. One reason is that U. S. foreign policy has become much more fickle. Once upon a time, Democrats and Republicans worked together on foreign policy under the notion that ""politics end at the water's edge. ""Not anymore, says Anne Applebaum. ""In an era of really harsh partisanship, it will be much more difficult to maintain a consistent foreign policy over time,"" she said. President Biden's plan to send more military aid to Ukraine is now being blocked by Republicans. Biden's strong backing for Israel faces pushback from many in his own party — who say he should do more for the stateless Palestinians. ""The assumption that the U. S. could at least be relied on to have the same policy over several different administrations, that probably belongs to the past,"" said Appelbaum. Ian Bremmer acknowledges the difficulties in settling these conflicts. But he says the only real hope is for the U. S. to be fully engaged. ""A world where you don't have global leadership, where the United States is increasingly unwilling to be the promoter of global values, you will get more conflict. ""Today there are calls for cease-fires and peace talks. But both wars are a long, long way from there to a permanent solution.

123,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/28/1221952425/israeli-strikes-gaza-palestinians-killed,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli forces bombarded cities, towns and refugee camps across Gaza overnight and into Thursday, killing dozens of people in an air and ground offensive against Hamas that has widened to most of the territory and forced thousands more to flee from homes and shelters. The war has already killed over 20,000 Palestinians and driven around 85% of the population of 2. 3 million from their homes. Much of northern Gaza has been leveled, largely depopulated and isolated from the rest of the territory for weeks. Many fear a similar fate awaits the south. Israel has vowed to dismantle Hamas — which is still putting up stiff resistance, even in the north — and bring back more than 100 hostages still held by the militants after their Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel, in which some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed. Israel has brushed off international calls for a cease-fire — saying it would amount to a victory for Hamas. The United States — while providing crucial support for the offensive — has urged Israel to take greater measures to spare civilians and allow in more aid. But aid workers say the amount of food, fuel and medical supplies entering is still far below what is needed, and 1 in 4 Palestinians in Gaza are starving, according to U. N. officials. An Israeli airstrike on a home in the northern town of Beit Lahiyeh — one of the first targets of the ground invasion that began in October — buried at least 21 people, including women and children, according to a family member. Bassel Kheir al-Din, a journalist with a local TV station, said the strike flattened his family house and severely damaged three neighboring homes. He said 12 members of his family — including three children aged 2, 7 and 8 — were buried and presumed dead, and that nine neighbors were missing. In central Gaza, Israeli warplanes and artillery pounded the built-up Bureij and Nuseirat refugee camps, leveling buildings, residents said. Israel said this week it would expand its ground offensive into central Gaza, and typically launches waves of airstrikes and shelling before troops and tanks move in. A hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah received the bodies of 25 people killed overnight, including five children and seven women, hospital records showed on Thursday. Nonstop explosions could be heard throughout the night in the town — where hundreds of thousands of people have sought shelter, with many spending cold nights sleeping on sidewalks. ""It was another night of killing and massacres,"" said Saeed Moustafa, a resident of the Nuseirat camp. He said people were still crying out from the rubble of a house hit by an airstrike on Wednesday. ""We are unable to get them out. We hear their screams but we don't have equipment,"" he said. Farther south, in Khan Younis, the Palestinian Red Crescent said a strike near its Al-Amal Hospital killed at least 10 people and wounded another 12. Much of the city's population has left, but many are sheltering near Al-Amal and another hospital, hoping they will be spared from the bombardment. Rami Abu Mosab, who lives in the Bureij refugee camp, said thousands of people have fled their homes in recent days because of the intense bombardment. He plans to remain there because he doesn't feel that anywhere in Gaza is safe. ""Here is death and there is death,"" he said, ""To die in your home is better. ""Bureij and Nuseirat are among several camps across the region that were built to house hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. They have since grown into crowded residential neighborhoods. Some 700,000 Palestinian fled or were driven from their homes during that conflict, an exodus the Palestinians refer to as the Nakba, or catastrophe. Some 1. 9 million have been displaced within Gaza since Oct. 7. As Israel has broadened its offensive, fleeing Palestinians have packed into areas along the Egyptian border and the southern Mediterranean coastline, where shelters and tent camps are overflowing. Even in those areas, Israel continues to strike what it says are militant targets. The Israeli military blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas, which positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in dense residential areas. But the military rarely comments on individual strikes. Israel's offensive in Gaza has already been one of the most devastating military campaigns in recent history. More than 21,100 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza. The count doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants. The military says it has killed thousands of militants, without presenting evidence, and that 167 of its soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive.",npr_articles/article_123.txt,npr_results/article_123.txt.json
124,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/27/1219008604/israel-military-service-soldier-gaza-hamas-war,"HERZLIYA, Israel — Alon Keren, 21, spent two weeks in uniform inside Gaza, then got a two-day furlough last month when Israel and Hamas agreed to a brief cease-fire. ""First thing was the laundry,"" he says about his quick visit home, sitting in the backyard of his parents' house in Herzliya next to a heat lamp and citrus trees. ""Good showers, good food, good sleep, good friends. ""He had to report back to Gaza the following morning. Keren is one of hundreds of thousands of reservists who have been called up to serve in the Israeli army following Hamas' Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel, which Israel says killed 1,200 people. His job is to bring supplies in and out of Gaza for the 20 combat soldiers in his commando unit. ""Someone had to do it,"" he says. ""It's a small job, but in the end it helps. ""Keren spoke with NPR on Nov. 25, nearly one month into Israel's ground invasion of Gaza. Today, the ground invasion has lasted two months, and Keren is still there. By now, the military says more than 160 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza. Troops recently killed three Israeli hostages by accident. Gaza health officials say more than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began. Keren's firsthand experiences of the war in Gaza are vastly different from those of the 2 million Palestinians struggling to survive under bombardment — and from the experiences of soldiers fighting on the front lines. But his account will sound familiar for those who have served in uniform: the routine, the waiting around, the blunders and small annoyances, the camaraderie with his friends in the unit, and the sense of disconnect from a wider perspective of the war. Below are his early impressions. Every few days, Keren and his team drive back into Israel for a couple of hours, to a small military position along the border, with equipment to repair: damaged weapons and drones that either malfunctioned or that soldiers accidentally shot out of the sky, mistaking them for Hamas drones. ""It's like a routine for me,"" Keren says. ""Almost every day we have a mission, which takes something like three to seven hours, and we do that. It's like, to drive from from one place to another and take the soldiers . . . to take equipment from Israel to Gaza, from Gaza to Israel. ""While they're at the barracks in Israel, they have a chance to take a shower and access their cell phones, to tell their parents and friends they're all right. On one of those quick trips back across the border, Israeli standup comic Guy Hochman paid a visit. He has been entertaining the troops inside Gaza and along the border, posting videos of his encounters to cheer up the soldiers' worried friends back home. ""Taking a break from Gaza!"" the comic says in one Instagram video, with Keren and his fellow soldiers seen cheering in the background. When the soldiers are ready to return to Gaza, they re-deposit their phones at the barracks and drive back in Humvees with supplies for the other troops: food, water, hand sanitizer, wet wipes, beef jerky, snacks and chocolate. Keren declines to describe his commando unit's specific missions, except to say the combat soldiers are dispatched throughout Gaza to carry out 24- to 48-hour raids. Sometimes he evacuates soldiers lightly wounded from shrapnel, rushing them to a helicopter pad in Gaza to be airlifted into Israel or driving them across the border to ambulances that take them to hospitals. More than 100 soldiers have been killed in Gaza, but he personally is not in combat. In between missions, he hangs out with the other soldiers and reads books. ""There's a lot of waiting time in the war,"" he says. During his two-week stint in Gaza, Keren says he didn't see any Palestinians. ""Not one,"" he says. Israel has ordered Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza, where Keren's unit has been based. Some Palestinians have stayed, but Keren and his fellow soldiers have been sleeping in Palestinian homes whose residents have fled. For the first week, his unit stayed in an abandoned home, with the Palestinian owner's belongings grouped into one room and the soldiers in sleeping bags on the floor in another room. Keren slept with earplugs because of the persistence of the bombings and the growl of tank engines. The windows had been blown out and he slept covered in a net because of the flies that swarmed his feet in the mornings. The second week, they took over a home near the Mediterranean Sea with a swimming pool; he's unsure if Palestinians had been living there because the home was new and empty of belongings when he arrived. One of the soldiers in his unit brought a camera to Gaza, and took a photo of Keren and four soldiers on the floor of that structure, sitting on sleeping mats below some graffiti the soldiers scrawled on the wall: a random drawing of a panda, people's names in Hebrew. ""You make the place . . . as comfortable as you can,"" he says about the doodles on the wall. Keren says he doesn't feel afraid; having his friends from the unit with him in the house and developing a daily routine helps him forget the danger of being a soldier in Gaza. ""The days for me are pretty simple,"" he says. ""It's like a routine for me. We wake up, we drink the coffee, you can see the beach, and it's nice. ""Another photo shows a group of soldiers in Keren's unit hanging out on the Mediterranean shore at sunset, in a part of northern Gaza where the Israeli military has gained complete control. ""That area . . . is very safe. So you don't feel, there, the war. You feel that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] — this is [its] place. So it's not, it's not Gaza anymore,"" he says. Other images photographed by soldiers in Gaza and the West Bank in recent weeks have caused controversies and sparked reprimands from Israeli officials, like images of scores of Palestinian suspects stripped to their underwear and blindfolded, and a video of a soldier singing a Hanukkah song into a mosque's microphone. Gaza is no longer what it was before the war. The destruction is vast; the deaths are catastrophic. The vast majority of Palestinians have been displaced from their homes at Israel's urging to flee combat. They scrounge for flour to bake bread; they sleep in stores, schools, hospitals, tents and cars. Keren's girlfriend, Noam Segal, 20, sitting with Keren in his backyard, says she is angered by social media posts she sees from people around the world who are outraged at Israel's destruction and killings. ""They're making us [into] something that we are not,"" says Segal, who has also served in the military reserves during the war, training soldiers. ""Our war, it's not against the people who live there. We are fighting against the terror organization that tries to kill us. ""She reflects on Palestinian civilians enduring the war in Gaza. ""I'm sorry for people [who are] not part of [the fighting] and just live there and need to suffer this,"" she says. ""But I'm also — I need to think first of my people. ""She and Keren know three Israelis around their age who were taken captive by Hamas on Oct. 7. One of them is Keren's neighbor a few houses away; their moms are friends. When Keren was in Gaza, he thought about the hundreds of Israelis being held captive, perhaps somewhere very close to where he was stationed. ""It feels very weird,"" Keren says. Two of Keren's friends have since been released from captivity and freed from Gaza, in exchange for Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners and detainees. His neighbor down the street is still being held hostage. And now, after his quick furlough, Keren is back in uniform in Gaza. He's one young soldier, motivated by his military mission. He admits he doesn't have a real sense of the bigger picture of where the war is going. ""You can't understand the big picture,"" he says. ""For me, it feels right to be, to take part. It's not fun for us. It's not fun for no one. But we have to do it . . . to protect our civilians and to make sure they can live in their cities safe.

125,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/27/1221761431/gaza-israel-ceasefire-palestinians-war,"TEL AVIV, Israel — A revised Egyptian proposal to end the fighting in Gaza calls for an extended humanitarian cease-fire, and leaves open the question of the shape of future Palestinian governance of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The new draft is the latest version of a plan floated earlier this week. It was obtained by NPR from a Palestinian official and confirmed by an Egyptian source close to the cease-fire negotiations. It aims to chart a path to the end of hostilities: getting more aid into Gaza, exchanging more Israeli hostages held in Gaza for Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails, and bringing to a close Israel's devastating air-and-ground campaign in Gaza. Since Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel that Israeli officials say killed more than 1,200 people and resulted in 240 being seized as hostages, the Israeli military has killed more than 21,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry. An Israeli official said that Israel's war cabinet discussed the initial Egyptian proposal late Monday, after it had been publicly reported on by several news organizations, adding to the public pressure Israel faces to wind down the current phase of the war due to the high civilian death toll and humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza. Egyptian officials gave Palestinian leaders in the West Bank the revised version of the proposal late Tuesday, and Palestinian leaders were set to meet in Egypt in the coming days to discuss it further, a Palestinian official said. Hamas and Islamic Jihad support the outlines of the proposal, the Egyptian source close to the talks said. The proposal could provide a road map pointing a way forward, but a final deal is likely to be far away. In the first stage, lasting 10 days, there would be a complete cessation of hostilities by both Israel and Hamas. Hamas would release all civilians in its possession and Israel would release a mutually agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces would withdraw from residential areas in Gaza and allow freedom of movement for citizens from south to north, as well as the movement of vehicles and trucks. It would also allow freedom of entry for humanitarian aid, including medicines, medical supplies, fuel and food to all areas of Gaza. In a 7-day stage to follow, Hamas would release all Israeli female conscripts it holds in exchange for more Palestinian detainees and prisoners. The deal would also involve the transfer of all bodies held by both sides since the start of operations. A final stage envisions ""negotiations lasting for up to one month regarding the release of all Israeli (male) conscripts held by Hamas in exchange for an agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons. "" Israeli forces would redeploy outside Gaza's borders, according to the proposal, with the continued cessation of all aerial activities, and Hamas would commit to a complete cessation of all military activities against Israel. It is unclear if Israel is willing to negotiate based on this proposal. Previous negotiations have been led by Qatar, which helped broker a week-long cease-fire in late November that led to the exchange of 105 hostages held by Hamas for some 240 Palestinians in Israeli jails. The original Egyptian plan reported on earlier this week called for a new governing body of Palestinians to oversee both the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. It would direct the postwar reconstruction of Gaza and provide for possible future elections to create a national unity government. That part of the plan has been dropped from the latest two-page version of the proposal, but the future Palestinian leadership was expected to be discussed in talks with Egypt and is expected to be a crucial part of any agreement. Hamas in a statement did not reject the latest proposal outright, saying it ""has received initiatives and proposals from several countries"" for a permanent truce. ""Our people do not await temporary truces that the occupation violates with further massacres and heinous war crimes against civilians and the innocent,"" the Islamist militant group said. The Palestinian Authority leadership in the West Bank welcomed the latest Egyptian cease-fire proposal. In remarks Wednesday, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh said any proposal for the future leadership in the West Bank and Gaza Strip must not circumvent the internationally recognized Palestine Liberation Organization, or PLO. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the current Palestinian leadership has failed to condemn the Oct. 7 attacks and is unfit to govern Gaza. Israel offered no immediate public response to the revised plan. The latest diplomatic efforts came as Gaza was recovering from yet another communications blackout. Although cell phone and internet service is being gradually restored, it had been out for an extended period, according to the primary provider there. On Tuesday night, the telecommunications company PalTel announced that damaged infrastructure had resulted in service interruption. Humanitarian agencies and first responders say that without internet or cell phone service, aide workers aren't able to distribute aid. Telecommunications is just one obstacle that the United Nations says is making it increasingly difficult to provide aid to Gaza's 2. 3 million people, more than 85% of whom have become internally displaced since the start of the war. Intensified fighting, blocked roads and lack of fuel also have contributed to the worsening humanitarian crisis.  Speaking to NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday, Juliette Touma, a spokesperson for UNRWA, the U. N. relief agency focused on the Palestinian situation in Gaza, said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was becoming more dire by the moment. ""The needs on the ground are huge,"" she said. ""People [have] lost everything, and they need everything. """"Now, with the rainy season, it's everything from warm clothes to blankets. But most urgently is food and water and I think above all is protection and safety,"" Touma said.

126,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/12/26/1221414237/gaza-infectious-disease-outbreak-public-health-israel-palestine,"In Gaza, the World Health Organization warns that illness may ultimately kill more people than Israel's offensive. Infectious diseases are ""soaring,"" says the WHO. Over 100,000 cases of diarrhea have been reported, with rates among children 25 times higher than before the war. War has shattered Gaza's health-care system, including its disease surveillance capabilities. So global health groups and health professionals are doing what they can to spot and prevent outbreaks in an increasingly desperate situation. ""It's our way of detecting the emergence of diseases that can result in an epidemic very, very, very quickly,"" says Rick Brennan, the WHO's Regional Emergency Director for the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Before the war, despite the Israeli blockade, humanitarian groups say Gaza's public health system was doing a pretty good job. The 2 million-plus Palestinians living there had solid vaccination rates, access to three dozen hospitals and effective disease surveillance. ""There was a reasonably good system to detect disease outbreaks,"" says Brennan, ""to pick up cases of infectious diseases, to transfer the specimens to test them in the laboratories, and then implement control measures. ""But since the October 7 Hamas attack, that system — along with the rest of Gaza's health infrastructure — has crumbled amidst Israel's bombardment and ground offensive. Israel has accused Hamas of harboring weapons and fighters in and around hospitals, including in tunnels underneath them, which has put the facilities in the line of fire. WHO says only a quarter of Gaza's hospitals remain partially functional. Dr. Tahrir Al-Sheikh, a pediatrician in Gaza, has seen that disintegration firsthand. She was working at Al-Nasr Children's Hospital until the war displaced her to the south where she's been offering medical help at a school-turned-shelter. ""We used to culture bacteria in Gaza,"" she says, and ""prescribe medication based on the results. Now, we can't do cultures or anything, and the infections are spreading. ""Al-Sheikh has seen brutal cases of diarrhea. ""I treated a 4-month-old baby who had 20 bowel movements in a day,"" she recalls. She's also witnessed a torrent of respiratory illnesses. ""I've had cases that didn't respond to any treatment,"" she says. ""But I can't tell [the shelter whether] they have COVID, and I can't diagnose it because I don't have the equipment. ""The brew of conditions inside Gaza right now is accelerating the spread of disease. ""Wherever there's overcrowding,"" explains Marwan Al-Homs, director of the Mohammed Yousef El-Najar Hospital in Rafah, ""these epidemics exist — inside shelters, even in tiny apartments where the number of inhabitants is 35 people. ""Juliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, visited the Khan Younis Training Center in south Gaza, a shelter intended for 1,000 people but now hosting more than 30,000. ""You have 400 people sharing one toilet,"" she says. The same goes for showers. ""There's not much water to begin with, whether to wash or to stay clean. There's not much hygiene supplies. ""Across Gaza, people's immune systems are compromised. There's also the colder winter weather to contend with, hospitals in tatters, and a lack of clean water, sanitation, and proper nutrition — services that are difficult to secure under Israel's near total siege of Gaza. ""It's a cauldron of possibility of infectious disease,"" says Amber Alayyan, deputy program manager for Doctors Without Borders in the Palestinian territories. ""If you have no access to antibiotics because you can't get to the doctor,"" she says, ""then something that's so simple to treat can turn into something quite deadly. This really just is an infectious disaster in waiting. ""Global health groups are racing to ramp up disease surveillance efforts in Gaza before there is widespread illness, which the WHO says could endanger even more lives than the combat. Last weekend, Ayadil Saparbekov, WHO team lead for health emergencies in the Palestinian territories, traveled from Jerusalem to Gaza to ferry rapid diagnostics for hepatitis and cholera into the enclave. ""I am bringing the testing kits to timely detect and to respond to different infectious disease outbreaks,"" he said in a video posted on X, the site previously known as Twitter. UNRWA's Touma underscores the importance of regular and sustained humanitarian aid, including hygiene supplies, vaccines and chlorine tablets. ""All those things are absolutely critical in disease prevention,"" she says. WHO is hoping to resuscitate one or two of the local laboratories in Gaza that did pathogen screening before the war, though that will take effort and time. In addition, they hope ""to even bring a mobile laboratory from outside,"" says Brennan. ""And we're also looking at options for bringing specimens outside the country, particularly to Egypt, for testing. That's proven a little bit more challenging than we'd expected. ""While the logistics of those approaches are negotiated, Brennan says he's relieved that some of the really terrible diseases — like measles or cholera — haven't surfaced yet in Gaza. That's due in part due to pre-war vaccinations. ""If we get an influenza outbreak into those massively overcrowded shelters,"" says Brennan, ""if we've got shigella dysentery, that could rip through a community very quickly and really impact the most vulnerable. To be honest, I'm grateful that we've got to this point. We've got increased rates but we haven't had a deadly outbreak yet. ""Whether that good fortune lasts may depend on disease surveillance to identify the first handful of cases of something sinister — ideally, while it can still be contained.",npr_articles/article_126.txt,npr_results/article_126.txt.json
127,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/25/1221526349/israeli-airstrike-syria-kills-iranian-general,"BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike Monday in a Damascus neighborhood killed a high-ranking Iranian general, Iranian state media said. The killing of Seyed Razi Mousavi, a long-time adviser of the Iranian paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in Syria, comes as clashes along the Lebanon-Israel border between Hezbollah and Israel continue to intensify with fears of the Israel-Hamas war sparking a regional spillover with Iran-backed groups. The Israeli strikes killed two other generals earlier this month in Syria. Israel struck the Sayida Zeinab neighborhood, located near a Shiite Muslim shrine, Iran's official news agency IRNA and Britain-based opposition war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. IRNA described Mousavi as a close companion of Gen. Qassim Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force who was slain in a U. S. drone strike in Iraq in January 2020. Neither the Israeli military nor Syrian state media immediately issued a statement about the attack. Though IRNA didn't provide other details about the attack, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Israeli military targeted Mousavi after he entered a farm in the area, which allegedly was one of several offices for Hezbollah. The Lebanese militant group, alongside Iran and Russia, has played a key military role in keeping President Bashar Assad's government in power throughout the Syrian conflict. Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on targets inside government-controlled parts of war-torn Syria in recent years. It doesn't usually acknowledge its airstrikes on Syria. But when it does, it says it's targeting Iranian-backed groups there that have backed Assad's government.",npr_articles/article_127.txt,npr_results/article_127.txt.json

The proposal, worked out with Qatar, has been presented to Israel, Hamas, the United States and European governments, the AP reported. No parties have agreed to move forward with the plan just yet, but it comes after one of the deadliest weekends in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike hit a refugee camp in the central part of the strip that killed over 100 Palestinians. According to Israeli and Egyptian news reports, the plan calls for a weeklong cease-fire. Hamas would release about 40 Israeli hostages held in Gaza in exchange for about 120 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Another phase would lead to the exchange of the bodies of Israelis and Palestinians killed during the war. A third phase would lead to a permanent cease-fire and include the exchange of any remaining Israeli hostages for all Palestinian prisoners currently held in Israeli detention. A new governing body of Palestinians would be put in place to oversee the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank. That leadership would oversee the reconstruction of Gaza and possible future elections to create a unified Palestinian government. The plan is the first to be led by Egypt rather than Qatar, which helped broker the first weeklong cease-fire of this war in November. During that pause in fighting 105 Israeli hostages and 240 Palestinian prisoners were released. However, according to Reuters, both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group that participated in the deadly Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people, have rejected the Egyptian plan's call for ceding their power in Gaza. The two groups are open to a pause in fighting, release of hostages in exchange for prisoners, and increasing the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, according to the report. Israeli newspapers reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Israeli troops in Gaza earlier Monday and said in a meeting with members of the Likud political party that the war ""is not close to being over. "" According to the Israeli military, 17 soldiers were killed in Gaza this past weekend, bringing the total number of Israeli soldiers killed in the war to 156. More than 20,400 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. International aid groups say the situation across the strip is dire, with winter temperatures settling in as millions of people take shelter in makeshift camps in the south. Trucks full of water, food and other humanitarian supplies continue to trickle in across in Rafah and Kerem Shalom, but Palestinian officials say it's still not enough.

Associated Press journalists at a nearby hospital watched frantic Palestinians carry the dead, including a baby, and wounded following the strike on the Maghazi refugee camp east of Deir al-Balah. One bloodied young girl looked stunned while her body was checked for broken bones. The 68 fatalities include at least 12 women and seven children, according to early hospital figures. ""We were all targeted,"" said Ahmad Turkomani, who lost several family members including his daughter and grandson. ""There is no safe place in Gaza anyway. ""Earlier, the Health Ministry in Gaza gave the death toll as 70. The Israeli military had no immediate comment. As Christmas Eve fell, smoke rose over the besieged territory, while in the West Bank Bethlehem was hushed, its holiday celebrations called off. In neighboring Egypt, tentative efforts continued on a deal for another exchange of hostages for Palestinians held by Israel. The war has devastated parts of Gaza, killed roughly 20,400 Palestinians and displaced almost all of the territory's 2. 3 million people. The mounting death toll among Israeli troops — 156 since the ground offensive began — could erode public support for the war, which was sparked when Hamas-led militants stormed communities in southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 and taking 240 hostage. Israelis still largely stand behind the country's stated goals of crushing Hamas' governing and military capabilities and releasing the remaining 129 captives. That's despite rising international pressure against Israel's offensive, and the soaring death toll and unprecedented suffering among Palestinians. ""The war exacts a very heavy price from us, but we have no choice but to continue fighting,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. In a nationally televised speech, Israeli President Isaac Herzog appealed for the country to remain united. ""This moment is a test. We will not break nor blink,"" he said. There has been widespread anger against his government, which many criticize for failing to protect civilians on Oct. 7 and promoting policies that allowed Hamas to gain strength over the years. Netanyahu has avoided accepting responsibility for the military and policy failures. ""Over time, the public will find it hard to ignore the heavy price paid, as well as the suspicion that the aims that were loudly heralded are still far from being attained, and that Hamas is showing no signs of capitulating in the near future,"" wrote Amos Harel, military affairs commentator for the Haaretz newspaper. The Israeli military said it had completed the dismantling of Hamas' underground headquarters in northern Gaza, part of an operation to take down the vast tunnel network and kill off top commanders that Israeli leaders have said could take months. Efforts toward negotiations continued. The head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Ziyad al-Nakhalah, arrived in Egypt for talks. The militant group, which also took part in the Oct. 7 attack, said it was prepared to consider releasing hostages only after fighting ends. Hamas' top leader Ismail Haniyeh traveled to Cairo for talks days earlier. Israel's offensive has been one of the most devastating military campaigns in recent history. More than two-thirds of the 20,000 Palestinians killed have been women and children, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. On Friday, Israeli airstrikes on two homes in Gaza killed 90 Palestinians, including dozens from an extended family, according to rescuers and hospital officials. One of the homes, located in Gaza City, became one of the deadliest airstrikes in the war after 76 people from the al-Mughrabi family were killed, said Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza's Civil Defense department. The Palestinian Red Crescent said a 13-year-old boy was shot and killed in an Israeli drone attack while inside al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis, a part of Gaza where Israel's military believes Hamas leaders are hiding. An Israeli strike overnight hit a house in a refugee camp west of the city of Rafah, on Gaza's border with Egypt. At least two men were killed, according to Associated Press journalists in the hospital where the bodies were taken. At least two people were killed and six others wounded when a missile stuck a building in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. And Palestinians reported heavy Israeli bombardment and gunfire in Jabaliya, an area north of Gaza City that Israel had claimed to control. Hamas' military arm said its fighters shelled Israeli troops in Jabaliya and Jabaliya refugee camp. Israel faces international criticism for the civilian death toll but it blames Hamas, citing the militants' use of crowded residential areas and tunnels. Israel has launched thousands of airstrikes since Oct. 7. It says it has killed thousands of Hamas militants, without presenting evidence. Israel also faces allegations of mistreating Palestinian men and teenage boys detained in homes, shelters, hospitals and elsewhere during the offensive. It has denied abuse allegations and said those without links to militants are quickly released. Speaking to the AP from a hospital bed in Rafah after his release, Khamis al-Burdainy of Gaza City said Israeli forces detained him after tanks and bulldozers partly destroyed his home. He said men were handcuffed and blindfolded. ""We didn't sleep. We didn't get food and water,"" he said, crying and covering his face. Another released detainee, Mohammed Salem, from the Gaza City neighborhood of Shijaiyah, said Israeli troops beat them. ""We were humiliated,"" he said.

""The 87-year-old leader's address began with, ""A census of the whole Earth,"" where he drew comparisons between emperors and God. He talked about how the powerful seek to make a name for themselves in history, while ""the King of history chooses the way of littleness,"" which teed up his next point. An emperor's census of the whole Earth, ""Manifests the all-too-human threat that runs through history: the quest for worldly power and might, fame and glory,"" Francis said.

131,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/24/1221124833/israel-gaza-kibbutz-hamas-palestinians-farms,"NIR OZ, Israel — At a dairy farm a few miles from the Gaza border, hundreds of cows are being herded into milking stations as the sound of Israeli airstrikes reverberate through the morning air. Since Hamas fighters swept through this area on Oct. 7, killing or kidnapping a total of 1,200 people, Israel says, the bombing has become commonplace — even more so since Khan Younis, Gaza's second-largest city located nearly due west of here, has become a focus of the conflict. The cattle aren't spooked by the sounds of war. For the people here, however, the conflict is hard to ignore. Aline Stern, a retired nurse from northern Israel who has been volunteering at the farm for the past few weeks, has learned to identify the implements of modern warfare. Looking up, she points out an Israeli drone flying directly overhead. Later, she notes the distinctive whoosh from a salvo of Hellfire missiles and explains that they are fired from Apache helicopters. Familiar as it all is, ""you never get used to it,"" she says. Stern is one of about a dozen volunteers from Israel and around the world who have been rotating into this farm close to Nir Oz, a communal farm community in Israel known as a kibbutz. She's helping fill the gap left by the workers who are no longer here. Of the 400 residents of Nir Oz, Hebrew for ""courageous meadow,"" about 38 were killed by Hamas and another 75 seized as hostages, according to Israeli media. Along with the nearby Be'eri, it was among the hardest-hit kibbutzim. Some members of these communities have already said they have no intention of coming back. After the October attack, it took Israeli troops five days to regain control of this area. In that time, Stern says, the cows that normally get a daily milking were left unattended. Many developed infections and more than 100 were too far gone by the time the army let anyone return. The animals had to be slaughtered. The surviving cows, she says, ""were very sad, they didn't give milk like they used to. "" Eleven weeks since the start of the war, things on this side of the Gaza border are slowly getting better — although no one can yet imagine anything resembling normalcy. Shmulik Itzhaki is a volunteer from central Israel. His day job in satellite communications is seemingly the polar opposite of dairy farming. He says he's happy to pitch in for as long as he can, but given the horrors the community experienced, he doesn't think the survivors will ever call it home again. ""For the people who lived here, it's a trauma,"" Itzhaki explains. ""Imagine someone who escaped from Auschwitz and you ask him to go live there? It's hard. ""For many here, the decision to help comes from a sense of duty. Gabriel Leff, a 23-year-old from Cocoa Beach, Fla. , certainly sees it that way. Moved to sympathy by the events of Oct. 7, he arrived in Israel two months ago and since then has been volunteering in various places around the country. He's a fairly new arrival at the dairy farm. Leff wears a kippah, the traditional Jewish head covering, and sports faded blue jeans, a sleeveless t-shirt and the tall work boots required for traipsing through cow manure. ""I'm young. I have the free time. I'm able bodied. And I felt interested in doing my part,"" he says. Leff sees Israel as a safe haven for Jews living in a troubled world. ""Everywhere we seem to call home, at some point in time, we've been uprooted from,"" he says. ""When antisemitism rises, as it is currently, we always have somewhere to go. For the past 75 years, that's been Israel. ""As the cows are herded in for milking, Nathaniel Willemse, 21, confidently taps their hind legs, coaxing each animal into position above milking stations. He is a law student from the Netherlands. He once worked on a dairy farm, so the work here is old hat for him. Unlike Leff, Willemse isn't Jewish. He just saw a need and decided to spend a few weeks in Israel before starting a new job back home. ""I heard of the terrible things that happened. I just wanted to help a little bit,"" he says. Not far from the dairy farm, an all-too-close Israeli howitzer intermittently lobs artillery into Gaza. A sandy road splits neat rows of avocado and orange trees, pregnant with ripe fruit. Paul Flynn came to Israel from Ireland four decades ago and still retains his native brogue. He's a supervisor at the orchards that are collectively operated by seven villages of Israelis who were relocated from inside of Gaza in 2005, when Israel disengaged from the Palestinian territory to allow for self-government there. Flynn says a large swath of the fields have now been declared off limits by the army. They're simply too close to Gaza. Before the war, he oversaw about 40 laborers from Thailand. The day Hamas attacked was a Saturday and Flynn was at home. The Thai farm hands, however, were working. As Hamas fighters overran the area, the workers made a panicked retreat to a safe room on the farm grounds. They spent the next day there before an Israeli tank arrived and was able to chase off the militants. It was a harrowing experience, and afterward, all but a handful of the workers opted to fly home aboard a Thai government charter flight. It all means that now there's hardly anyone for Flynn to supervise — or more to the point, to harvest the fruit before it rots. ""Some of the avocados we can pick in another month or two,"" he says. ""But some of them that we should have picked two months ago, we'll have to give up on them. ""Now Flynn is relying mostly on retired Israeli volunteers who arrive by bus. He's grateful, even if the helpers aren't entirely suited to the task. ""A lot of them are . . . more mature, let's say. They can't go climbing ladders and trees. So, they are only picking up to their own height,"" he says. Trees weighed down by unpicked fruit will be less productive next year, Flynn says, and that could mean higher prices in Europe, where most of the crop is exported. Ilana Menache, in her 60s, is one of the volunteers — and she is indeed going for the low-hanging avocados. Burrowing into a thicket of branches, her voice quavers with emotion as she talks about the future. After all that has happened, she says Israel had no choice — it had to try to eradicate Hamas in Gaza, where more than 20,000 people have died since the start of the conflict. Even so, Menache says, Israelis and Palestinians have to find a way to live together in peace.  ""All the sides can learn something from this situation,"" she says. ""It will take time"" to rebuild the confidence and find a solution. ""We have no other choice, you know?""",npr_articles/article_131.txt,npr_results/article_131.txt.json
132,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/23/1220073353/palestinian-olive-harvest-west-bank-israel-hamas-war,"BEITUNIA, West Bank — This time of year, Palestinian olive farmers are usually hard at work in their groves. But during this harvest season, 35-year-old West Bank farmer Thaer el Taher can only look out on his hillside olive groves from afar. Because of the war in Gaza, he has not been able to access his land. ""You see the fence over there?"" he says, pointing down at a barrier running across the hilly, arid terrain. El Taher has pulled to the side of the rutted road that winds out of his village of Beitunia. ""Do you see the olive trees over there on the hill on the other side of the fence?"" he says. ""All of that is Beitunia's inaccessible lands. ""Inaccessible because the land is on the other side of the barrier separating the West Bank from Israel. Even in normal times, harvest season is fraught for Palestinian farmers living near the barrier. They are only allowed to access their olive trees for a limited number of hours and days. This year, the Israel-Hamas war has meant little to no access at all. Israel built the barrier two decades ago, against the backdrop of a Palestinian uprising and repeated suicide bombings known as the second intifada. In urban areas, the barrier is a 22-foot wall. Out here, it's a barbed wire, electrified fence. The 440-mile circuitous barrier strays into West Bank territory — including most of the land El Taher says he inherited from his grandfather. ""Twenty years ago, when this route of the separation barrier was first revealed, the whole international community was up in arms,"" says Jessica Montell, an Israeli human rights advocate whose organization, HamoKed, or Hotline, works to get Palestinians access to their farmland cut off by the barrier. ""The Israeli government made a lot of promises that this would in no way disrupt people living alongside the route. ""But that's exactly what the barrier has done, she tells NPR in her office in East Jerusalem. It has cut Palestinians off from a little over 9% of their land, she says. Farmers' lives now revolve around a system of permits and access schedules for when Israeli soldiers will open the barrier gates. El Taher explains how, in normal times, Palestinian farmers have to register for the olive harvest. ""You show up early in the morning at the gate,"" he says, ""soldiers check your ID and you're allowed to get to your groves. ""No one passes if their name is not on the list, he says, and families are restricted to a certain number. He remembers going to the same land with his father when he was a boy, before the barrier was built. ""In the morning, we would check on the grapes, we would check on the olives, and in the afternoon, we would go pick the figs,"" he says. ""Life in Beitunia was all focused on agriculture and we were able to go to our lands twice a day. ""Forty-eight-year-old Naser El Khatib, also an olive farmer and a friend of El Taher's, calls farming an instinct inherited from his ancestors. El Khatib says 17,000 square yards of his olive groves are behind the separation barrier and he can never properly attend to them. ""We never have enough time in our groves and we cannot take the tools we need,"" he says. ""If I carry scissors, I'm not allowed to take them. They consider they might be a danger to other people. ""During a typical olive harvest season, the gates are opened and the farmers are able to access their lands for about 40 days, from early in the morning until evening. After the Oct. 7 attack, Palestinians have not been allowed to enter Israel. But, Montell points out, ""These farmers don't want to enter Israel. They want to enter lands inside the West Bank, on the other side of the separation wall. ""HamoKed petitioned Israel's Supreme Court to open the gates for the farmers. Last week, that petition was rejected. The government countered that the restrictions on movement were the result of the ""unusual"" and ""complex"" security situation due to the war. It said the situation is being reviewed daily out of a desire to return to routine. But Montell says it's likely too late for Palestinian farmers. ""There's a small window to finish harvesting these groves,"" she says. ""If they don't get access, they're going to lose a year's worth of income. ""Palestinian olive farmers say they are also facing increased harassment from Israeli settlers this year. El Khatib says the settlers are always there at harvest time. ""Every year they come when we enter to harvest our trees,"" he says. ""We try to avoid them. But the atmosphere becomes very tense. They take pictures of us and are constantly doing things to disrupt and annoy us. ""Roy Yellin, the head of outreach for Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem, says settlers, many of whom are armed by the state, now are exploiting the new climate of fear in Israel to further their own political agenda. There have been reports of violence and intimidation of Palestinian farmers, with settlers even uprooting and burning olive trees. Dia M. Qurt is the mayor of Beitunia. His fourth-floor office looks out on the hillside of off-limits olive groves. He says Israel claims the barrier is to protect Jewish settlements. ""But basically this is about the theft of Palestinian land,"" he says. ""When they ban people from going to their land, they consolidate their presence on these lands. ""Olives and olive byproducts are the largest economic sector in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, says Mohammad Olwan, deputy head of the Palestinian farmers' union. A poster in his Ramallah office reads: ""They uproot one tree, we plant ten. ""But he says it's bigger than the economy. ""Olives and olive trees are a cultural symbol,"" says Olwan. ""They consolidate Palestinian existence on the land, both symbolically and realistically. ""Olwan says between 50% and 90% of farmers' earnings in this area come from olives. At a local olive cooperative, olive press owner Saad Awwad is sitting out in front of the facility on an old bus seat propped against the wall. His press is usually humming away this time of year. But on this day, it sits empty and idle. Olwan says there are simply no olives to press. ""Only those who live far from the separation barrier and the Jewish settlements have been able to pick their olives this year,"" he says. ""Around here, thousands of acres have gone to waste, and many farmers will go bankrupt. """,npr_articles/article_132.txt,npr_results/article_132.txt.json
133,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/23/1219387023/college-campus-student-israel-gaza,"Hannah Levitan, a 21-year-old senior at Tulane University, takes her job as a student reporter very seriously. ""As a journalist you're never off the clock,"" she says. She was leaving an interview the Thursday before Halloween when she heard students were gathering near the school's New Orleans campus in support of Palestinians. ""I walked into that rally and instantly realized this is something that people are going to talk about for months to come, years to come maybe. ""The rally turned heated, and then violent. It marked a turning point both on campus and for the reporters of The Tulane Hullabaloo. Tensions have been high on U. S. college campuses, ever since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, and the resulting war in Gaza. There have been demonstrations, backlash and even violence on campuses from New York City to Cambridge, Mass. , to Ann Arbor, Mich. Even college leaders have come under fire – notably the presidents of Harvard University, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania, who faced withering criticism for their Capitol Hill testimony on antisemitism. For student journalists, like Levitan, what's happening on their campuses is likely the biggest story they've ever covered — and it's tricky to write about when friends and classmates are so deeply divided. Things are especially complicated at Tulane. About a third of students at the private, highly-selective school identify as Jewish, according to the university's Hillel chapter. That includes Levitan, The Hullabaloo's digital director. ""I mean, people literally call it Jewlane,"" she says. The school doesn't track how many students identify as Muslim, or any other religion. There is a Muslim student group, but they did not respond to NPR's requests. Lindsay Ruhl, The Hullabaloo's breaking news editor, says when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 240 hostages, the campus appeared united in its grief. But as the days passed and Israel launched its air and ground campaign in Gaza — that's since killed more than 20,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza — Ruhl says things fractured. ""It was good to see everyone come together,"" she says of the unity following Oct. 7. ""But looking at it now, it's a different issue. ""Levitan says the rally on a sunny day at the end of October started out peaceful. But as counter-protestors gathered, both sides started hurling insults. A video posted to social media — and referenced in Levitan's reporting — shows a red pickup truck pulling into the middle of the street, between the two groups. Someone standing in the bed of the truck holds a lighter up to an Israeli flag and another person runs up and pulls the flag away. For a brief moment, the protest becomes violent. The Tulane University Police Department confirmed the details of what happened at the rally. Three students were assaulted and several people were arrested, none of them students, according to a Tulane spokesperson. The demonstration wasn't the only sign of tension on campus. The night before, a student was arrested for spray-painting the divisive phrase ""from the river to the sea"" on a building near the library. Ruhl, who isn't Jewish, says after those incidents, ""Some of my friends were scared to go to class. And regardless of how they were feeling, their parents were texting them. ""Tulane officials described the rally and the spray-painted message as ""deeply distressing"" and said they would increase security, even though the rally technically happened off-campus. Since then, Tulane has been added to a list of dozens of schools under investigation by the U. S. Department of Education for possible ""discrimination involving shared ancestry. ""The Education Department didn't give details about Tulane's possible violations, but a university spokesperson said in a statement that the rally is at the center of the investigation. Ruhl and Levitan say student opinions on the conflict vary widely. And not everyone at the rally was there for the same reason — even if it seemed like they had picked a side. ""There are people who are standing on the pro-Israel side against Hamas or against antisemitism,"" Levitan says. ""Or they're standing on the pro-Israel side because they support [Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin]  Netanyahu. You don't know that unless you speak with them. ""Which is exactly what she and Ruhl did on both sides of the protest. ""We talked to a guy who was sobbing,"" Ruhl says. ""I almost cried interviewing people on both sides. ""Those emotions came through in the recordings Ruhl and Levitan made of their interviews, and they wanted to do more with the sound they'd captured. ""It became apparent as we were going through them, that these are things that you need to hear because the emotion is something that you cannot read in print,"" Levitan says. So they decided to make the paper's first ever podcast, Breaking Waves. The first episode puts students with different opinions side-by-side, something Levitan says hasn't always been happening at gatherings on campus. Tulane senior Anaya Rodgers attended the rally in support of Palestinians. ""Israel doesn't need support, they have the U. S. support,"" she said in the first episode of Breaking Waves. ""The Palestinian people, people of color, Muslim people, my people, we need the support that we so desperately haven't gotten yet. ""Searching for words, and breath, first year student Gabriel Rudelman told the podcast he feared for family members' safety in Israel. ""It's scary to be a Jew right now . . . We're not safe. If Israel didn't exist, we would all be dead right now. None of us would be standing here right now. ""Levitan and Ruhl say reaction to the podcast and the paper's coverage has been largely positive. But Ruhl says she felt like some of her classmates saw her differently after she covered the pro-Palestinian demonstration. People told her they were hurt when they saw photos of her at the rally. They didn't understand her role as an impartial journalist, charged with writing about both sides. ""It's kind of frustrating,"" Ruhl says. Levitan says social media is making the problem worse. She says college-specific platforms like Fizz can serve as echo chambers, where one-sided misinformation is framed as news, further entrenching students in their views. ""We're 18 to 21, how could you possibly have made up your mind and decided that you are standing on one side and you are unwavering?"" Levitan says. ""You are not going to ever consider speaking to people on that other side?""She says The Hullabaloo and the university have a chance to bring students together to listen and learn from one another. It's an opportunity they can't afford to miss. Edited by: Nicole CohenVisual design and development by: LA Johnson",npr_articles/article_133.txt,npr_results/article_133.txt.json
134,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/22/1220366681/gaza-united-nations-security-council-resolution,"After days of protracted and slow-moving negotiations, the United Nations Security Council has approved a resolution calling for ""urgent steps"" to allow expanded aid into the Gaza strip, as the territory faces a spiraling humanitarian crisis from weeks of Israeli bombardment. But lacking unanimous support for an immediate pause to the fighting, the resolution stopped short of calling for a cease-fire. The final vote on the resolution, which was drafted by the United Arab Emirates, was 13-o. The United States abstained from the vote, as did Russia. Friday's vote had originally been scheduled for Monday, but it was repeatedly delayed to allow for negotiations over the final text of the resolution in an effort to get the U. S. — Israel's strongest ally on the international stage — to agree not to veto. In the end, the wording approved by the Security Council was watered down compared to earlier drafts of the resolution. Previous drafts had called for a ""cessation"" or even a ""suspension"" of hostilities, which the U. S. objected to. Negotiators ultimately settled on language that called for creating ""the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities. """"We know this is not a perfect text. We know only a cease-fire will end this suffering,"" said Ambassador Lana Zaki Nusseibeh of the United Arab Emirates, the sponsor of the resolution, in remarks ahead of the vote. ""Often in diplomacy, the challenge is meeting the moment in the world we live in, not in the world that we want,"" she added. Another sticking point in negotiations was whether the U. N. itself should inspect the trucks that are entering Gaza to deliver desperately needed aid. Israel currently inspects these convoys to make sure there are no weapons being smuggled in for Hamas.  The U. S. has been working to get Israel to accelerate the pace of these inspection, but the Biden administration has been wary of a new U. N. resolution further complicating what is already a complicated situation. ""There are still serious and widespread concerns that this Resolution as drafted could actually slow down delivery of humanitarian aid by directing the U. N. to create an unworkable monitoring mechanism,"" said U. S. spokesperson Nate Evans on Thursday. ""We must ensure any Resolution helps and doesn't hurt the situation on the ground. ""The final language of the resolution does not call for a new inspection regime. Instead, it asks the U. N. secretary general to appoint an aide coordinator for Gaza. Friday's resolution also called for ""the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages"" and urged the provision of enough fuel into Gaza to meet all humanitarian needs, a long-running sticking point for Israel, which says Hamas could steal fuel for its combat effort. Prior to Friday, the U. S. had vetoed Security Council resolutions on Israel and Gaza since the conflict began in October, most recently earlier this month, when American officials said a resolution had been rushed and ignored U. S. diplomatic efforts. The U. S. had also objected to resolutions that did not explicitly condemn Hamas. In Gaza, some 85% of Gaza's population have fled their homes and crowded into shelters and tent camps in the territory's south as Israel has continued to expand its ground operation. Much of northern Gaza has been flattened or damaged by airstrikes, including hospitals, schools, places of worship and thousands of homes. More than half of households in Gaza are experiencing ""severe levels of hunger,"" according to a recent report by the World Food Programme. On average, Palestinians in Gaza have access to less than two liters of drinking water per day, the report found.  A growing number of international voices have expressed concern that the Israeli military is not taking enough steps to limit harm to civilians — including, increasingly, the U. S. , which has sent officials to Israel this week to encourage leaders to dial back the intensity of its Gaza operation. Criticism of Israel's ground operation has redoubled in recent days, even among Israelis, after the Israeli military admitted that its own soldiers had shot and killed three Israeli hostages in Gaza, who were shirtless and waving a makeshift white flag in an effort to be rescued. This week, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin arrived in Israel to urge leaders there to downscale the war effort to more targeted operations that reduce wide-scale harm to civilians. The attacks on Israel by Hamas fighters on Oct. 7 killed 1,200 people and kidnapped hundreds of others, Israel says. Israel's military says more than 130 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive. An estimated 129 people are still being held captive in Gaza, according to the Israeli prime minister's office. At least 20 of them are thought to be dead. More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed since Oct. 7, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not differentiate between combatants and civilians but says the majority of those killed have been women or children.

135,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/22/1221128897/masha-gessen-essay-israel-gaza-germany-hannah-arendt-prize,"Prominent Russian-American journalist Masha Gessen received a prestigious award for political thought over the weekend, in a ceremony that almost didn't happen due to backlash over their recent writings on Israel-Gaza. Israel's air-and-ground assault on Gaza has killed more than 20,000 people in the 10 weeks since the Hamas-led attack on Israel killed some 1,200 people and took more than 240 others hostage. Gessen, who is Jewish and whose family lost loved ones in the Holocaust, has been criticized for a New Yorker essay published earlier this month in which they likened the Gaza Strip to the WWII-era ghettos that Nazis developed to segregate and control Jewish people in occupied Europe. Gessen argues in the essay that treating the Holocaust as a ""singular event,"" unlike anything that has occurred before or after in history, not only is incorrect but makes it impossible to learn lessons from the Holocaust that are needed to prevent future genocides. The term ""would have given us the language to describe what is happening in Gaza now. The ghetto is being liquidated,"" they wrote, referring to the process in which Jews were either killed in ghettos or forced out to concentration camps. Gessen notes there are key differences between the two: The Nazi claim that ghettos were necessary to protect non-Jews from disease ""had no basis in reality,"" while Israel's stance that the isolation of Gaza is necessary to protect against Palestinian terrorist attacks ""stems from actual and repeated acts of violence. "" ""Yet both claims propose that an occupying authority can choose to isolate, immiserate — and now, mortally endanger — an entire population of people in the name of protecting its own,"" they contend. The essay was published — and made waves — just as Gessen was preparing to travel to Bremen, Germany to accept the Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thought. The award, which is funded by the left-leaning Heinrich Böll Foundation and the government of Bremen, honors those who contribute to public thought in the tradition of the influential 20th-century philosopher. Both the foundation and Bremen's town hall quickly withdrew their support from the awards ceremony, which was originally set for last Friday. A scaled-down ceremony was held in a different venue the following day. Shortly after, Gessen spoke to Morning Edition's Leila Fadel about the controversy and the essay that started it. This Q&A with Masha Gessen has excerpts that were not part of the broadcast version. It has been edited and condensed for clarity and length. Leila Fadel: I want to lay out the point and the argument of your piece before we get to the backlash that happened. In your recent essay for The New Yorker, you discuss how ""the politics of memory of the Holocaust and antisemitism obscure what we see in Israel and Gaza today. "" . . . What is the central argument in your piece?Masha Gessen: It's an argument for comparing the Holocaust to present-day situations, and I make this argument both explicitly and implicitly. I believe that to deliver on the promise of ""Never Again,"" we have to constantly be checking to see if we are once again sliding into the darkness, which I believe is something that's happening in Gaza today. The essay looks at how memory culture, particularly in Germany, has sort of ossified and given birth to a vast and rather bizarre bureaucracy that polices what it perceives as antisemitism. But antisemitism is often too often defined as criticism of Israel, rather than actual antisemitic attacks and harassment. LF: I wondered if you saw any similar policing here in the U. S. of the discourse around Israel's policies. MG: I think we're increasingly hearing that anti-Zionism is antisemitism. When Jewish activists and especially Israeli-Jewish activists are speaking out against Israeli policies, to have non-Jewish people brand that as antisemitism is downright bizarre, but also dangerous. I see a very strong current of wielding antisemitism as a cudgel against, among others, Jewish people, in Representative [Elise] Stefanik's campaign against university presidents. One of the presidents that she grilled — the president of MIT — is Jewish. And I also say that the entire premise of this campaign against universities is profoundly antisemitic, which is that universities receive a lot of Jewish money. So Jews, donors, should be mobilized to withdraw their money, which is just such a clear antisemitic trope, and so clearly weaponized by the right wing, which, again, is something that's very similar to what's happened here in Germany. LF: The way criticism of Israeli policy became linked or equated with antisemitism. How did that happen?MG: This has been one of the top priorities of the consecutive Netanyahu governments. Netanyahu has forged alliances, particularly with right-wing governments of European countries, such as Hungary and Poland, in order to prevent an anti occupation consensus in the European Union. It's been a very successful, very concerted yearslong campaign on the part of Israel. And one of the vehicles for this equation is the International Holocaust Remembrance Association definition of antisemitism, which effectively equates anti-Zionism or criticism of Israel with antisemitism. And this definition has been adopted by all European countries, and the U. S. State Department. LF: This comparison isn't something that's really done. And you also make a comparison that caused backlash, saying Gaza right now is like a Nazi era Jewish ghetto and that right now the ghetto is being liquidated. But you must have known writing it would get this type of backlash. Why did you make that comparison? MG: Well, the comparison is very much the centerpiece of the article. And I think that we have a moral and one could also argue, legal obligation to compare the Holocaust and the atrocities committed during the Second World War to the present. If we take the promise of never again, seriously, we once again have to constantly be asking ourselves, are we laying the foundations for the mass murder of millions of people? Are we employing or as part of the world employing the same kinds of tactics that were employed by the Nazis? I think there's every reason to say that that is exactly what's happening. Human Rights Watch issued a report stating unequivocally that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war, which not only is a war crime, but it is a war crime that was committed by the Nazis. I think we're seeing the exact same thing happening in Gaza. Now with nine out of 10 Gazans internally displaced, with half of Gaza's hospitals destroyed, and the remaining hospitals providing only partial services, with the majority of the population of Gaza, suffering from starvation: we can say that it really resembles the situation not only of ghettos, but of the liquidation of ghettos in Nazi occupied Europe. And this is the moment for the world to say if we're going to make good on the promise of ""Never Again,"" we have to step in now. LF: Right now there is a very real rise in antisemitism in Europe, in the United States . . . Are antisemites capitalizing on the criticisms you raise about the way Israel is conducting its war against Hamas in Gaza?MG: You know, the honest answer is we don't know. And no one else knows because the way that antisemitism is currently defined in European bureaucracies conflates criticism of Israel with actual antisemitism. If you look, for example, at the statistics on the drastic rise of antisemitism in Germany since the October 7th attacks, you can't tell whether this rise is real or not. Maybe it's real. And that is very dangerous. Maybe it's not real. So this conflation is super dangerous. In fact, I would argue that the conflation of Jews with Israel is antisemitic per se. LF: I know we're focused on this particular backlash and what happened with this Hannah Arendt Prize. But [what about] the general reception of your piece? I mean, what have you heard from readers . . . who are directly impacted or indirectly impacted by what's going on in a way that others are not? MG: We all live in our bubbles . . . Probably the most meaningful thing to me is that I've heard from one survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto and one child of a survivor of Dr. [Josef] Mengele's experiments on twins, both of whom wrote with deep engagement about the comparison of Gaza to the ghetto, which they both agree with. Now, that's not a huge sample. On the other hand, there aren't a lot of survivors in 2023. And in any case, these are very meaningful exchanges that certainly make me think that that the comparison is necessary. And the thing is that if we are so morally willful that the worst can still be stopped in Gaza, and this comparison to the liquidation of the ghetto can be proven wrong, that would be the best possible outcome of comparing Gaza to a Jewish ghetto.

136,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/22/1220211690/gaza-death-toll-20000-killed-israel,"RAMALLAH, West Bank — Israel's devastating air-and-ground assault on Gaza has now killed more than 20,000 people in the 10 weeks since the conflict began, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health — a figure that is fast approaching 1% of the Palestinian territory's pre-war population. The ministry, in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, said Friday that at least 20,057 people have died from the Israeli attacks since Oct. 7. It has said 70% of those killed are women and children. Although the health ministry doesn't differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths, it says the majority of those killed have been women and children. Another 50,000 people in Gaza have been wounded, the  Hamas-controlled ministry says. International aid groups generally agree with its tallies. A death toll of 20,000 in the enclave, where the population is estimated at roughly 2. 1 million, means around 1 out of every 105 people has been killed since the war began. As the death toll continues to rise, Israel faces growing international pressure to end the bombing of Gaza. Even the Biden administration, which has firmly backed Israel's stated goal of crushing Hamas, has repeatedly admonished Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to minimize civilian casualties. Among those whose lives have been shattered by Israel's bombardment is Yousef Es-Sakani. He sits on the edge of a planter under a tree in the center of Ramallah, a bustling, traffic-choked city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and tries to make sense of Israeli airstrikes earlier this month in Gaza that suddenly added most of his family to the war's staggering death toll. In the early morning hours of Dec. 9, he says, his wife, four daughters and two of his sons were killed by Israeli airstrikes that flattened their four-story Gaza City apartment building. A third son only survived because he stayed with an aunt the night of the attack. ""One of the ones killed is my daughter, she had one semester left to graduate to become a doctor,"" he says. Of his two sons killed, the body of one remains buried under the rubble, says Es-Sakani, who wears a black baseball cap, a salt-and-pepper beard and an expression of weary stoicism. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza in response to the Oct. 7 attack, when Hamas staged a lightning strike on southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, Israel says. The Islamist militant group also seized around 240 hostages, but freed more than a hundred of them during a week-long cease-fire at the end of November. At least 110 others remain in captivity, Israeli officials say. At last count, Israel's military says it has killed 7,000 Hamas fighters. It remains unclear, however, whether that figure includes an estimated 1,000 militants Israel says were killed inside its border during the Oct. 7 attack.  People who have followed past wars in Gaza say the Gaza Ministry of Health's numbers are reliable. The ministry has traditionally used a digitized system to gather the names, ages and gender of the dead from hospitals and morgues. Even so, it has become increasingly difficult to keep an accurate count amid frequent communications blackouts in Gaza and attacks on hospitals, which Israeli says are harboring Hamas fighters and command posts. With much of Gaza now reduced to rubble, thousands, like Es-Sakani's son, lie uncounted under tons of concrete and twisted rebar. ""Any numbers you hear are unfortunately an undercount because we don't know how many bodies are underneath the rubble,"" says Sari Bashi, who works in Ramallah and serves as the program director for Human Rights Watch in charge of global research. ""And the [Gaza] civil Defense Force does not have equipment and many areas are unreachable. ""The U. S. wants Israel to shift to lower intensity combat, sending in special forces teams to root out Hamas rather than targeting the Islamist militant group with airplanes and tanks. Many Israelis have also pushed their government toward another cease-fire to secure the release of the remaining hostages. But a retired Israeli brigadier general, Shlomo Brom, said it is difficult for troops to avoid civilian casualties when Hamas is embedded in mosques, schools and hospitals, as the Israelis claim. Brom also says Hamas believes the growing death toll in Gaza is undermining support for Israel's war effort. ""Not only they don't care about their populations, they're seeing the casualties contribute to their cause,"" he said. ""Because that's OK if they can mobilize the media [and] public opinion. ""Meanwhile, for weeks, international aid groups have been warning of a growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with food, water and fuel and critical levels. The U. N. World Food Program, warned Monday that ""Gazans are becoming more desperate by the day, with nowhere to go and nothing to eat.

137,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/21/1220929207/gaza-palestinians-israel-war-united-nations,"This week, experts expect to mark a milestone in Gaza — 20,000 people dead from Israel's offensive, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. That translates to about 1 out of every 115 people in Gaza killed. Neighborhoods have been flattened, hospitals and shelters are inundated and overwhelmed, and families have been decimated. With signs of a potential truce for a hostage exchange between Israel and Hamas, human rights groups are expressing how dire the circumstances have become for people still in Gaza. Philippe Lazzarini is the commissioner-general for UNRWA — the United Nations relief agency that aids Palestinians — and he spoke to All Things Considered host Mary Louise Kelly on Wednesday to share more about the situation in Gaza. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. Mary Louise Kelly: So I know that you're just back from Gaza. You were there last week. This was your third visit since war began. And I saw where you said that every time you go back, you think it cannot get worse. I gather it gets worse. Philippe Lazzarini: Each time it's getting worse. Each time it's getting more desperate. Last time I went was on the eve of the truce. At that time, I have seen how desperate people were in the United Nations shelter. They were overcrowded. They were living in unsanitary condition, sleeping on the floor without mattresses, without blankets. Winter is coming. And when I went last week, I thought that what I saw before was already heartbreaking enough. But an offensive has been expanded now in the south of Gaza Strip, pushing additional hundreds of thousands of people to the south in Rafah. And we have today more than 1. 2 million people across the Gaza Strip sheltered in our premises. These are not even shelters. These are schools. These are warehouses. These are health centers. But you have also hundreds of thousand of people now just living in the open. Kelly: So the shelter is already overflowing and thousands and thousands of people living outside the shelter. Is there one story, one person who you spoke to that'll stay with you?Lazzarini: Well, the story is the story of the man who is a father of children who basically started to burst into tears when he told me that he feels that his dignity has been stripped because he cannot take care of his children anymore, since they are begging every day for a sip of water, for a loaf of bread. They are queuing hours to go to toilets, and basically they feel treated like a human animals. Listen to All Things Considered each day here or on your local member station for more interviews like this. Kelly: Talk to me about food. I understand it's become so scarce that people are scrambling for it, fighting for it if they see a food truck go past. Lazzarini: Oh, this is also something completely new, and I warned more than once that very soon people will not just die because of the bombardment, but they will die because of a combination of weakened immunity, disease outbreak and hunger. And now most of the people I was encountering during my visit were telling me, ""Listen, I haven't eaten for the last day or two days. Sometimes we have to skip for three days. ""So in an environment like this, indeed, people are so desperate that they try to jump on our truck and take the food from the truck and just eat it from the street. Kelly: Where do your efforts stand to get more food in, to get more medicine in, any aid into Gaza?Lazzarini: Our goal is very clear. We need the full opening of the Kerem Shalom crossing in Israel. Two days ago, it reopened. Few trucks came in. But unfortunately, it's not yet at scale to respond to such a massive humanitarian crisis. Kelly: I interviewed the president of Israel, Isaac Herzog, yesterday and I asked him about aid. He was very critical of the U. N. He essentially blamed the U. N. for the bottleneck in getting aid into Gaza. He says the U. N. could be getting more aid in if you wanted. How do you respond to that?Lazzarini: Well, that's true. We could have much, much more if Israel would allow more trucks to come in. Today, for example, we had only 46 truck coming from Kerem Shalom and a hundred trucks coming from Rafah. So basically, despite the reopening of the crossing, we do not have overall additional trucks coming into the Gaza Strip. What we need is something much more meaningful because what we are getting today is far from enough to respond to such a crisis. Kelly: I just want to stay on for this for a minute because it's obviously incredibly frustrating to hear Israel is blaming the U. N. I just heard you say, you know, if Israel would open the crossings and keep them open, we could get more in. How do you break the impasse?Lazzarini: Listen, you have many bottlenecks. First of all, you have still ongoing bombardment — roads which have been destroyed, trucks which have been destroyed. When trucks come in, they are not allowed to go to the final destination. They have to download and then you have to re-offload. If we would let trucks go into the final destination, you can let trucks come in in the hundreds, and this would not be a problem. So the bottleneck is a series of issues related to the conflict but also to administrative procedure. Kelly: Before I let you go, I want to ask about your team, your staff, because I read that it's 135 UNWRA staff have been killed in Gaza since the war began. How many do you still have there and how are they doing?Lazzarini: So indeed, we have 135 people who have been killed since the beginning of the war. This has been devastating for the agency. Today, we still have between 3000 to 5000 staff working on a daily basis. But we should never forget, they are living the same condition than anyone else they are supporting. They are also struggling to find a shelter, they are struggling to find water, electricity and food. And many of the staff are, in fact, coming to work with their children, because basically what they say is, ""I want to be sure that either I see my child at the end of the day, or if we have to die, we will die together.

138,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/21/1217758546/hamas-support-palestinians-west-bank,"RAMALLAH, West Bank — More than two months into Israel's war against Hamas, the militant group's popularity appears to be rising dramatically among Palestinians in the West Bank. ""Hamas made the most important action against Israel since its existence,"" says Nihad Abughosh, a Palestinian journalist and political analyst, who describes himself as a secular moderate. ""To me it's something like a miracle, the 7th of October,"" he tells NPR in an interview in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that Israeli officials say killed more than 1,200 people is viewed in Israel and much of the West as an act of terrorism, that included the killing of women and children. The United States has long designated Hamas a terrorist organization. But many Palestinians view Oct. 7 very differently — as a legitimate act of defiance. During more than two weeks of interviews in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, dozens of people told NPR they don't accept evidence that Hamas targeted and killed civilians. Fadi Quran, a West Bank activist and organizer who works for the progressive advocacy group Avaaz, says he is personally troubled by accounts of Hamas violence against women and children. But he says many Palestinians refuse to believe those stories. ""Palestinians do not support the harming of innocents,"" Quran says. ""From the first day, there was a question on many Palestinians' minds: Is this all true?""Quran says he supports a peaceful resolution to the war. But he believes many Palestinians now see Hamas as a symbol of strength and defiance against Israel's occupation. ""This idea that Gaza, after 17 years of blockade, was capable of challenging the blockade, challenging the military occupation, was seen as an inspiring act of resistance,"" he says. Surveys conducted since Oct. 7 appear to reflect the surge of support for Hamas in the West Bank. ""Three months ago . . . we had 12% support for Hamas in the West Bank, and today it is 44%, so that's more than tripled,"" says Khalil Shikaki, director of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Research. Public support for Hamas in the Gaza Strip also rose modestly during the same period, from 38% to 42%, according to the center's survey conducted from Nov. 22-Dec. 2. The survey, published Dec. 13, found less than half of Palestinians support Hamas as an organization, but respondents showed ""wide public support for Hamas' offensive"" against Israel. A previous poll conducted by the group Arab World for Research and Development in late October and early November found 68% of Palestinians in the West Bank supported Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. People in the West Bank say there's another reason Hamas' brand has surged in popularity. In November, Israel agreed to release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, many of them held without criminal charges, in exchange for Hamas freeing some of the hostages taken during the Oct. 7 attack. To many Palestinians, that deal represented another victory for Hamas, another sign of strength. ""Hamas is going in the right direction,"" says Hanan Barghouti, 59, who was arrested by Israel in September for allegedly aiding Hamas. She was released from jail last month as part of the hostage-for-prisoner exchange and believes if not for Hamas' pressure, she would not have been freed. Barghouti told NPR she is heartened by the surge in popularity for Hamas in the West Bank. ""Any person under occupation has the right to fight,"" she says, during an interview in her home in Ramallah. ""Hamas' reputation has grown, not only locally but even on the international level. ""Drinking coffee in her living room, with her grandchildren playing nearby, Barghouti says there's one more key reason Hamas has gained support. Many Palestinians now share the long-standing conviction of Hamas and its leadership that the time for peace talks and a negotiated settlement with Israel has ended, she says. ""Palestine is for Palestinians,"" she says. ""This is our house, our land. ""Indeed this view — that Palestinians cannot co-exist with the state of Israel — was voiced to NPR again and again in the West Bank by shopkeepers, laborers, taxi drivers, farmers and government officials. They told NPR that years of negotiations between Palestinians, Israeli leaders and diplomats from the U. S. and other countries toward a two-state solution have brought Palestinians nothing — no independence and no relief from Israeli occupation. Pollster Shikaki says this belief is reflected in surveys of Palestinians, a majority of whom now believe ""if they want to become independent and free of Israeli occupation, they must resort to armed struggle. """"And when they look around at who can deliver armed struggle, they look at what Hamas had done on Oct. 7,"" Shikaki says. Even many moderates say the time has come for Hamas' militant, armed approach to resistance and confrontation with Israel. They also say the more moderate Palestinian Authority — the official government of the West Bank, which still supports a negotiated ""political"" settlement with Israel — has seen its popular support collapse in recent years, in part because of what many Palestinians view as collaboration with Israeli security officials. ""The bad performance of the [Palestinian] Authority here, this gives power to Hamas,"" says Abughosh, the journalist and analyst. Many Palestinians point to Israel's continuing air-and-ground assaults on Gaza — killing nearly 20,000 Palestinians since the war began in October, according to Gaza's Health Ministry — as evidence that co-existence is not possible. In the West Bank, too, there has been increased violence by Israeli settlers and more aggressive Israeli military raids into refugee camps that have killed more than 290 Palestinians since Oct. 7, according to United Nations figures. ""The nonstop violence is really radicalizing all Palestinian society,"" says Quran, who himself is not a supporter of Hamas and supports a nonviolent end to the war. ""Basically, the people do not feel safe around anyone who even professes support for Israel.

139,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/20/1220602482/hamas-leader-visits-cairo-a-sign-of-movement-on-possible-gaza-truce-and-hostage-,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Hamas' top leader traveled to Cairo on Wednesday for talks on the war in Gaza, part of a flurry of diplomacy aimed at securing another cease-fire and hostage swap at a moment when the militant group is putting up stiff resistance to Israel's offensive. Ismail Haniyeh's visit came a day after Hamas fired rockets that set off air raid sirens in central Israel, a show of strength during a 10-week war that has devastated much of northern Gaza, killed nearly 20,000 Palestinians, and driven some 1. 9 million — nearly 85% of the population — from their homes. Israel has called on the rest of the world to blacklist Hamas as a terrorist organization, saying it must be eradicated in the wake of its Oct. 7 rampage across southern Israel that triggered the war. But the sides have recently relaunched indirect talks, mediated by Egypt and Qatar, aimed at instituting another cease-fire and freeing more hostages captured in that attack in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Mobile phone and internet service was down across Gaza again on Wednesday, an outage that could complicate efforts to communicate with Hamas' leaders inside the territory who went into hiding after Oct. 7. Despite a burst of activity by high-level officials in recent days, the two sides appeared to be far from an agreement. Hamas has said no more hostages will be released until the war ends, and is expected to insist on the release of large numbers of Palestinian prisoners, including high-level militants, for the captives that remain — demands Israel has thus far rejected. Egypt, along with Qatar, helped mediate a weeklong cease-fire in November in which Hamas freed over 100 hostages in exchange for Israel's release of 240 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas and other militants are still holding an estimated 129 captives. Hamas said that Haniyeh — who is believed to be based in Qatar but whose movements are rarely publicized — would discuss the war with Egyptian officials, without providing more details. Ziad Nakhaleh, the leader of the smaller Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, which took part in the Oct. 7 attack and is also holding hostages, said he had also been invited to Egypt for talks and would travel there in the coming days. Egypt, which borders Gaza, is deeply concerned about a potential influx of Palestinian refugees, fearing Israel will not allow them to return. At least 46 people were killed and more than 100 wounded early Wednesday as Israel continued to bombard the urban Jabaliya refugee camp near Gaza City, according to Munir al-Bursh, a senior Health Ministry official. In southern Gaza, several women and children were among those brought into Nasser Hospital in the city of Khan Younis after strikes overnight and into Wednesday. A boy could be seen sobbing next to his wounded mother, who was laid out on a stretcher, before being lifted up and placed on her chest. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Tuesday that Israeli forces were entering Hamas' tunnel network in northern Gaza as part of a ""final clearing"" of militants from the region. The densely built urban north — including Gaza City, the territory's largest — has seen ferocious fighting, with Palestinian health officials reporting dozens of people killed in bombardment in recent days. Gallant said that in southern Gaza, where the military launched a ground incursion focused on Khan Younis in early December, operations will take ""months. ""The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Tuesday the death toll since the start of the war had risen to more than 19,600. It does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths. Hamas and other militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack. Israel's military says 134 of its soldiers have been killed in the Gaza ground offensive. Israel says it has killed some 7,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames civilian deaths on Hamas, saying it uses them as human shields when it fights in residential areas. U. N. Security Council members are negotiating an Arab-sponsored resolution to halt the fighting in some way to allow for an increase in desperately needed humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza. A vote on the resolution, first scheduled for Monday, was pushed back again until Wednesday as talks continued in the hopes of getting the U. S. to abstain or vote ""yes"" on the resolution after it vetoed an earlier cease-fire call. France, the United Kingdom and Germany — some of Israel's closest allies — joined global calls for a cease-fire over the weekend. In Israel, protesters have called for negotiations with Hamas to facilitate the release of scores of hostages still held by the group. Israel says it will keep fighting until it has removed Hamas from power, dismantled its armed wing and returned all the hostages. U. S. President Joe Biden's administration has called on Israel to take greater steps to spare civilians but has continued to provide diplomatic and military support for the offensive.",npr_articles/article_139.txt,npr_results/article_139.txt.json
140,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/19/1219748268/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-hamas-iran-war,"BEIRUT — When the war in Gaza began in early October, it also broke a 17-year stretch of relative calm across the Lebanese-Israeli border, raising fears of a second front plunging the region into a wider conflict. In 2006, the killing and kidnapping of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militia, sparked a 34-day war that killed more than 1,100 Lebanese and 165 Israelis, and heavily damaged Lebanon's infrastructure. Attacks in the following years were sporadic enough that the United Nations peacekeeping force along the border believed the next step could be a permanent cease-fire. And then came Oct 7. The Hamas attack that day from Gaza into southern Israel has been followed by a war between the militant Palestinian group and Israeli forces that so far has killed more than 19,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry. Israel says about 1,200 people were killed in the Oct. 7 attack. After the Gaza war started, Hezbollah responded by attacking Israeli targets in northern Israel. Hezbollah insists it did not know in advance of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack. It has traded attacks with Israel in a relatively narrow zone across Israel's northern border in an effort to tie up Israeli military resources that would otherwise be deployed in Gaza. Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim movement, was founded after Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Although it supports Hamas, which is predominantly Sunni Muslim, it is not believed to carry out extensive coordination with the Palestinian group. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to turn southern Lebanon and Beirut ""into Gaza"" if Hezbollah declares all-out war on Israel. Israeli forces in Gaza have flattened entire city blocks, bombed hospitals and heavily damaged infrastructure. Analysts say both Israel and Hezbollah, along with Iran, would like to avoid all-out war. Here are keys to understanding why all three would prefer to avoid an escalation — and why they may not be able to. Except during a week-long cease-fire last month, Israel and Hezbollah have launched multiple attacks every day across the Israel-Lebanon border since Oct. 8. Those attacks have been largely confined to a swath of land three to four miles deep on each side of the border, despite the capability on both sides to reach much farther. Hezbollah says 94 of its fighters have been killed near the Lebanese border by Israeli strikes, and the Lebanese military says one Lebanese soldier has been killed. Lebanese media report at least 17 civilians have been killed. Three of them were journalists or media workers, including Reuters visuals journalist Issam Abdallah, who was killed by a tank round in what a Reuters investigation said appeared to be a targeted attack. Israel says at least 11 soldiers and civilians have been killed on the Israeli side of the border. The fighting ""overall has been very, very localized. That also shows somehow that there is not a real appetite for wider conflict in this region,"" says Andrea Tenenti, spokesperson for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL. The peacekeeping force was established 45 years ago to oversee Israel's withdrawal that year after it invaded Lebanon following Palestinian commando attacks. Tenenti says both Israel and Hezbollah have unfailingly accepted messages passed through UNIFIL in procedures designed to deescalate potentially dangerous misunderstandings — a further sign of the desire to avoid wider conflict. UNIFIL does not deal directly with Hezbollah, which the U. S. designates as a terrorist organization, but coordinates with the Lebanese Army. Tenenti describes increased attacks earlier this month as part of a pattern of sporadic escalation rather than a signal that the entire border conflict had intensified. He and several analysts say, however, that it would take only one incident — the killing of a large number of civilians, for instance — to unintentionally escalate the conflict. ""In my view, Hezbollah is going to maintain the tempo of firing into northern Israel to demonstrate its 'resistance' credentials and show solidarity with the Palestinians, but not attempt to do anything that would provoke full-scale war with the Israelis,"" says Jeffrey Feltman, a former U. S. assistant secretary of state and U. N. undersecretary general. ""After all, the primary purpose of Hezbollah's massive arsenal is to deter Israel from a massive strike on Iran or to retaliate in case of such a strike,"" says Feltman, now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. Hezbollah is considered by security analysts to be one of the most heavily armed paramilitaries in the world. Its leader Hassan Nasrallah has said the militia possesses rockets that can reach all parts of Israel and is increasingly using precision guidance systems for targeting. Iran is the group's major supplier of weapons. ""Full-scale confrontation between Israel and Hezbollah"" is too high a price for Iran to pay, says Raz Zimmt, with the Moshe Dayan Institute for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University. ""It's just not worthwhile, at least for now. "" He believes Iran has assessed that Hamas does not now require intervention. ""The rules Hezbollah has been following until now . . . are more acting in reaction to Israeli escalation, rather than engaging in escalation on its own,"" says Randa Slim, Beirut-based senior fellow with the Middle East Institute. ""They don't want to be seen as dragging Lebanon into all-out war now,"" she says, citing Lebanon's deep financial crisis and political paralysis. Lebanon's economy has contracted over the past four years while the value of its currency continues to fall and poverty increases amid what the World Bank says is one of the highest inflation rates in the world. Economic and financial reforms have been stalled by a political crisis that has left the fragmented country without a president for more than a year. In addition to its armed force, Hezbollah also has a powerful political wing that is part of the Lebanese government. Hezbollah wants to avoid being blamed by the Lebanese public for exposing the country to another war, says Feltman. ""But this is an extremely dangerous game,"" he says. ""Hezbollah could easily miscalculate, misread Israeli red lines and invite the very destruction its arms are in part intended to deter. ""Both Iran and Hezbollah have insisted they were not informed in advance of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in Israel. Hezbollah has made clear that its goal in the cross-border attacks is to tie up Israeli military resources that would otherwise be used in Gaza. And Iran's priority in avoiding a wider war seems to be not jeopardizing a historic détente agreement reached earlier this year with traditional Sunni Arab rival Saudi Arabia, says Slim. The two countries' agreement to establish diplomatic ties after years of animosity was an important step for Iran, which has been isolated internationally and largely isolated from the Arab world. ""I think there is some kind of status quo that they have now established, especially in their relationship with Saudi Arabia. They feel that any escalation will upend that,"" Slim says. In a speech in November, Hezbollah's reclusive leader told followers that their battle with Israel would be won by incremental gains. ""It may seem modest to some who expect or demand that Hezbollah quickly enter a full war with the enemy,"" Hassan Nasrallah said of attacks across the Lebanese border. ""We still need time, to be realistic,"" he said, ""but we win and achieve victory by points. ""Despite the apparent reluctance by Iran and Hezbollah to significantly escalate the conflict, Slim says, they could take a different tack if Israel tries to push Hezbollah forces further from the border in line with a 2006 U. N. Security Council resolution that ended war with Israel. The Security Council resolution called for Hezbollah to retreat north of the Litani River in Lebanon — more than 10 miles from its existing positions. That resolution envisioned the Lebanese Army, which is weaker and less well-equipped than Hezbollah, replacing the militia. Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told mayors of northern Israeli towns earlier this month that if the Security Council does not reinforce the resolution, Israel is prepared to physically push Hezbollah back, according to Israeli media. Israel has evacuated tens of thousands of villagers from near the border with Lebanon. Tens of thousands of Lebanese have also fled their homes. While support for Hezbollah is strong in Lebanon, particularly in the largely Shia Muslim south, it does not enjoy universal backing across the country. Lebanon is a mosaic of ethnic and religious groups — and increasingly, citizens who place stability over personal identity. Yet the daily images of Israeli destruction and Palestinians killed in Gaza are swaying public opinion. At a rally near the Martyrs' Monument in downtown Beirut on Dec. 11, a small group of women held aloft Palestinian flags in solidarity with a global strike called by Palestinian groups to press for a cease-fire in Gaza. The Lebanese government ordered public offices, banks and schools closed to support the call. ""We all fear war and we are all desperate, but for us now it's the genocide in Gaza that needs to stop,"" said Dania Dandashli, a psychologist. ""We are concerned about the escalation in Lebanon, but if this is going to turn into a regional war, I'm thinking, let it be.

141,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/18/1219955657/israel-war-gaza-lloyd-austin,"TEL AVIV, Israel —  Pressure was mounting on Israel Monday to begin bringing the war in Gaza to a close, as U. S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with military officials to relay Biden administration concerns over the heavy death toll for Palestinian civilians. The United Nations Security Council was also gearing up for yet another vote this week on a resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire. The U. S. defense secretary arrived in Israel on Monday, meeting in Tel Aviv with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant. Austin said U. S. support for Israel is unshakeable. Israel, he said, ""has every right to defend itself,"" adding however that ""protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza is both a moral duty and a strategic imperative. ""Austin's remarks echoed those of other senior American officials who have recently visited Israel, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. U. S. officials are urging Israel to transition from its intense bombing campaign in Gaza to more a more surgical ground operation. Austin said he is not dictating a timeline or terms. Gallant only said the war will take time. The Biden administration has remained firmly behind Israel in its stated goal to ""crush Hamas,"" but in recent weeks officials have expressed growing concern about the number of civilian casualties in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis unfolding there. President Biden has urged Israel to ""be focused on how to save civilian lives. "" Austin, in a speech earlier this month, warned Israel that it risked ""strategic defeat"" if it didn't minimize Palestinian casualties. In an earlier post, Austin said he also planned to travel to Bahrain and Qatar ""to underscore U. S. commitments to strengthening regional security and stability, and working with partners and allies to advance defense capabilities. "" Austin's visit follows a weekend in which families and supporters of hostages seized by Hamas militants during the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel renewed calls for a truce to facilitate their release after Israeli forces mistakenly shot and killed three escaped captives during combat operations in northern Gaza on Friday. In the Oct. 7 attack, Hamas killed about 1,200 people and seized some 240 hostages, Israel says. During a week-long cease-fire at the end of November, about 100 hostages were set free in exchange for some 300 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Since Israel launched an air-and-ground offensive in response to the Hamas attack, more than 18,000 people — mostly women and children — have been killed in the fighting, according to the Gaza health ministry. In a news briefing Sunday evening, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), was asked about the accidental killing of the three Israeli captives. He called the incident ""very difficult and painful"" and acknowledged that it ""very easily"" could have been avoided. He said the escaped captives ""took into account that they were taking a risk by coming to the IDF force"" and that to minimize that risk, they ""took off their shirts so that no one would think they had a charge on them and held a white cloth on a pole to identify themselves. ""Halevi also admitted that the captives had called for help in Hebrew. In New York, the U. N. Security Council was set to vote on Monday on a renewed proposal for an ""urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities"" in Gaza. Earlier this month, the U. S. used its veto power in the Security Council to block a similar measure. The U. N. World Food Program, warned Monday that ""Gazans are becoming more desperate by the day, with nowhere to go and nothing to eat. "" ""Our senior leaders saw this firsthand when they went to Gaza. Families are going days without food. To prevent further suffering, the fighting needs to stop,"" WFP said. Separately, Human Rights Watch issued a critique accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war. The group points to public statements by Israeli officials, including the nation's defense minister, expressing their aim to deprive Gaza's people of food, water and fuel. ""Israeli forces are deliberately blocking the delivery of water, food, and fuel, while willfully impeding humanitarian assistance, apparently razing agricultural areas, and depriving the civilian population of objects indispensable to their survival,"" the organization said in its report. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Lior Haiat responded to the report by calling Human Rights Watch ""an anti-Israel organization,"" according to the Times of Israel. At the Vatican, meanwhile, Pope Francis has also sought to draw the world's attention to unarmed civilians being killed in Gaza. In written remarks that followed news of an Israeli sniper killing two Palestinian Christian women sheltering at Holy Family Parish in northern Gaza, Francis said there are no terrorists at the church but rather children, nuns, families and people who are sick or have disabilities. Holy Family Parish, which also came under rocket attack, is one of just two churches in Gaza, both of which are sheltering internally displaced people. Israel's military has not responded to repeated requests for comment on the shootings. In Gaza, people had been without cell phone or internet service since Thursday before it was partly restored over the weekend. Hussein Hamouda, who like many Palestinians in Gaza has been forced to move south to avoid Israeli bombs, says he's seen several communications blackouts in the last 10 weeks, but none as bad as the latest one. ""We can't communicate with our friends, loved ones, relatives, and the outside world,"" Hamouda says. ""Before, it used to last a day, but this time it lasted two, two and a half days. We felt like we were outside the world's scope, cut off. ""Speaking Saturday, Netanyahu reiterated the need to continue the war in the face of international criticism. ""Citizens of Israel. We are fighting a war for our existence, in which we are committed to fight until victory, despite international pressure, and the unbearable heavy prices that the war is exacting from us in our precious sons and daughters,"" Netanyahu said, mourning the deaths of the three hostages, all men in their 20s. On Monday, Israel's military said it was continuing combat operations to eradicate Hamas in Gaza. During a raid at the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, the military says it located the equivalent of $1. 37 million in funds inside a senior Hamas leader's house. ""The funds were found in suitcases alongside numerous weapons,"" the IDF said. It said the money was designated for ""terrorist activity. ""The Israeli military also said its troops had struck Hamas infrastructure where explosive devices, rocket-propelled grenades, a cache of mortars and ammunition were found.

142,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/16/1219826061/israel-hostages-gaza-hamas-palestinians,"TEL AVIV, Israel — An investigation into the killing of three hostages held by Hamas in Gaza has found that the captives were shirtless and waving a white flag as Israeli soldiers fired on them. The preliminary report Saturday by the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, said the hostages had managed to evade their captors in the northern Gaza neighborhood of Shijaiyah before they were ""mistakenly identified"" as they exited a building on Friday. They were then shot by an Israeli soldier. Two were killed immediately and another was wounded and ran back into the building, an Israeli official said in a briefing on Saturday. Soldiers then heard a cry for help in Hebrew. The soldier's battalion commander ordered the firing to stop. The third hostage later died of his wounds. Last month, Hamas released more than 100 hostages in a seven-day truce in exchange for about 300 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel. The three captives killed on Friday were among the more than 100 hostages believed still held by the Palestinian militant group. The preliminary report concluded that the soldiers involved in the accidental shooting did not follow the IDF's own rules of engagement. The hostages had been dressed in civilian clothes and waving a white flag before they were shot by a soldier who felt under threat, the military official said. Hamas militants wear civilian clothes to deceive the military, the official said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the deaths of the three captives — Yotam Haim, Samer Fuad El-Talalka and Alon Shamriz, all in their 20s — an ""unbearable tragedy. ""Families of the hostages have kept up public pressure on Netanyahu's government, calling for Israel's first priority to be their safe return, and not the military operation to eradicate Hamas. Adding to that pressure in recent weeks, captives who were released during last month's cease-fire have been speaking publicly about their time in captivity. On Saturday afternoon at ""hostages square"" in central Tel Aviv, people gathered to hear from families of the captives. Ruby Chen, the father of hostage Itay Chen, 19, said he met last week with President Biden, U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other senior U. S. officials. ""We wanted to give them the gratitude of all the Jewish people [for] all they've done for us,"" Chen said. ""I don't think there was any other president who was so willing to do anything possible, 24/7, on behalf of his administration to help us see our loved ones. ""But he criticized Netanyahu's government, who he said was not interested in meeting with families of the hostages. ""The Israeli government needs to be active,"" Chen said. ""They need to put an offer on the table, including prisoners with blood on their hands,"" he said, referring to the release of Palestinians held in Israeli jails, "". . . to get the hostages back alive. ""Hadas Pilowsky-Ron echoed that sentiment, saying releasing the hostages ""must be the most important goal of the war. """"There is no choice . . . bring the hostages [home] first,"" she said. The Israeli military can always go back and get Hamas later, but ""every day that goes by, another hostage dies and this is the most important issue now. ""Earlier, on Friday evening after the news of the accidental shootings broke, a group of people gathered in central Tel Aviv and marched through the city's streets at night, calling out to others to wake up and join them. Among them was Adam Yekutieli, 37, an artist, who said the deaths of the three hostages reinforced for him that Israel needs to negotiate another cease-fire to free more of the captives. ""There's no military solution to this situation,"" he said. ""Israel is bombing its way into a corner that it won't be able to get out of. ""Meanwhile, on Friday, veteran Al Jazeera cameraman Samer Abu Daqqa was killed in Gaza by fire from an Israeli drone at a school in the city of Khan Younis, the Foreign Press Association said. The FPA said Daqqa's colleague, Wael Al-Dahdouh, was wounded in the incident. ""We consider this a grave blow to the already limited freedom of the press in Gaza and call on the army for a prompt investigation and explanation,"" the FPA said. Israel's military said in a statement that it ""takes all operationally feasible measures to protect both civilians and journalists. """"The IDF has never, and will never, deliberately target journalists,"" it said, adding that ""Given the ongoing exchanges of fire, remaining in an active combat zone has inherent risks.

143,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/16/1219245873/bethlehem-christmas-gaza-israel,"BETHLEHEM, West Bank — Jack Giacaman enjoys telling customers that every day is Christmas in his shop, which features hand-crafted olive-wood Nativity scenes, camels and crosses. But this year there will be no Christmas in the city that is synonymous with the birth of Jesus, located in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Last month, Palestinian leaders of Christian denominations here came together, and citing the devastating war in Gaza made a unanimous decision to cancel public celebrations. There's no Christmas tree or sparkling lights in Manger Square or along the cobble-stone streets that should be bustling with foreign tourists this time of year. There will be no Christmas parade with musicians weaving through the old city's labyrinth walkways, no Santas on street corners doling out joy to children. Instead, the main square is a simple parking lot, without a hint of holiday decoration to be seen. At Christmas House, Giacaman's shop, things have been bad since shortly after the Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel by Gaza-based Hamas militants that killed 1,200 people, Israel says. Israel's military has responded with an air-and-ground assault that has killed more than 18,000 people, according to Gaza's health ministry. ""This is the worst Christmas. Even during the first intifada, the second intifada, it was not like this,"" he says, referring to the Palestinian uprisings against Israel that began in 1987 and 2000, respectively. Giacaman, a Christian who has lived in Bethlehem all his life, traces his ancestry back to conquering crusaders who arrived in the area centuries ago. At his shop, a small group of artisans are hard at work, shaping statues of Mary and the infant Jesus and stamping out Christmas tree ornaments, all piled up, ready for a holiday rush that isn't coming this year. The shop has been in the family for three generations. Over the years, it's weathered more than a few shocks to the business, most recently the COVID-19 pandemic — but Giacaman says this is the worst he can remember. At home, his family is also having trouble feeling the Christmas spirit. His teenage daughters said they weren't interested in decorating this year. ""They said we don't have the feeling to put up the Christmas tree,"" he says. ""I was a little bit sad. So I just put the Nativity set on the table. ""Just off of Manger square, Osama Al-Alli chats with a dozen or so of his fellow taxi drivers, as they wait in vain for a fare. In most years, there would be ""many people coming from all the world,"" he says, with so many lights. ""Now, it's dark at night. ""Al-Alli, who is a Muslim, worries about the future. ""But I am praying for peace, for Israel and Palestine to come together,"" he says. A few feet away, stands the Church of the Nativity, famous for its grotto marking the exact location where Christians believe Jesus was born. The church, first built in the fourth century by the Roman emperor Constantine, should be packed, with a long queue snaking toward the sacred spot. But now, it's nearly empty. One of the few visitors is Florida resident Linda Nocera. It's her fifth trip to Israel, but her first visit to Bethlehem. Nocera thinks the decision by the city's churches to forego Christmas celebrations is the right one, ""because of the war and because of all of the terrible killing,"" she says. ""It's heart-wrenching and I believe it's not of God in any way, shape or form,"" she says. ""I am praying to the Lord that there will be an end [to it], forever. And there will be a solution to this. ""Near the front of the church, the Salahat family peers down the well-worn stone stairs that lead to the grotto. It's also their first time in Bethlehem. They knew there wouldn't be lights or festivities, but came anyway. They left their village east of Nablus in the West Bank before dawn for what should have taken about three hours. It turned into a seven-hour drive that included waits at several Israeli checkpoints — many new since Oct. 7 — and a route made more complicated by an Israeli-built separation barrier in and around the West Bank. The Salahats are Muslim, but Noor, 18, wanted to see Bethlehem. ""I wanted to come to learn about other religions. I want to learn about other cultures. I want to see how others celebrate,"" she says. A short walk from the Church of the Nativity is the Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church. There, the Rev. Munther Isaac and his congregation chose this year to make a statement about the killing of so many children in Gaza. Using broken cement and paving stones, they placed the baby Jesus in the center of a pile of debris from a collapsed home, inspired by television images of children being pulled from the rubble, Issac says. ""I always say we need to de-romanticize Christmas,"" he says. ""In reality, it's a story of a baby who was born in the most difficult circumstances and the Roman Empire under occupation, who survived the massacre of children himself when he was born. So the connection was natural to us. ""Issac says he's surprised at the international interest that his church has received as a result of its display of baby Jesus amid the rubble. ""We're happy that we were able to speak for our people and that this one picture spoke more than many, many words,"" he says, but adds: ""I'm still baffled and struggling as to why this picture [drew] more attention . . . than actual pictures of children in Gaza.

144,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/15/1219695220/israel-soldiers-mistakenly-kill-hostages-gaza,"The Israeli soldier who shot and killed three Israeli hostages in Gaza City after mistakenly identifying them as a threat did not follow Israel's rules of engagement, an Israeli military official said Saturday. A preliminary report on the incident also found that the hostages had been dressed in civilian clothes and waving a white flag before they were shot, the official said in a press briefing. Israel says Hamas wears civilian clothes to deceive the military. Initially it was unclear how many Israeli soldiers were involved in the incident. The incident took place Friday in the Shijaiyah neighborhood of eastern Gaza City, an area that has seen intense ground fighting between Israeli forces and the militant group Hamas since Israel launched its invasion in response to the Oct. 7 attacks. ""During the fighting in Shijaiyah, the IDF inadvertently identified three kidnapped Israelis as a threat. As a result, the IDF fired at them and they were killed,"" said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for the Israeli military, also known as the Israel Defense Forces, said Friday. ""This is a sad and painful event for all of us, and the IDF bears responsibility for everything that happened,"" he told reporters. The circumstances in which the Israeli soldier encountered the hostages, and why the soldier believed the hostages were a threat, remain unclear. An initial assessment suggested the hostages either ""fled or were abandoned"" by their captors during a skirmish, Hagari said. Asked whether the abductees had their hands up or spoke in Hebrew, Hagari responded only that the military's investigation was still underway. The issue of the hostages has roiled Israel since Oct. 7. Families of the hostages and missing have mounted major pressure on Israel's political elite — pressure that has only grown in recent weeks as more hostages have spoken out about the conditions they experienced in captivity. On Friday, news that three had been killed at the hands of an Israeli soldier prompted grief and outrage in Israel. Soon after the announcement, which came after sundown on the Jewish Sabbath, thousands of Israelis flocked to the military's headquarters in Tel Aviv to protest the hostages' deaths. Protester Ella Vinokur, 30, said she felt ""rage"" at the news. The military operation to eliminate threats to Israel must come ""second to people dying,"" she said, her voice shaking as she called for more negotiations to free the remaining hostages. ""The grief and the pain, it just keeps accumulating,"" said Addam Yekutieli, 37. ""It's even more of a tragic sign that the trajectory that we're on — it's not the right one. ""In a statement, Israel's military expressed ""deep remorse"" over the incident. ""The IDF emphasizes that this is an active combat zone in which ongoing fighting over the last few days has occurred. Immediate lessons from the event have been learned, which have been passed on to all IDF troops in the field,"" the military said. The Israeli military identified the three victims as Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 25, and Alon Shamriz, 26. Talalka, an Israeli Bedouin, was working with his father at a poultry hatchery in Kibbutz Nir Am on Oct. 7 when militants attacked, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement. Haim, a musician, and Shamriz, a computer engineering student, were at their homes in Kibbutz Kfar Aza when they were abducted, the group said. Friday was the hostages' 70th day in captivity. Militants kidnapped more than 240 Israelis and other foreign nationals during the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Some 110 have been freed, most of them during a seven-day ceasefire late last month in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel. At least 110 others are thought to remain alive in captivity in Gaza, according to the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Around 20 others are believed to be dead with their remains held by Hamas, according to Israeli officials. ""Together with the entire people of Israel, I bow my head in deep sorrow and mourn the fall of three of our dear sons who were kidnapped,"" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement.

145,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/15/1219434298/israel-hamas-gaza-palestinians-college-campus-free-speech,"The conflict between Israel and Hamas is testing the limits of free speech across college campuses. And it's also affecting those who study the Middle East. Who are they? They are the scholars who research and teach about the Middle East on college campuses in the U. S. What did it find? Notably, it found that a clear majority of U. S. -based scholars (69%) didn't just feel the need to self-censor when speaking about the Middle East in general, but specifically in academic and professional settings. Want to learn more on this conflict? Listen to Consider This on whether Biden's unconditional support of Israel is nearing its limit. What are people saying? The poll was conducted by Shibley Telhami — a professor of government and politics and the director of the University of Maryland Critical Issues Poll — and Marc Lynch — a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University. Telhami spoke to All Things Considered host Ari Shapiro about the findings and how the academic climate has shifted. On the motivations for scholars choosing to self-censor:The key is that most of it was actually fear rather than sensitivity. And so that was fascinating. There are many who self-censor because they got advice from senior colleagues or from administrators not to say anything that might be interpreted offensively by people, and it wouldn't be good for their careers, particularly assistant professors and graduate students. So that's not exactly self-censorship because you're sensitive. It's more about worried about the consequences. We had a lot of colleagues who said they were not invited when the university held events on their very issue of expertise because they were worried that their views may not conform to what is needed on campus. There were some who were told by administrators to watch out what they say publicly. So we were struck by the kind of atmosphere that a lot of our colleagues across U. S. campuses faced on this issue, much more than I would have expected. On how it is playing out:I think the universities are facing different pressures. One of the pressures, obviously, we do have real, genuine increases in antisemitism, Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian, anti-Israeli sentiment. And universities have to manage all that, and make sure that all their people feel safe. A lot of it is genuine — there's nothing un-genuine about it — it has to be taken seriously. But there are a lot of groups that act disproportionately on some of the issues. And undoubtedly a lot of the scholars who follow the issue feel that the public space does not conform to their own professional interpretations of Israel-Palestine. So they're concerned about criticizing Israel publicly. On the importance of gauging the experiences of scholars:When you explain violence, you are not embracing violence. This is something that we as social scientists all, of course, understand. We never have to repeat to ourselves. But society around us does not get it all the time because they think you're taking side when you're explaining why things happen. But if you don't explain why things happen, you're going to repeat the same mistake over and over and over again.

146,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/15/1219151214/israeli-hostages-hamas-gaza,"On Oct. 7, the Aloni family crowded inside their home's safe room as Hamas fighters rampaged through their kibbutz in southern Israel, barely two miles from Gaza. There were two grown sisters, Danielle Aloni and Sharon Aloni Cunio, along with Sharon's husband and the sisters' three young daughters. The situation was dire. Inside, the house was burning and filling with smoke. Outside, they could hear gunshots, one sister later recounted to their brother, Moran Aloni, who was not kidnapped. ""She said, 'I would rather die quickly than to suffocate along with my kids,'"" said Moran Aloni, who shared their story at a press conference organized by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an organization that was formed after Oct. 7 to advocate for the hostages. Hamas released more than a hundred hostages during a seven-day ceasefire late last month, including the two Aloni sisters and their daughters, as part of an exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel. Nearly all the Israelis released were women and minors. Sharon's husband, David Cunio, remains in captivity. Families of hostages — and some former hostages themselves — have spoken out publicly in recent days about the harsh conditions of their captivity in an effort to keep attention focused on the more than 100 hostages, among them several Americans, who are still being held by the militant group Hamas. They hope, too, to increase pressure on the Israeli government to bring those remaining home safely amid an intensive military campaign in Gaza. ""I spent 49 days in that hell. I am asking, begging from all decision makers: Get the kids out, get all of them out,"" said 85-year-old Yaffa Adar, who was kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz, speaking in a video released by the families group. Her 38-year-old grandson, Tamir Adar, is among those still in captivity. ""I want to see them now, not when I'll be in a coffin,"" she said. In total, Hamas fighters and other militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted more than 240 on Oct. 7, Israeli officials say. The families of Danielle Aloni and Sharon Aloni Cunio were jumbled up as they were taken hostage, their brother said, and one of the 3-year-old twins, Emma, was separated from them altogether. ""Someone just snatched Emma from my sister Danielle's hands,"" he said. For days, as Sharon, David and Emma's twin Yuli Cunio were held together in a small room, they were sure that Emma had died during the abduction. ""These were 10 agonizing days for them,"" Moran Aloni said. One day, Sharon heard a child's cry coming from another room nearby. ""She said to David, 'I'm hearing Emma crying. ' And David said, 'You're imagining things,' probably thought it was because of the grief,"" Moran recounted. ""But a mother is never wrong. ""Within minutes, an unknown woman entered the room with Emma in her arms, he said. Reunited, they stayed in the same room for weeks more with about 10 other hostages, fearing daily for their lives. In a meeting this month with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Cunio said they could hear Israeli airstrikes hit nearby, according to reports in Israeli media. In the small, closed room, one difficulty was managing bodily functions, especially for the small children. ""When they needed something, they needed to knock on a door. And maybe someone would come to them after one hour, maybe four hours,"" Moran said. The other sister, Danielle Aloni, was held separately, along with her 6-year-old daughter Emelia. Unlike the Cunios, they were moved around from place to place with different conditions in each location, the family said. ""You sleep and you cry,"" Danielle Aloni said in a video released by the families group. ""Every day that passes is like a never-ending eternity. ""In one of the rooms where they were held, Danielle and Emelia were ordered to be quiet for days on end. They spoke only in whispers with their fellow hostages. ""Think about the child, with nothing to do, nothing to play, unable to speak up, unable to laugh, unable to cry, unable to shout,"" Moran said. Aloni family members told Israeli TV news outlet N12 that they felt their kidnappers understood the importance of keeping the captives alive. In total, the Aloni sisters and their families spent about 50 days in captivity. Medical experts say the released hostages have come home in stable physical health but clearly showing signs of their ordeal. Returnees had typically lost 10 to 15% of their body weight, out of stress and limited access to food, said Dr. Yael Mozer-Glassberg, a physician at Schneider Children's Medical Center, a hospital near Tel Aviv that has received dozens of returning hostages. ""I've never thought in my entire career I will face that,"" Mozer-Glassberg said in the families group press conference. ""I pray that I won't face it once again in my life, because this is so devastating. ""During one patient's time in captivity, they received a cup of tea and a biscuit in the morning, a serving of rice at dinnertime, and perhaps a dried date, Mozer-Glassberg said. Other families have described similar meals in other accounts in Israeli media. Water was also limited, both for drinking and for bathing. One family took only three showers while in captivity, and another child was unable to bathe at all, she said. ""You can imagine the medical hygiene that they came back [with],"" she said. ""I've never seen in my life such a terrible, terrible hygiene. "" The poor hygiene led to skin rashes and lice for multiple patients, Mozer-Glassberg added. ""You can put your imagination and think of hygiene conditions for 54 days without a shower,"" she said. Other returnees, including Yocheved Lifshitz, an 85-year-old woman who was released in October, have described minimal health care in captivity for abductees, some of whom were injured during the attack on Oct. 7. Shortly after release, Lifshiftz told press that her captors provided food, medicine and a doctor to examine the hostages, but that the experience — which included an abduction by motorcycle during which she was beaten with a wooden pole — was ""hell. "" As for the returnees' mental health, no one can say what recovery will look like. In addition to the time in captivity, the experience on Oct. 7 was a major trauma for the hostages — their kibbutzim rampaged, their homes invaded, neighbors killed and kidnapped. Concerns about trauma are especially acute for children who were taken hostage, such as Abigail Edan, an American-Israeli who turned 4 years old while in captivity. ""I think that we will only learn as the days go on and for a long time, what really effectively will be the results of having been a hostage and having been in her father's arms when he was murdered,"" said Liz Hirsh Naftali, Edan's great-aunt, in an interview with NPR. Noam Avigdori, 12, and her mother Sharon Hertzman, 52, were visiting family in Kibbutz Be'eri on Oct. 7. They were kidnapped from a safe room in their family members' home and taken together in a van with five other women and children into Gaza. Her father Hen and 16-year-old brother were not traveling that day and were not kidnapped. Speaking at the families group press conference, Avigdori said the reunion of his family was the happiest moment of his life, even better than the birth of his first child. ""The emotion was overwhelming to all of us,"" he said. Noam came home in good physical condition, he said. She laughs still, and she can talk about her time in captivity, he added. But she sometimes wakes during the night with a scream, and she still won't let him leave her side, Avigdori said. ""I just ask her, 'Can I get the trash now?' And she won't permit it,"" he said. The Israeli prime minister's office has revised the number of hostages thought to remain alive in Gaza. As of Thursday, that estimate stood at 115. Hamas also holds the remains of about 20 dead, Israeli officials now say, though it is unclear if they died on Oct. 7 or in captivity. Hamas has said that Israeli airstrikes have killed some hostages. About eight of the remaining hostages are thought to be American, the Biden administration says. On Wednesday, their families met with President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the White House. Most of the remaining hostages are men, Israeli officials say. A small number are women. Some are Israeli soldiers. Avigdori recently received a phone call from a father whose 24-year-old son is among those still being held, he said. The father's pain was so moving that Avigdori felt he had to lie, he added. ""And I started to say things [without] necessarily believing in them 100%. But this man was drowning in despair. I have to say something,"" Avigdori said. ""He saw the picture of me hugging my wife, my boy hugging his sister. I have to give him hope, because hope is all I had for 50 days. ""Negotiations to release more hostages fell apart late last month. Afterward, the temporary ceasefire ended, and the Israeli military has since resumed its offensive. The death toll in Gaza has now reached over 18,700, according to health officials in the Hamas-controlled territory. (The toll does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. Health officials say a majority of the dead are women and children. )Netanyahu has faced outrage from the families of the missing, who say Israel is not doing enough to bring them home safely. The accounts from the released hostages have only increased that pressure. Netanyahu said last week that Israel will ""spare no effort"" to return them. ""Any government — the Israeli government, the American government, the Qatari government, any government that is involved right now, or touching the issue of the hostages —  is to prioritize bringing all the hostages home alive,"" said Gillian Kaye, speaking in an interview with NPR. Her stepson, Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, remains a hostage. Additional reporting by Alon Avital in Tel Aviv.",npr_articles/article_146.txt,npr_results/article_146.txt.json
147,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/14/1218729551/lebanon-israel-border-hezbollah-conflict,"KFAR KELA, Lebanon — Since the war in Gaza began, this quiet farming village along the Israeli border has found itself on the front lines of a parallel conflict — the patios of gracious stone homes now a dangerous front-row seat to the attacks between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, occupying the south of the country for 18 years. Fighting flared again into war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militia. Since then, despite sporadic attacks, this region of southern Lebanon, with its rich soil and olive groves, has been stable enough that many villagers built sprawling homes on land they have farmed for generations. One of them is Ibrahim Hamoud, 72, who sat on a plastic chair on a patio covered with broken glass two weeks ago, on what turned out to be the last day of a weeklong truce between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that rules the Gaza Strip. The temporary cease-fire was accompanied by a halt in almost all attacks across the Lebanese border, just a few hundred yards from his home. He had worked in construction in Africa for five years, away from his family, he said, to save money to build his dream house here. It was hit by Israeli shelling just before midnight ahead of the cease-fire that began on Nov. 24. He was asleep upstairs when the metal tore through the first floor. ""Well it's up to God, what can I tell you?"" he said, explaining his belief that it is predetermined when he dies. At the main entrance to Hamoud's home, part of the elegant black double doors flanked by white stone pillars has been shattered by the blast and lies in pieces in the yard. Inside, part of the ceiling has caved in and plaster and broken glass cover the red velvet sofa cushions. The kitchen and bedrooms downstairs are filled with rubble. Hamoud's wife, Widad Ghareeb, looks pensively at the smashed shelves of a wooden sideboard used to store special linens and china. ""Now I know you should never save things for special occasions,"" she said. ""You should use everything all the time. ""Ghareeb was staying with a daughter in another village when her home was hit. She said she goes back there every night not just because she is afraid, but with only her husband for company, she is lonely. ""I'd rather they call me a coward a thousand times than say once, 'God rest her soul,'"" said Ghareeb, who has four children and 13 grandchildren. ""Now it's become like a ghost town around me here. There are no neighbors around anymore. I just want someone to keep me company. ""When the attacks between Hezbollah and Israel began on Oct. 8, most of the family decamped to the home of the daughter Ghareeb is staying with in the village of Nabatieh. But it was so crowded that most found other places to stay and, like many of the thousands of families who fled the border region, they are scattered throughout Lebanon. Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim movement, says 92 of its fighters have been killed in the cross-border attacks, while Agence France-Presse also counts the killings of at least 17 civilians, including three journalists. Israeli news reports say at least 10 Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed by Hezbollah strikes. Many Lebanese villagers live in sight of Israeli towns on what older people still remember as Palestinian land. One of the casualties of the war, along with the dead and wounded, has been the belief by Lebanese families that despite the chaos of their country, they could build lives here. Next door to Hamoud's house, Ali Suleiman, a 22-year-old university student, took advantage of the temporary cease-fire to start repairing his grandparents' apartment building. The two-story building housing their extended family was built over many years by money his grandparents made in Kuwait. Now, it is so heavily damaged, he and a friend were taking sledgehammers to knock down a wall that is no longer stable. Suleiman said his grandparents had left for Beirut a few days before the first airstrike hit their building on Oct. 22 — creating a tank-round-sized hole in one wall. Fire raced through the apartments, scorching the walls and melting blades of metal ceiling fans. In the kitchen, jars of homemade hot pepper sauce and thickened yogurt balls in olive oil now covered in plaster sit next to a sink filled with glass shards. Cheery red pot holders hang from the twisted door of the oven. A set of turquoise prayer beads lies on the floor in the rubble. Suleiman's loyalties are as clear as the tattoos of Shia poems along his arms. ""Even if the house is destroyed, that's better than a single Hezbollah fighter being hurt by a thorn,"" he said. ""If Hezbollah were not here, what happened to us would be worse than what happened in Gaza. But Israel could not do anything because we have Hezbollah. ""The United States designates all of Hezbollah a terrorist organization, while the European Union considers its military but not political wing as such. In Lebanon though, Hezbollah is the most powerful security force and the most prominent political player in the country. Although Hezbollah is not universally supported throughout Lebanon, the Shia Muslim movement has particularly strong support in the south. The view from Suleiman's roof is a snapshot of decades of Middle East history. Just a few hundred yards away are blue posts that mark the United Nations-delineated ""blue line"" drawn up in 2000 to determine whether Israel had completely withdrawn from Lebanon after its 18-year-long occupation. Just behind that is the 30-foot concrete wall that Israel began building in 2012 as a barrier between the two countries. The wall stretches for miles along the border, at times running parallel to a road where on this day a Lebanese family with two young girls stepped out of their car to take photos next to hand-painted murals commemorating Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque along with figures who are heroes to Palestinians and Lebanese. Israeli surveillance drones buzzed overhead as they have every day since the war in Gaza began. The spokesman for U. N. peacekeepers along the border said while the attacks between Israel and Hezbollah have become more targeted and precise, with explosive drones and more sophisticated rockets, the conflict along the border is still contained to the border areas. ""It's still very much localized,"" said Andrea Tenenti, spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon, created to monitor Israel's withdrawal from the country in 1978. While Israel ordered civilians to evacuate a wide area near its border after the war in Gaza started, Lebanese villagers were largely left to decide whether to seek safety elsewhere. Which is why Hamoud stayed put even as his dream house was attacked. ""She leaves and I stay at home,"" he said, referring to Ghareeb, who was packing clothes to take to her daughter's house for the night. She said she prayed the cease-fire they were enjoying would become permanent. Tomorrow, God willing, ""things will improve and there will be a cease-fire and we can come back and not leave,"" she said. ""Really we don't know what to do, where to settle . . . we are lost. ""She climbed into a car crowded with five other women, leaving behind her husband and a friend sitting on the plastic chairs as two cats picked their way delicately around the shards of glass. Hamoud said he takes precautions, staying in a corner of the safest room when airstrikes start, but with no shelters there's little else he can do. Hamoud's friend, who asked to be called Abu Walid, the name his friends know him by, said he had so far slept in his home in Houla, a border town that has been even harder hit by Israeli strikes than Kafr Kela. ""These past 45, 46 days I have stayed there,"" he said. ""Of course you get calls from your children, your buddies, your brothers saying, 'Get out of there. What are you waiting for?'""He and Hamoud agreed that everyone who has gone to stay with relatives had suffered the indignity of asking for help. ""Your brother or father or neighbor or someone close to you can bear you as a guest one or two or three days,"" said Abu Walid. ""Then it's better to stay in your home to preserve your dignity and your relationships with people. ""Abu Walid said he did not want his full name used because he didn't trust people he didn't know, particularly journalists. His town, Houla, is known to almost every Lebanese school child as the site of one of the deadliest massacres in the 1948 war that created Israel. Dozens of men who had surrendered were shot dead by Israeli forces in a house that was blown up on top of them. The army company commander was found guilty in an Israel court of shooting 15 of them. He ended up serving one year in prison. ""It is an unhealable wound,"" Abu Walid said of the massacre. ""There is not a family in Houla who did not lose someone,"" he said, noting that the descendants of the dead men would have made up their own village by now had they lived. The next day, Dec. 1, the cease-fire was broken. Abu Walid, reached by phone, said his aunt and son were killed in their home, buried in rubble when an Israeli airstrike hit their house in Houla. Hezbollah claimed the young man as one of its fighters. The day after that, Hamoud said another airstrike had hit his house. A video he sent showed it almost completely demolished. Hamoud said he had finally decided to stay somewhere safer at night but sneaks back quickly in the day to feed his goats. He said he planned to try to repair his house, he hoped with the help of Hezbollah, which in 2006 compensated villagers for damage to their homes caused by fighting. ""Of course we will rebuild,"" he said. ""It is our land. Nobody can take our land. """,npr_articles/article_147.txt,npr_results/article_147.txt.json
148,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/14/1218643254/israel-is-using-an-ai-system-to-find-targets-in-gaza-experts-say-its-just-the-st,"The pace is astonishing: In the wake of the brutal attacks by Hamas-led militants on October 7, Israeli forces have struck more than 22,000 targets inside Gaza, a small strip of land along the Mediterranean coast. Just since the temporary truce broke down on December 1, Israel's Air Force has hit more than 3,500 sites. The Israeli military says it's using artificial intelligence to select many of these targets in real-time. The military claims that the AI system, named ""the Gospel,"" has helped it to rapidly identify enemy combatants and equipment, while reducing civilian casualties. But critics warn the system is unproven at best — and at worst, providing a technological justification for the killing of thousands of Palestinian civilians. ""It appears to be an attack aimed at maximum devastation of the Gaza Strip,"" says Lucy Suchman, an anthropologist and professor emeritus at Lancaster University in England who studies military technology. If the AI system is really working as claimed by Israel's military, ""how do you explain that?"" she asks. Other experts question whether any AI can take on a job as consequential as targeting humans on the battlefield. ""AI algorithms are notoriously flawed with high error rates observed across applications that require precision, accuracy, and safety,"" warns Heidy Khlaaf, Engineering Director of AI Assurance at Trail of Bits, a technology security firm. Despite these concerns, most experts agree that this is the beginning of a new phase in the use of AI in warfare. Algorithms can sift through mounds of intelligence data far faster than human analysts, says Robert Ashley, a former head of the U. S. Defense Intelligence Agency. Using AI to assist with targeting has the potential to give commanders an enormous edge. ""You're going to make decisions faster than your opponent, that's really what it's about,"" he says. Here's what's known about the Gospel, and what it means for the future of warfare. Militaries all over the world have been experimenting with AI for more than a decade, according to Anthony King, professor of defense and security studies at the University of Exeter in England. ""The attraction is clear,"" he says. Most modern militaries are shrinking in size, and need technology to help bridge the gap. AI systems can help them search enormous quantities of intelligence data to try and find the enemy. According to posts on the Israeli military's website, the Gospel was developed by Israel's signals intelligence branch, known as Unit 8200. The system is relatively new — one of the earliest mentions was a top innovation award that it won in 2020. The Gospel is actually one of several AI programs being used by Israeli intelligence, according to Tal Mimran, a lecturer at Hebrew University in Jerusalem who has worked for the Israeli government on targeting during previous military operations. Other AI systems aggregate vast quantities of intelligence data and classify it. The final system is the Gospel, which makes a targeting recommendation to a human analyst. Those targets could be anything from individual fighters, to equipment like rocket launchers, or facilities such as Hamas command posts. ""Basically Gospel imitates what a group of intelligence officers used to do in the past,"" he says. But the Gospel is much more efficient. He says a group of 20 officers might produce 50-100 targets in 300 days. By comparison, Mimran says he thinks the Gospel and its associated AI systems can suggest around 200 targets ""within 10-12 days"" — a rate that's at least 50 times faster. Although it's not known exactly what data the Gospel uses to make its suggestions, it likely comes from a wide variety of different sources. The list includes things like cell phone messages, satellite imagery, drone footage and even seismic sensors, according to Blaise Misztal, vice president for policy at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America, a group that facilitates military cooperation between Israel and the United States. Misztal's group documented one of the first trials of the Gospel, during a 2021 conflict in Gaza between Israel and the militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad. According to press reports and statements from the military itself, Israel used the Gospel and other AI programs to identify likely targets such as rocket launchers. The system was used to identify static targets as well as moving targets as they appeared on the battlefield. According to press reports, it identified around 200 targets in the conflict. But it was not without its problems. The after-action report by Misztal's group noted that, while the AI had plenty of training data for what constituted a target, it lacked data on things that human analysts had decided were not targets. The Israeli military hadn't collected the target data its analysts had discarded, and as a result the system's training had been biased. ""It's been two years since then, so it's something that, hopefully, they've been able to rectify,"" Misztal says. Israel's latest military operation in Gaza began in response to the October 7 attack that killed roughly 1,200 people, according to the Israeli government. The military says that it is trying to eliminate the threat from Hamas and rescue hostages. It says Hamas has complicated the fight by using civilians as human shields and operating in tunnels under civilian areas. A brief blog post by the Israeli military on November 2 lays out how the Gospel is being used in the current conflict. According to the post, the military's Directorate of Targets is using the Gospel to rapidly produce targets based on the latest intelligence. The system provides a targeting recommendation for a human analyst who then decides whether to pass it along to soldiers in the field.  ""This isn't just an automatic system,"" Misztal emphasizes. ""If it thinks it finds something that could be a potential target, that's flagged then for an intelligence analyst to review. ""The post states that the targeting division is able to send these targets to the air force and navy, and directly to ground forces via an app known as ""Pillar of Fire,"" which commanders carry on military-issued smartphones and other devices. King believes this conflict may be the first time that AI-generated targets are being rolled out on a large scale to try and influence a military operation. ""This latest war in Gaza is going to proliferate this kind of technique out to the regular army,"" he says. It's unclear exactly how many targets from the Gospel have been acted upon, but the Israeli military says it is currently striking as many as 250 targets a day. The Israeli military did not respond directly to NPR's inquiries about the Gospel. In the November 2 post, it said the system allows the military to ""produce targets for precise attacks on infrastructures associated with Hamas, while causing great damage to the enemy and minimal harm to those not involved,"" according to an unnamed spokesperson. But critics question whether the Gospel and other associated AI systems are in fact performing as the military claims. Khlaaf notes that artificial intelligence depends entirely on training data to make its decisions. ""The nature of AI systems is to provide outcomes based on statistical and probabilistic inferences and correlations from historical data, and not any type of reasoning, factual evidence, or 'causation,'"" she says. ""Given the track record of high error-rates of AI systems, imprecisely and biasedly automating targets is really not far from indiscriminate targeting. ""Some accusations about the Gospel go further. A report by the Israeli publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call asserts that the system is being used to manufacture targets so that Israeli military forces can continue to bombard Gaza at an enormous rate, punishing the general Palestinian population. NPR has not independently verified those claims, and it's unclear how many targets are currently being generated by AI alone. But there has been a substantial increase in targeting, according to the Israeli military's own numbers. In the 2021 conflict, Israel said it struck 1,500 targets in Gaza, approximately 200 of which came from the Gospel. Since October 7, the military says it has struck more than 22,000 targets inside Gaza — a daily rate more than double that of the 2021 conflict. The toll on Palestinian civilians has been enormous. More than 18,000 Palestinians have died so far, the majority of whom are women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry. One in three buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, according to an independent analysis by Corey Scher of New York's CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University. The huge volume of targets is also likely putting pressure on the humans asked to review them, says Suchman. ""In the face of this kind of acceleration, those reviews become more and more constrained in terms of what kind of judgment people can actually exercise,"" she says. Mimran adds that, under pressure, analysts will be more likely to accept the AI's targeting recommendations, regardless of whether they are correct. Targeting officers may be tempted to think that ""life will be much easier if we flow with the machine and accept its advice and recommendations,"" he says. But it could create a ""whole new level of problems"" if the machine is systematically misidentifying targets. Finally, Khlaaf points out that the use of AI could make it more difficult to pursue accountability for those involved in the conflict. Although humans still retain the legal culpability for strikes, it's unclear who is responsible if the targeting system fails. Is it the analyst who accepted the AI recommendation? The programmers who made the system? The intelligence officers who gathered the training data?""Given the lack of explainability of the decisions output by AI systems, and the sheer scale and complexity of these models, it then becomes impossible to trace decisions to specific design points that can hold any individual or military accountable,"" she says. While Israel's use of the Gospel to generate a full set of targets may be unique, the nation is hardly alone in using AI to assist in intelligence analysis. The U. S. is actively working with many different kinds of AI to try and identify targets in the field. One suite of AI tools, known as Project Maven, is run through the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which collects massive quantities of satellite imagery — far more than a human analyst could search. Ashley wouldn't comment on any particular AI tool used by the U. S. intelligence community, but he says often these systems will stitch together multiple layers of AI. Some excel at finding objects in images while others can sort through things like radio transmissions. Ashley says that like the Israeli system, the U. S. has human analysts and commanders making the final decisions about what to strike. He believes other nations are working on similar systems. ""You know the Russians are doing it, you know the Chinese are doing it,"" he says. Ashley sees the proliferation of AI for this kind of work as inevitable, in part because it can be done with off-the-shelf commercial computer-vision algorithms. ""Rather than using the algorithm to ""find a particular widget, I'm looking for a tank or an anti-aircraft gun,"" he says. ""It's dual-use technology. ""King believes such targeting algorithms are an intermediate step for autonomous systems that will eventually be deployed to the battlefield. These robotic systems will likely be able to identify and kill targets without much or any human intervention. King says it's likely to make combat in the future even faster and deadlier, but the nature of war will remain the same. ""Human combat teams augmented by really lethal weapons to fight these hideous kinds of medieval fights,"" he says. ""That's where I see warfare going.

149,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/13/1217505378/north-israel-lebanon-border-hezbollah-threat,"LEHAVOT HABASHAN, Israel — It's a spring-like day in the Upper Galilee region, a strip of northern Israeli territory between Lebanon and the Golan Heights. Raanan Momika is working in his mountain bike shop in a kibbutz called Lehavot Habashan. This afternoon — and for weeks since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel — there are no customers, no tourists interested in guided trips through the rolling hills.  The kibbutz itself appears almost empty. ""Because of the war now it's a bad situation, we don't have customers, nobody wants to come,"" he says. This region is viewed by many Israelis as a Vermont-like escape from the bustle and churn of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. There are beautiful farms and kibbutzim, lush scenery and a slower pace of life. But now Israel's government has evacuated more than 40 communities in this area, because of the threat of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia that operates nearby across the Lebanon border. More than 60,000 people were required to leave their homes. Many other families, including Momika's neighbors, left voluntarily. Those who've been ordered to go are receiving government subsidies; many others say they're receiving no aid. ""Now we are just half people here in the kibbutz,"" he says. ""We're just living day-to-day. I'm not afraid if you ask me. ""For decades people here say they grew used to regular rocket, artillery and sniper fire exchanged between Israel's military and Hezbollah. Now the fear is that Hezbollah could send fighters across the border to raid homes and take prisoners, as Hamas did in the south. Asked if he thinks about leaving, as so many others have done, Momika pauses then says, ""No, not yet, not yet. It's my place. My home, I was born here. ""From the time the kibbutz began in the 1950s, Israelis who settled here faced hostility and tension from some Palestinian and other Arab neighbors, current residents say. ""My grandfather and grandmother were like pioneers,"" says Ziv Marom, who runs a coffee shop in the kibbutz that's also mostly empty now. ""They decided to build a kibbutz on the northern border, which was very dangerous. The Arabs didn't want them here. ""There were full-scale wars fought on this frontier in the 1980s and again in 2006. Both sides regularly trade artillery and sniper fire. After Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, there's been more shooting, more rockets.  Marom says the war seems to have ended a hopeful chapter for his community. ""The Galil is the most beautiful place in Israel,"" Marom says, using the Hebrew name for the region. ""It was developing, developing, developing. It was crazy how beautiful it was. Now people who live in kibbutz near the border are not planning to come back. ""Marom says he's chosen to stay but he understands why families, especially with children, are leaving. ""It could be the same, the same event here in the north,"" he says, before suggesting that an attack here could be even worse than Oct. 7, when Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials. ""Hezbollah is a stronger army than Hamas. ""When I ask what Israel should do to give them back their sense of safety, Marom voices an idea shared with NPR by people in the north over and over:  Many want a full-scale war against Hezbollah. ""I know now we have to crush them and crush them big time,"" he says. ""They understand power and that's what we need to show, because we have power. ""Not all Israelis share the view that a wider conflict will lead to more security.  And the United States and other countries are scrambling to contain the conflict, hoping to limit it to Gaza and the already bloody fight between Israel and Hamas. Israel has battled forces in Lebanon before, including in 1982 and in 2006, leaving many casualties. Another war there could have a heavy toll and risk broadening into a wider regional conflict, analysts warn. In the 2006 conflict, 1,300 Lebanese and 165 Israelis were killed. ""A new war will dwarf that of 2006 because of the much-improved military capabilities of Hezbollah and of the extreme right leanings of Israel's ruling politicians,"" Bilal Saab, a Middle East security analyst, wrote last month for the Chatham House think tank. In the Upper Galilee, meanwhile Israeli solders like Zohar Ben Shushan say the danger posed by Hezbollah has escalated, threatening the entire region. ""We think that they have a lot of power and more ways to attack us and hurt our community here in the north,"" says Ben Shushan, age 24, a reservist from the northern city of Haifa.  ""So it really feels like protecting my home. ""Ben Shushan is based at a forward lookout post that serves as one of the closest defensive positions Israel's army maintains on the Lebanon border.  Lebanese villages, also largely abandoned because of the fighting, are visible a short distance away. NPR has sent reporters to those towns to speak to Lebanese who've chosen to remain. Many feel that without Hezbollah protecting them, Israel would invade Lebanon as it's done in the past. Israeli soldiers, meanwhile, view Hezbollah fighters as a daily threat, well armed and organized. On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a warning to the group. ""If Hezbollah chooses to start an all-out war,"" he said, ""it will single-handedly turn Beirut and southern Lebanon into Gaza and Khan Younis. "" Khan Younis is a city in the Gaza Strip heavily damaged by Israeli airstrikes and ground operations. ""Sometimes it's scary,"" Ben Shushan says. ""One time I was in the shower and the shooting started. They really can attack you anytime. ""Many Israelis who consider the Upper Galilee home told NPR the Israeli army's presence is comforting but not enough. They say the border is too big, too porous to defend reliably. In the city of Nazareth, a 90-minute drive away from the frontier, people evacuated from northern communities are being housed by the government in hotels. ""We are here already five weeks, a little bit more than 300 people,"" says Erez Bergman from the Kibbutz Snir. His entire community is here, men, women and a lot of kids, including his own. He says after seeing what happened during the Hamas attack, and how slow Israel's army was to respond, he's thinking about leaving the north for good to protect his family. ""Yes, sadly but yes. I won't put my children in a position where they are harmed,"" he says. Bergman too says there's only one thing that will make him feel safe returning home. He wants a full-scale war that will destroy Hezbollah, as Israel says it is now trying to do to Hamas with its military operations in Gaza. ""We will fight very hard Hezbollah. That's the only option — it's not a good option but if we want to go home and feel that there's nobody near the border that can threaten us or our children, that's the only solution. "" Many of the Israelis in the north interviewed by NPR voiced impatience with their government for not already striking harder against Hezbollah. Others predicted that as soon as the fight with Hamas is over in the south, Israel's military will turn its attention here to the Lebanese border.

151,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/12/1218692478/gaza-hospital-israel-hamas-khan-younis,"KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — The front line of Israel's offensive on Gaza runs through the middle of the territory's second-largest city, with Israeli troops pushing in from the east as people flee the fighting and swamp the city's few hospitals. In the rubble-strewn streets of Khan Younis, people are piling belongings into cars, trucks and donkey carts to escape Israel's devastating bombardment of the Palestinian territory. As heavy fighting continued Monday close to the city's main hospital, Nasser Medical Complex, Israeli security chiefs paid a rare visit to the city, where the Israeli military says it is concentrated on dismantling Hamas targets, including tunnels that run under hospitals. Israel launched its air-and-ground offensive in Gaza following a surprise attack on Oct. 7 by Hamas militants that killed 1,200 people, Israel says. Since then, more than 18,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza health ministry. The military operation has  displaced about 85% of Gaza's 2. 3 million people, according to the United Nations. On Tuesday, the U. N. World Food Programme (WFP) repeated a dire warning that has grown louder among humanitarian groups and agencies in recent weeks, saying that the situation in Gaza is on the ""brink of collapse. "" ""WFP calls for an immediate ceasefire and the opening of all border crossings to provide relief and put an end to the suffering,"" the U. N. agency said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). Israel says just over 100 of its soldiers have been killed and around 600 wounded since the start of the ground assault. Israeli media, citing data released by Israel's military, say that so far, 13 soldiers have been killed in friendly fire incidents and another seven in ""operational accidents. ""At Nasser Medical Complex in central Khan Younis, what head ICU nurse Dr. Samer Mansour describes can hardly be called a functioning hospital — no syringes, no gauze, no medications. There is not enough water and electricity from generators is spotty, at best, he says. There are four patients for each of the hospital's 300 beds, resulting in many patients being forced to lie in the corridors. Mansour estimates that 20,000 others are using the hospital grounds simply as shelter from the fighting. In the hospital's ICU, Mansour says he's afraid to leave patients on mechanical ventilator support. ""I can't leave because they will die,"" he says. Dr. Mohammad Zaqout, the director of hospitals at the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza, tells NPR that dozens of doctors at Nasser have fled. They fear Israeli troops could occupy the hospital, as happened earlier at the Al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza, he said. Mansour says that during last month's brief cease-fire, Nasser began receiving patients from Al-Shifa and the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, where the opening phase of the Israeli drive to eradicate Hamas was focused. Since the temporary truce ended nearly two weeks ago, things have only gotten worse, Mansour says. ""We have a catastrophic situation here,"" he says. ""We have very few doctors,  nurses and administrators. ""A woman in one of Nasser's corridors who identified herself only as Um Hussam, said that the number of displaced people in Khan Younis increased after the cease-fire ended. She said people were told to go to safe areas, but ""they were bombed in these so-called safe places. """"So the talk that these areas were safe places and you can go to them wasn't true,"" she says. ""Why don't they go and fight against the resistance fighters? Why target us, women and innocent children?"" she says. ""Do they think the fighters tell us when they come and go? We are just raising children, and then you come and destroy a building with women and children in it. What is their fault?""Meanwhile, Israel's defense chief, Yoav Gallant, said at a news conference on Monday that Hamas fighters in Gaza's north had been nearly wiped out, with hundreds surrendering to Israeli forces.  ""We have encircled the last strongholds of Hamas in Jabalia and Shujaiya, the battalions that were considered invincible, that prepared for years to fight us, are on the verge of being dismantled,"" Gallant said. In Khan Younis, Israel's military says that in the last few days it has parachuted seven tons of water to soldiers engaged in combat operations there. It released a a video of what it says is the first operational use of an advanced ""guided supply"" system ""that enables parachuting equipment to ground forces using precise navigational capabilities.

152,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/12/1218388766/egypt-israel-gaza-palestinians-hamas,"TEL AVIV, Israel — As the bombardment of Gaza intensifies, forcing Palestinians to flee their homes, Israel's military is directing them to the territory's southernmost Rafah governorate. There, hemmed in by Israeli forces and the Mediterranean Sea, Palestinians seemingly have only one place to go — across the border into Egypt's Sinai Desert. Egypt has rejected allowing an influx from Gaza, citing concerns about the displacement of Palestinians and regional security issues. But it's an option that Israel has apparently considered. A ""concept paper"" drafted by Israeli intelligence shortly after the start of the war in October proposes moving Palestinians in the Gaza Strip to tent encampments in northern Sinai and then building permanent cities. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has said the report is only a hypothetical exercise. According to Gaza's Health Ministry, more than 17,000 people have been killed since Israel's air and ground assault began. It came in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people, Israel says. Some 85% of Gaza's 2. 3 million people have been internally displaced since the start of the war, according to the United Nations. U. N. Secretary-General António Guterres, who last week sought a Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire, which failed because of a U. S. veto, warned on Sunday that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is in free fall. ""I expect public order to completely break down soon, and an even worse situation could unfold, including epidemic diseases and increased pressure for mass displacement into Egypt,"" Guterres said at an international conference in Qatar. Despite telling Palestinians to move south, Israel has repeatedly carried out airstrikes in the Rafah area. For Egypt, the crisis in Gaza comes as its authoritarian president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, is facing voters in an election that concludes Tuesday. Although Sisi faces no credible opponent and is all but certain to win, public opinion still matters. Despite an official ban on public protests, Egyptians have turned out in numbers to rally in support of Palestinians in Gaza. Sisi himself said in October that he rejects Palestinians being displaced, saying it could forever undermine the push for Palestinian statehood. ""The Palestinian cause is the mother of all causes and has a significant impact on security and stability,"" he said. It's a position popular with many Egyptians and others in the Arab world, who are sympathetic to the plight of Palestinians in Israel. Egypt, which already hosts 9 million refugees, according to U. N. figures, has repeatedly insisted an exodus of besieged Palestinians will not be allowed. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry has called the prospect ""totally unacceptable. ""Shoukry, speaking last week to the Washington, D. C. -based Atlantic Council, noted the ""unprecedented level of human suffering"" in Gaza. He said transferring Gazans to Egyptian territory would be a violation of international humanitarian law and ""an effort to liquidate the Palestinian cause. ""Imad Harb, director of research and analysis at the Arab Center Washington DC, says Sisi's standing with ordinary Egyptians ""has actually been bolstered by the position that he has taken in the war. ""There's another motive in the mix, says Uzi Rabi, director of the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies in Tel Aviv. Security concerns for Egypt are paramount. Sisi's rivals in the Muslim Brotherhood briefly led Egypt before he took power around a decade ago, and in the 1980s Hamas emerged as an offshoot of the group. Islamists still pose a threat to Sisi's rule, and Egypt is also battling Islamist insurgents in Sinai, just across the Gaza border. ""What you get in Sinai is a splinter of ISIS,"" Rabi says, referring to the Islamic State militant group. He describes those operating in Sinai as ""a cocktail of Islamic radicalism, terrorism . . . arms smuggling and all that stuff. ""The fear for some is that militants may escape into Egypt from Gaza. And if Hamas were to launch attacks on Israel from Sinai, then the concern becomes that Israel could retaliate with strikes inside Egypt. Timothy Kaldas, deputy director of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, thinks Hamas may not be Egypt's primary concern. ""There are other militant groups in Gaza,"" such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad, he says. Even if one militant group disappears, ""it doesn't mean militancy is going to go away,"" Kaldas says. He doubts Israel can eradicate Hamas, but even if that happened, ""there's certainly a risk that other groups will sprout in its place. ""There's also the history of conflict. Egypt has fought wars with Israel in the past. And Egypt administered the Gaza Strip for two decades until the 1967 Six-Day War, when the Israeli military captured the territory. There would also be no guarantee that Palestinians who fled would ever be able to return to Gaza, Harb says. In 1948, in the first Arab-Israeli war that followed the formation of Israel as a state, and again in 1967, Palestinians were ""kicked out"" of their homes, ""never to return,"" he says. ""If they do go to Sinai, how is the regime going to accommodate them there? And [is] there any ironclad commitment that they would return to Gaza, given that the Gaza Strip . . . has already been destroyed?"" Harb says. So far, there doesn't appear to be any specific plan to make this happen, Kaldas says. ""Certainly, I think that there are people within the Israeli government that hope to still precipitate enough of a crisis to make it happen. ""Meanwhile, Cairo is in a deepening debt crisis and in need of external financing through the next fiscal year of at least $41. 5 billion, according to a report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. That could be used as leverage, according to Rabi. He says there's talk in Arab media that Egypt might concede to helping Palestinians in Gaza resettle in a third country, ""as long as there are destinations that would say in advance that they are ready and willing to absorb [Palestinians] into their territory. """"I don't know if it could be Qatar or Saudi Arabia or whatever, but not to Egypt,"" he says. But such a move would call into question the entire legitimacy of Palestinian self-rule, experts say. As a result, Jordanian King Abdullah II has echoed a phrase also used by Egypt and the leadership of the Palestinian Authority. Jordan already has a large Palestinian population. Accepting Palestinian refugees, they say, is a ""red line"" they won't cross. As for Palestinians, despite everything that has happened, many don't want to leave, according to Kaldas. ""They know that the odds that the Israelis would let them back home after the fighting ends [are] . . . unlikely. """,npr_articles/article_152.txt,npr_results/article_152.txt.json
153,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/11/1218145466/israel-hamas-war-shia-sunni-iran-backed-militants,"BEIRUT — The Gaza war has pushed together powerful Iran-backed Shia Muslim paramilitaries with militant Sunni factions in what appears to be closer cooperation between groups that differ in religious ideology but are united by opposition to Israel and the United States. Hamas, which launched the attacks on Israel two months ago that sparked the war, is a primarily Sunni Muslim Palestinian movement. The group — whose name is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement — is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, the powerful Islamist movement that was founded in Egypt in the 1920s. Hamas itself was founded in 1987 by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a Palestinian cleric who was living in Gaza. Yassin was assassinated by Israel in 2004. The group he founded won elections in Gaza two years later and the following year seized control from the Palestinian Authority. Egypt and Israel responded by blockading Gaza. Although Palestinians include Shia Muslims, Christians, Druze and other denominations, the vast majority are Sunni Muslims. Lebanese Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim movement, emerged during the country's civil war after Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Its fighters have been trained and funded partly by Iran, which uses armed proxy groups to extend its power in the region. Apart from Hamas, it poses the biggest challenge to Israel. Hezbollah and Israeli forces have attacked each other across the Lebanese-Israeli border since the war in Gaza began in October. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are designated terrorist organizations by Israel, the United States, the European Union and others. ""I think in the recent events there is definitely more communication between these groups,"" says Sajad Jiyad, a Baghdad-based analyst with The Century Foundation think tank. Jiyad and other analysts pointed to recent meetings between Hamas and Hezbollah officials and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's increasing engagement with both Shia and Sunni groups outside Lebanon. Iran's state news agency confirmed that Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi held phone talks with leaders of Hamas and another Gaza-based armed group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the day after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack. IRNA said Raisi told Ziyad al-Naklhalah, head of Palestine Islamic Jihad, that God had promised the liberation of Palestine. Jiyad also said Iranian weapons routed through Iranian proxies in Lebanon and Iraq to militant Palestinian groups also showed coordination before the war in Gaza began. Hamas' former leader, Khaled Mishaal, told the Saudi news channel al-Arabiya that while Hezbollah attacks on Israel across the Lebanese border were useful, the fight demanded much more. ""We shouldn't just focus on Lebanon and Hezbollah. Let's look at other countries,"" he said, citing Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Egypt and Jordan have signed peace treaties with Israel that have provided those Arab countries with critical economic support from the United States and Europe. While the Egyptian and Jordanian governments are unlikely to take action against Israel, public anger in their countries as Israel flattens parts of Gaza and the civilian death toll mounts raises the risk of instability. Iran-backed groups dubbed by Iran as ""the axis of resistance"" include Hezbollah in Lebanon, Houthis in Yemen and paramilitary groups in Iraq and Syria. Many of those groups flourished in Iraq after the U. S. invasion in 2003, to the point where Iran-backed militias answering to Tehran are now an integral part of Iraqi security forces. Increased attacks, most by Iran-backed forces, on U. S. targets in Iraq and Syria since the Israel-Hamas war started have prompted retaliatory U. S. airstrikes in both countries. Shia and Sunni branches of Islam split over disagreements over who should rightfully succeed the Prophet Muhammad after his death 13 centuries ago. Religious divisions have helped fuel civil war in countries including Lebanon and Iraq in the past, although sectarianism has often taken second place to armed struggles over power and money. Increased coordination both within militant Shia and Sunni groups and between each other could represent a more potent threat to both Israel and the United States. The Shia-Sunni split in Islam has also played a role in the regional power struggle between Iran, a Shia Muslim theocracy, and Saudi Arabia, which views itself as the leading Sunni Muslim power. Earlier this year, China brokered a historic agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia in which the two rivals agreed to resume diplomatic relations. Since the U. S. killing of Iranian commander Qassim Soleimani in a Baghdad drone strike in 2020, analysts say Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has played more of a coordinating role in bringing together divided Shia armed groups and reaching out to Sunni ones — a role at which the Iranian general excelled. On the Lebanese side of the 30-foot concrete wall built by Israel and stretching for miles along the border of the two countries, an image of Soleimani has prominent pride of place among figures locals deem heroes of the Palestinian and Lebanese resistance. ""Certainly there has been more planning, meetings and discussion taking place with Hezbollah as a central node in the axis,"" says Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East program at Chatham House research center. She says many militant groups have mostly domestic aims in the countries where they operate and there is not yet a transnational axis of militant organization. ""There's no joint training, there's no sort of axis of resistance reunion every year in Tehran or Beirut,"" Vakil says. ""The groups are really quite dispersed and very interested in their local context. ""Sajad says he believes militant groups, willing to help Hamas but reluctant to enter all-out war with Israel, were waiting. ""I don't think Hamas has requested that sort of wider escalation or direct support but that potential is there,"" he says. ""It really depends on how the war in Gaza proceeds.

154,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/09/1218407156/israel-tank-ammunition-sale-gaza-congress-state-department,"WASHINGTON  — Going around Congress, the Biden administration said Saturday it has approved the emergency sale to Israel of nearly 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition worth more than $106 million as Israel intensifies its military operations in the southern Gaza Strip. The move comes as President Joe Biden's request for a nearly $106 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other national security is languishing in Congress, caught up in a debate over U. S. immigration policy and border security. Some Democratic lawmakers have spoken of making the proposed $14. 3 billion in American assistance to its Mideast ally contingent on concrete steps by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to reduce civilian casualties in Gaza during the war with Hamas. The State Department said it had notified Congress of the sale late Friday after Secretary of State Antony Blinken determined ""an emergency exists that requires the immediate sale"" of the munitions in the U. S. national security interest. That means the purchase will bypass the congressional review requirement for foreign military sales. Such determinations are rare, but not unprecedented, when administrations see an urgent need for weapons to be delivered without waiting for lawmakers' approval. ""The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to U. S. national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability. This proposed sale is consistent with those objectives,"" the department said in a statement. ""Israel will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense. ""The sale is worth $106. 5 million and includes 13,981 120 mm High Explosive Anti-Tank Multi-Purpose with Tracer tank cartridges as well as U. S. support, engineering and logistics. The materiel will come from Army inventory. Bypassing Congress with emergency determinations for arms sales is an unusual step that has in the past met resistance from lawmakers, who normally have a period of time to weigh on proposed weapons transfers and, in some cases, block them. In May, 2019, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an emergency determination for an $8. 1 billion sales of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan after it became clear that the Trump administration would have trouble overcoming lawmakers' concerns about the Saudi- UAE-led war in Yemen. Pompeo came under heavy criticism for the move, which some believed may have violated the law because many of the weapons involved had yet to be built and could not be delivered urgently. But he was cleared of any wrongdoing after an internal investigation. At least four administrations have used the authority since 1979. President George H. W. Bush's administration used it during the Gulf War to get arms quickly to Saudi Arabia.",npr_articles/article_154.txt,npr_results/article_154.txt.json
155,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/09/1218384968/mosque-gaza-omari-israel-hamas-war,"TEL AVIV, Israel — The Omari Mosque, Gaza's most iconic landmark and oldest mosque stretching back centuries, has been largely destroyed in an Israeli strike, Gaza City officials and eyewitnesses say. An Israeli official, who spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity to offer a preliminary assessment, confirmed the strike and said the mosque grounds contained a tunnel shaft used by militants, and that Hamas fighters from the elite Nukhba battalion had regularly used the mosque for cover. Destroyed by earthquakes and conquests, and rebuilt many times over history, the mosque had a storied history incorporating many religious traditions. NPR visited the mosque in 2019 on a tour of Gaza's cultural landmarks with a local guide. Now Gaza's central mosque, with its blue-carpeted floors and stained glass windows, is unrecognizable. Images published Friday by a local Gaza news site and the Gaza City municipality show the mosque's roof demolished and the main hall covered in rubble, with some arched walls and a damaged, but still intact, minaret. Israel says its aim is to eliminate Hamas in Gaza so it doesn't carry out another attack like its Oct. 7 assault that killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel. The military's resulting bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 17,000 people, Gaza health officials say, and rendered much of Gaza's historic core a wasteland. The Omari Mosque was originally a 5th century Byzantine church that was built over a more ancient temple. It was converted into a mosque in the 7th century, then a Crusader church in the 11th century, and back to a mosque in the 13th century. The architectural elements of the Crusader church were still apparent in the modern-day mosque, and an etching of a Jewish menorah on a mosque column, believed to have been originally part of an ancient synagogue, was once documented, and was destroyed in recent decades. The Israeli military on Friday and Saturday called on residents of the neighborhood near the mosque to leave the area to escape the fighting, but many have stayed. During a lull in combat between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters on Friday, Mustafa Shahawani, 22, ventured out with a group of residents who live near the mosque to survey the damage to the neighborhood. He found the traditional gold market, for buying and selling gold, destroyed, and was shocked when he came upon the mosque next door. ""The mosque is now a hole,"" he told NPR on a patchy cellphone line. ""This is where we held holiday prayers, Ramadan prayers. All our memories were there. ""He stayed for just a moment and rushed back home, as active fighting resumed. Most residents of Gaza City fled weeks ago as Israeli troops invaded, but tens of thousands are estimated to have remained there and in the rest of north Gaza, including Shahawani. He doesn't think there's anywhere safer in Gaza to go. An unemployed university graduate who studied accounting, he is sheltering in his home with his grandmother, who is in her 80s. ""She cries every day,"" he said. During a weeklong cease-fire, he was able to walk through parts of Gaza City. He described seeing vast destruction; nearly every home was hit. He saw many bodies in the streets. He cannot stop thinking about the bodies of a woman and child he saw on his walk. He walked along the beachfront, and discovered the now-destroyed Deira Hotel, a Gaza landmark where he used to spend evenings with friends. The nearby Roots Hotel, a hangout for locals and foreign visitors, was also hit, he said. Since the cease-fire collapsed on Dec. 1, fighting near his house has intensified and he has barely left home. He and his grandmother drink one cup of water and eat one meal of rice a day. He is craving cheese. It's been a month and a half since he took a shower. ""There is no hope in life. We saw horrible things, and just want to live in peace,"" Shahawani said. ""It's not necessary for kids and women to die. ""Residents had been burying their dead in the yard next to his house. They ran out of space a few days ago, he said.

156,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/09/1217767373/gaza-humanitarian-aid-refugees-war-israel-hamas,"TEL AVIV, Israel — International aid groups are periodically called upon to provide food, water, medicine and other vital supplies to people caught in war zones. But getting that critical aid to a population on the run and under fire presents enormous challenges, humanitarian groups say, and the situation in Gaza is proving particularly difficult. ""We are being slammed left, right and center,"" says Juliette Touma, a spokesperson for UNRWA, the United Nations relief agency that aids Palestinians. ""This is very different than any other conflict or war we've had to manage,"" Touma says, adding that it is the largest humanitarian response operation in UNRWA's nearly 75-year history. According to Gaza's Health Ministry, at least 17,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 46,000 wounded in Israel's air and ground campaign. It came in response to the surprise Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people, Israel says. U. N. agencies and organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Palestine Red Crescent Society and Doctors Without Borders say they are struggling to meet the needs of Gaza's 2. 3 million people, 85% of whom have been displaced by the fighting. Paul Spiegel, director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, is a physician and epidemiologist who spent decades working in such war-torn countries as Afghanistan and Ukraine. He says that in Gaza, ""there are many unique aspects to it, which makes it so difficult. ""Here's a look at some of those obstacles:The war has shut down all but one entry point into Gaza, with a crossing at Rafah, along the border with Egypt, now the single way in for convoys delivering aid. During a weeklong pause in the fighting, about 200 aid trucks per day were crossing at Rafah, far short of what aid experts said was needed. However, since the fighting resumed, the number of vehicles with relief supplies making it through has fallen. Spiegel, who is currently in Cairo working with international aid groups, says very few vehicles are getting through — ""maybe 100 a day, sometimes none. ""Since the end of the cease-fire on Dec. 1, ""we've seen a significant decrease in the flow of humanitarian assistance coming into Gaza,"" Touma says. She says the reduced aid getting to Palestinians in Gaza is because of the heavy fighting, which means distribution is hampered in conjunction with the smaller convoys that are not enough to replenish aid stocks. Since the outbreak of the war, Israel has restricted shipments of fuel that it says could fall into the hands of Hamas. Without fuel, generators needed for electricity can't operate — a fact that has crippled Gaza's health system. Ahmad Mohammad Shannan, from Jabalia in Gaza's north, told NPR that to escape the fighting in the north in the war's early weeks, he went south to Khan Younis, Gaza's second-largest city. When that city became the focus of fighting in recent days, Shannan came to Rafah. ""They brought us here where there is no food or drink,"" he says. ""They distribute food, but it's not enough. ""Before the war, UNRWA, which ran dozens of schools in Gaza, had planned for 50 shelters to temporarily house 150,000 people in case of conflict, Touma says. Now, more than half of Gaza's total population, 1. 2 million people, is at 150 shelters run by the agency. And most of the people are crammed into about one-quarter of the territory, less than 40 square miles, Touma says. ""So our teams are stretched to the limit,"" she says. ""Our capacities are stretched. We are overwhelmed. This is seven or eight times more [people] than we have planned for and three times as many facilities. ""Nufuz Shaban el Ghoof, in Rafah after arriving from the Khan Younis area, told NPR that he was told to move south because of the intensity of the shelling. In Khan Younis, he, his children and his grandchildren had been staying in a school. Now he's living in a tent in Rafah. He says people are becoming desperate enough to resort to theft, and he complains about the crowded circumstances. ""People steal from starvation,"" Ghoof says. It's so crowded where he's staying that ""you cannot walk from the crowdedness of the tents. ""With much of Gaza's population now crammed into the southernmost one-quarter of the territory, there's also a ""lack of humanitarian space,"" says Spiegel. It's a situation made worse by Israel's relentless bombardment, which has laid waste to whole sections of Gaza's urban centers, he says. As combat operations have increased pressure on civilians, Israel's military has declared ""safe zones"" where it says people can seek refuge from the fighting. But international aid groups say these zones are inadequate. Instead, the fighting has caused ""a constant displacement [of people] with no safe zones,"" Spiegel says. ""And probably the most unique component is that there is no escape valve. ""With fighting to the north, Israel to the east, the Mediterranean Sea to the west and Egypt's closed border with Gaza in the south, people have nowhere to go, Spiegel says. ""You've got this massive fighting and massive bombardment in a small contained area, and there's just no space for people to move and flee and for the humanitarian organizations to respond,"" he says. In two incidents last month, Doctors Without Borders came under direct Israeli fire twice within a matter of days, the head of operations for the group, Michel Lacharité, says. On Nov. 18, personnel displaying the MSF logo — the abbreviation for the group's French name — on vehicles' hoods, backs and doors ""came face-to-face with an Israeli tank, and a soldier shot at them,"" Lacharité says. Israel's military has not addressed the MSF attacks directly but has said that it ""recognizes the importance of the special protections given to medical teams under international humanitarian law and takes action to prevent harm to them.

The Security Council vote on the resolution, backed by Arab states, had 13 in favor and one — the U. S. — against, while the United Kingdom abstained. After the vote, the U. S. deputy representative to the U. N. , Robert Wood, said the resolution was rushed and ignored U. S. diplomatic efforts to get more aid into Gaza and free hostages taken by Hamas militants in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. ""We propose language . . . that would have reinforced the life-saving diplomacy we have undertaken since Oct. 7, increased opportunities for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza, encourage the release of hostages and the resumption of humanitarian pauses and laid a foundation for a durable peace,"" Wood said. ""Unfortunately, nearly all of our recommendations were ignored. ""Several foreign ministers of Arab countries that have been pushing for a cease-fire met U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington shortly after the U. S. veto. While Blinken's aides say he wanted to talk about the future of Gaza, once Israel defeats Hamas, Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, rejected that approach. ""Today's failure to support the call for a humanitarian cease-fire is an endorsement of further killing of Palestinians, further violations of international law, further commitment of war crimes,"" Safadi said. ""Israel is basically doing whatever it wants, in defiance even of its allies, creating a horrific situation in Gaza, and then wants us to come in and clean the mess. We will not do that. ""He was joined by the foreign ministers of Qatar, Egypt and Saudi Arabia in calling for a cease-fire in Gaza. Wood said the resolution's authors declined to condemn Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that killed 1,200 people, including women, children and elderly. In response to the Hamas attack, Israel's two-month military campaign has killed more than 17,400 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, most of them women and children, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and combatant casualties in its figures. Wood added that the draft also ""failed to acknowledge that Israel has the right to defend itself against terrorism. ""Israeli Ambassador to the U. S. Gilad Erdan thanked the U. S.

In the frightening early hours of the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, some museums in Israel worked quickly to remove priceless artifacts and art from their walls into safe bunkers in the basements of institutions like the Israel Museum in Jerusalem and the Tel Aviv Art Museum. Many staffers, who dedicate their lives to preserving cultural artifacts, put aside their own fears and concern for their families and set out to work as word of the brutality of the Hamas attack spread.

""Those are really the cultural treasures of the state and all the world,"" she said of the value behind protecting pieces from artists like Marc Chagall, Georgia O'Keeffe and Pablo Picasso.  But like so many things, the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas poses a different kind of threat for Palestinians and their work to protect cultural landmarks and museums.  More than 1,200 people were killed in the attack by Hamas on Israel on Oct. 7 and more than 240 people were kidnapped. The air-and-ground assault on Gaza launched by Israel in response to the attack has displaced millions of Palestinians and killed more than 16,000 people, according to Gaza health officials.  In Gaza, there was virtually no option to move valuable artifacts into secure bunkers or to take action to protect ancient landmarks. Israel's military has turned many areas of Gaza into rubble and forced millions of people to evacuate south. Many people have only been able to grab a few items from their homes before fleeing.  ""From what we've seen until now, it's catastrophic,"" said Mamdouh Froukh, a curator at the Yasser Arafat Museum in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, of the losses to the region's ancient cultural heritage. ""This is the worst destruction of Palestinian history. ""  More than 100 cultural landmarks in Gaza have suffered serious damage from the Israeli military's operations there, according to a recent survey by the group Heritage for Peace. They include the Great Omari Mosque and the Church of Saint Porphyrius, thought to be the third oldest church in the world.  In Gaza, Froukh said, ""We are afraid that everything is lost. ""A spokesperson for the Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment. But the military has defended its bombing by saying its goal is to save hostages and destroy Hamas, whose militants they maintain are hiding in extensive tunnels underground in Gaza. Hagit Maoz was first awoken by Israel's bomb sirens early on the morning on Saturday, Oct. 7.  ""We didn't understand yet how serious it was,"" she said. Given the number of bomb sirens in a short amount of time and the sound of rockets, she said she realized this event was far more significant.  Maoz had two sons at home with her that day. As news of the Hamas attack was slowly shared by confused and scared Israelis, like Maoz, she received word that she had to report to work at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.  That's where Maoz serves as the curator of the Shrine of the Book and is in charge of the care and curation of the Dead Sea Scrolls, ancient religious manuscripts dating back to the third century BCE.  The Shrine of the Book is the cave-like repository that houses the first seven scrolls of the manuscripts. As the bomb sirens rang out across the country throughout the day and the extent of the attacks by Hamas remained unclear for hours, Maoz left the safety of her home to go to the museum with the goal of removing the multiple pieces of the Dead Sea Scrolls from their display into a secure vault.  ""We can't take the risk that this might be damaged. We are the custodians,"" she said. The last time the Israel Museum removed the Dead Sea Scrolls from display was during the Iraq War.  Maoz only had the museum's deputy chief security officer to assist her in this monumental task. On top of mind for the two were their families: The security officer's daughter was called up to the military that very morning and Maoz's sons hid at home.  On that Saturday, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art also worked to remove its Alberto Giacometti show as the pieces by the Swiss sculptor and painter were particularly delicate and valuable, according to Coen-Uzzielli, the museum's director. Shortly thereafter, the institution made the tough decision to remove many of its pieces from the modern art wing. Still, more than nine weeks later many walls of the of Modern Art hall remain empty, while other large pieces remain covered in protective cardboard. The museum includes works that survived major wars and the Holocaust and has significant meaning for the state of Israel, she said. Like many institutions around the world, history and art museums have a so-called ""war list"" of items curators would pull from displays if there was a threat to the building. ""It's the most valuable, most precious artworks, or the most important artifacts that we are holding in the museum,"" said Nurith Goshen, curator of The Feast exhibition at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.  On the weekend of Oct. 7, she also came into the museum to remove a number of historic artifacts from her wing of the museum that were included on this list.  ""This is monumental. This is what we do. This is our job. If the Shrine of the Book or one of these really symbolic artifacts is hurt, it's bigger than all of us,"" Goshen said.  Some 18 or so miles from the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, in Ramallah, in the West Bank, the Yasser Arafat Museum remains open, with just a handful of visitors a day walking through its exhibits. In better times, the museum has tens of thousands of visitors, many of them foreigners, each year.  The museum decided to keep each of its artifacts from Arafat — like his glasses, notebooks and clothes — still up and hanging during the war, in a break with the response by the museums in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.  Froukh said of the museum's reasoning, ""There is no safe place in Palestine for the museum objects and their history. ""  There was a debate among curators before the museum was created over whether it was a good idea to have this building in the first place. ""Because Palestine is a conflict area"" and there is always the potential of an outbreak of violence that could threaten the museum and its valuable items, Froukh said.   Keeping that at the top of mind, Froukh said the museum's leaders took 3D photos and digitized the objects it shows in the museum to preserve them for the future and to reproduce them if need be.  The museum covers the contemporary history of Palestinians and the start of the conflict between Palestinians and the Israeli state, Froukh said. Now, in the midst of this current war, this history is more important than ever to share with visitors, he said.  ""The origin of the old problem is explained in this museum. We explained how the beginning of the conflict started, which is not the seventh of October, it's in the beginning of the 20th century,"" he said.  The major focus of the museum is, of course, Arafat. The Palestinian political leader, who was adored by some and reviled by others, led the Palestinian Liberation Organization to sign the 1993  Oslo Accord, in which Israelis and Palestinian agreed to recognize the other's right to exist. He and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace for this agreement in 1994, though their talks to secure a lasting peace eventually fell apart.  The museum still displays Arafat's Nobel Prize.  In 2002, Arafat was confined to his presidential compound in Ramallah, where the museum now sits. As part of its permanent exhibition, the museum preserves Arafat's bunker where he spent more than three years under siege by the Israeli government.  For some time, the Arafat Museum had plans to open a second, smaller location in Gaza in the political leader's old house, Froukh said.  When NPR last spoke to Froukh a month ago, it was unclear if that building was still standing.  For Gaza, there is no way to keep precious historic and cultural items safe amid the ongoing Israeli bombardment of the territory, according to Froukh.  Gaza's Rafah Museum that showed the region's multi-layered history, was completely destroyed in Israeli airstrikes.  ""There were priceless items from coins, precious stones, copper plates, clothes,"" Rafah Museum director Suhaila Shaheen, said in Arabic in a recent video interview posted on the museum's Facebook page.  Beyond physical buildings and cultural institutions, there is evidence that ancient landmarks buried in Gaza are lost forever, according to Eyal Weizman, the founder and director of Forensic Architecture at Goldsmiths, University of London.  Forensic Architecture, is a research agency that investigates human rights violations. Last year, the group issued a report revealing how Israeli operations in Gaza threatened a valuable archaeological site where researchers found evidence of Roman and Hellenistic-era structures.  The threat has reached colossal proportions throughout Gaza with Israel's latest military incursion, Weizman said.  As early as Oct. 8, one day after the Hamas attack in Israel, Weizman said researchers saw evidence of three large craters from Israeli rockets — indicating major damage to an archaeological site Forensic Architecture previously studied.  The impact for Palestinians is bigger than just losing physical landmarks, Weizman said.  ""To erase the past is to erase their culture,"" he said.  And further, Gaza and historic Palestine has been inhabited by various people, cultures and religions for thousands of years, he said.  He said to see that destroyed, ""is what makes it all the more heartbreaking. """,npr_articles/article_158.txt,npr_results/article_158.txt.json

Speaking at a ceremony to light the National Menorah, Emhoff cited the testimony as an example of why many Jews have felt ""feeling unmoored and afraid"" because of backlash to Israel's military response in Gaza to the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. The presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania have been criticized for failing to say whether students calling for genocide would be disciplined. Liz Magill, the president of UPenn, said the issue would be ""context-dependent. "" She has since apologized. ""Seeing the presidents of some of our most elite universities literally unable to denounce calling for the genocide of Jews as antisemitic — that lack of moral clarity is simply unacceptable,"" Emhoff said. ""Let me be clear. When Jews are targeted because of their beliefs or identity, and when Israel is singled out because of anti-Jewish hatred, that is antisemitism. And it must be condemned and condemned unequivocally and without context,"" he said. Since the Oct. 7 attacks, President Biden has pronounced unequivocal support for Israel while expressing concerns about civilian deaths in Gaza. But polls show a majority of Democratic voters feel like Israel's response has gone too far. Vice President Harris said on Saturday that Israel needed to do more to protect civilians in Gaza. ""Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering and the images and videos coming from Gaza are devastating,"" she said. Emhoff — who is the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president — has led White House efforts on combating antisemitism, and earlier this year he helped unveil a plan to boost safety and security for Jewish communities. At the National Menorah lighting ceremony, he said that Hanukkah was a time to ""live out the legacy of the generations of ancestors who came before us"" and ""rededicate ourselves to embracing our faith and practicing our traditions. ""We cannot live in fear or be afraid. We must always live openly and proudly as Jews,"" he said. ",npr_articles/article_159.txt,npr_results/article_159.txt.json
160,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/07/1217855847/reuters-journalist-death-issam-abdallah-israel,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — Investigations conducted by two news organizations and two human rights groups have concluded an Israeli tank round killed a Reuters video journalist near the Lebanese border in October and that Israeli forces either knew or should have known they were targeting journalists. The reports are the first public investigative findings of any killing of a journalist in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas — a conflict that has been one of the deadliest for media in recent history. The Committee to Protect Journalists has confirmed the death of at least 63 journalists and media workers since the Gaza war began. They include 56 Palestinians, four Israelis and three Lebanese journalists. The Israeli military said after the attack that it was investigating the incident. It has not yet issued any findings. Israeli military officials have said repeatedly that they do not target journalists. Lebanese video journalist Issam Abdallah, 37, was killed and a photographer for Agence France-Presse, Christina Assi, 28, was severely wounded in the Oct. 13 attack. At least five others were also wounded. The news teams were covering clashes along the border where Israel and the militia Hezbollah were trading fire. All were wearing protective vests and helmets — most clearly marked ""PRESS"" — during more than an hour in which they reported from the same location, according to the Reuters investigation. ""The Israeli military knew or should have known that they were civilians yet attacked them anyway in two separate strikes 37 seconds apart,"" Amnesty International said in a report released Thursday. A separate report released by Human Rights Watch echoed the findings by Amnesty, Reuters and AFP. Reuters said an Israeli helicopter had hovered overhead before the first strike. At least one of the press vehicles had tape spelling out ""TV"" on the roof. The reports released Thursday found no evidence of military targets near the journalists. Reuters said evidence of Israeli tank round shrapnel was found embedded in a vehicle and in body armor. Abdallah was killed instantly while Assi, who can be heard in a video screaming as a camera continued to roll after the attack, had her leg severed and is still in hospital. Reuters said it spoke to more than 30 government and security officials, forensics and weapons experts and others for its investigation. Reuters said the journalists were over half a mile from the border with Israel when they were attacked. Its report included a timeline including an image of live video of smoke rising from behind a hill being filmed by Abdallah. After 45 minutes of filming the camera focused on an Israeli outpost and tank firing into Lebanon. Less than 90 seconds later the first of two tank rounds fired from another hill hit the team, killing Abdullah. A second round 37 seconds later set a car used by Al Jazeera on fire. Two journalists from the Lebanese network Al Mayadeen were killed in another attack in Lebanon on Nov. 21 as they filmed near the border. Human rights officials said the multiple sources of video and other images from the attack on Abdallah and the other journalists made it possible to carry out unusually detailed analysis. That is not the case with most of the other attacks, either in Lebanon or in Gaza.",npr_articles/article_160.txt,npr_results/article_160.txt.json
161,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/07/1217758587/bernie-sanders-israel-aid-conditional,"The Senate voted 49 to 51 on Wednesday not to advance a bill that would provide billions of dollars to Ukraine and Israel, aid the White House says is essential for safeguarding democracy across the globe. Republicans made good on their threat to block consideration of the bill unless it included their preferred border security and immigration measures. They were joined by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats — and one of Congress' most prominent progressives.  Sanders voted no for a different reason, as he later explained in a statement: ""I do not believe that we should give the right-wing extremist Netanyahu government an additional $10. 1 billion dollars with no strings attached to continue their inhumane war against the Palestinian people. "" In floor remarks and a letter to Democrats earlier this week, Sanders said he agreed with many of the bill's provisions, including its support for humanitarian aid and Ukraine's right to defend itself. But he criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, noting that it has killed some 16,000 Palestinians and displaced another 1. 8 million from their homes in Gaza. He also pointed to Israeli settler violence and a growing Palestinian death toll in the West Bank. ""[Israel has] the right to go to war against Hamas, who committed an atrocious invasion of their country,"" Sanders told NPR's Morning Edition before Wednesday's vote. ""But they do not have the right to go to war against the Palestinian people. "" Sanders told Morning Edition's Michel Martin that he believes the only way the U. S. can tell Netanyahu that ""his military tactics are unacceptable"" is to not give him a blank check for the $10 billion that President Biden's security package seeks. He does support giving Israel $4 billion to replenish its Iron Dome, a decade-old network of radar detectors and missile launchers that intercepts incoming rockets. But he said further U. S. aid to Israel should come with conditions, adding that ""we cannot allow Israeli settlers to kill Palestinians on the West Bank"" and ""have got to also make it clear that the people of Gaza have a right to return and rebuild their homes. "" ""And maybe most importantly, we need a commitment from the Netanyahu government that there will be a two-state solution, that the Palestinians in the area have a right to their own homeland, to live with security and dignity,"" Sanders said. Unlike some of his fellow progressives, Sanders has not called for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. He told NPR that would be unrealistic, given Hamas' stated goal of destroying Israel. He says the changes needed in the region — now in its fifth war in 15 years — can only happen under new leadership in Gaza. While Israel aims to remove Hamas from power, it remains unclear who would step in to govern the territory.  ""You need new Palestinian leadership which pays attention to the needs of the Palestinian people and understands that Israel has a right to exist in a two-state situation,"" Sanders said. ""Not Hamas. "" The question of financial support for the militaries of Ukraine and Israel has both dominated and divided Capitol Hill in recent months. In October, Biden asked Congress for nearly $106 billion in funding for Israel, Ukraine, countering China and border security. The package included some $14 billion for Israel and more than $61 billion for Ukraine, which the Biden administration has repeatedly warned is running out of money to defend itself from Russia. House Republicans are increasingly opposed to sending more aid to Ukraine, though they did approve a $14. 5 billion military aid package for Israel (funded by cuts to the IRS) last month. The Democratic-controlled Senate said it would reject it, since it didn't include money for Ukraine, humanitarian aid in Gaza and other Biden administration priorities. Some Democrats have also raised questions about aid to Israel. A majority of Senate Democrats — as well as Sanders and independent Maine Sen. Angus King — wrote Biden a letter last month asking him to defend his request for aid and ensure that Israel will use U. S. military assistance in keeping with international law. After Wednesday's failed vote, Biden accused Republicans of ""playing chicken"" with the package by demanding ""partisan"" border policies, but also indicated he would be open to making compromises in order to get the bill passed. A bipartisan negotiating group working border policy in the Senate has been unable to overcome disagreements around asylum policy and other border security issues. Republicans have warned that they will not agree to a broader security bill without resolving the border issue. The president said Congress must approve funding for Ukraine before it goes on holiday recess late next week, or else it will be giving Russian president Vladimir Putin a gift. Sanders agrees, adding that he expected that Congress would need to go back to the drawing board and hopes it can ""do the best that we can . . . as soon as we can. "" ""I do think that it's absolutely imperative, that we need a spending bill right now, which makes it clear to Putin that the United States and the rest of the democratic world are supportive of Ukraine and other democracies,"" Sanders said. ""And I think humanitarian aid for Gaza and other parts of the world are desperately needed. "" Sanders also weighed in on a recent incident in his home state, in which a man shot three college students of Palestinian descent as they walked down the street in Burlington, speaking Arabic and wearing keffiyehs. All three survived, though one could face permanent paralysis in his legs due to a bullet lodged in his spine. The incident is being investigated as a hate crime. Sanders said the attack took place a mile from where he lives, calling it ""beyond belief and . . . unspeakable. "" He described the victims as ""really bright, lovely young men"" and said he had spoken to one of them recently. And he alluded to the broader context, in which reports of antisemitic, Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian incidents have skyrocketed in the wake of Oct. 7. ""That adds to all of the stress and ugliness that we're seeing taking place today,"" he said. ""It is a tough time for our country, to say the least. "" Sanders said in a democratic society, people have the right to disagree and participate in the political process. But they cannot, he said, translate their political views ""into hatred of an entire people. "" ""This country has gone through hundreds of years of bigotry and hatred,"" he added. ""We're trying to climb our way out of it. Let's not recede into tribalism and hatred just because of somebody's religion.

162,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/06/1217548417/israel-hamas-war-gaza-evacuation-map-messages,"TEL AVIV, Israel, and RAFAH, Gaza Strip — Nearly 1. 9 million Palestinians have fled their homes in the Gaza Strip in two months of war between Israel and Hamas, according to the United Nations. That's 85% of the population in the besieged enclave. They are being squeezed into smaller and smaller areas — as Israel urges Palestinians to escape its air-and-ground campaign, which has left more than 16,000 dead in Gaza, according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory. The U. S. demanded Israel declare safe zones to minimize civilian casualties from Israeli airstrikes in response to the surprise Oct. 7 Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. But Palestinians and international aid groups say those zones have been inadequate, and provide no guaranteed shelter to residents who escape. ""There is no 'safe' zone, the entire Gaza Strip has become one of the most dangerous places in the world,"" the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday. Israel's former attorney general, Avihai Mandelblit, says he thinks Israel's intention is to ensure civilians escape harm's way, despite the humanitarian crisis associated with urging mass evacuations to Gaza's south. ""I'm not saying it is nice being there, but the only thing that we try to do is to protect their lives. If they're going to stay in Khan Younis in such an intensity of combat, then lots of civilian lives will be lost. The most important thing — that they will not die,"" Mandelblit said, referring to Gaza's second-largest city where Israel's bombardment is focused now. Here is how Israel is notifying Gaza residents to flee — and a glimpse at the confusion, chaos and mass displacement that have resulted. As fighting resumed in Gaza last week after a temporary pause, the Israeli military issued a statement saying that it was ""providing information to residents of the Gaza Strip on movement for their safety in the next stage of the war. """"This divides the territory of the Gaza Strip . . . according to recognizable areas to enable the residents of Gaza to orient themselves and understand the instructions, and to evacuate from specific places for their safety, if required,"" the statement said. It then included a link to an Israeli army website in Arabic, featuring what Israel said was an interactive ""Evacuation Zone Map. ""The map came about as a result of the Biden administration's insistence that Israel minimize civilian casualties. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after a visit to Israel and the occupied West Bank, called on Israel to declare designated safe zones. But the map proved difficult to navigate on computers and the cellphones that most Palestinians use. Residents are asked to locate their neighborhood on a numbered grid, memorize its zone number and then ""track and follow the instructions of the [Israeli military] through various media outlets and obey them. ""Many residents in Gaza have little electricity or internet service, making it difficult to access the map. And those who have identified their zone according to the map have received mixed messages from both the Israeli military and other residents about whether their zone had been ordered to evacuate. Heba Usrof, who is from Khan Younis, where heavy fighting is taking place, tells NPR she looked at the map Israel provided and her zone was not listed for evacuation. ""My house was in zone 55. The last zone on the evacuation list was 54,"" says 29-year-old Usrof. ""Right after the truce was over, they hit right next to our house,"" Usrof says. ""They hit again the following day,"" she says. ""An Israeli soldier contacted our neighbor, instructing him to evacuate and tell everyone else to do the same. ""So Usrof moved south to Rafah, near the border with Egypt, where she says she's now sharing an apartment with 60 other people. The Israeli military said Hamas on Wednesday fired rockets toward Israel from rocket launchers near tents where civilians were sheltering in Rafah. ""The Hamas terrorist organization abuses the people of Gaza, utilizing them for its acts of terror. Hamas cynically embeds itself in civilian infrastructure, schools, residential areas, near United Nations facilities and even in humanitarian zones — using the civilians as a human shield,"" the military said in a statement. Israeli military Arabic spokesman Avichay Adraee has been posting information — along with videos aimed at persuading Palestinian viewers that Hamas was responsible for their suffering in the war — on X and Facebook since the war began, instructing civilians to flee. In this post on X on Tuesday, he said the military was operating in the Khan Younis area, and warned that a main north-south road was a combat zone. He said Israeli forces would suspend military activities in a neighborhood of Rafah until 2 p. m. Adraee's first announcement declaring a safe passage out of northern Gaza in early November was followed by another announcement the following day: The safe passage was rendered unsafe by Hamas gunfire, he said. Many Palestinians in Gaza say they have been following Adraee's Arabic-language announcements to try to make sense of Israel's changing directives. Israeli warplanes are also dropping flyers on neighborhoods, with directions to either flee or seek shelter. This isn't the first time residents of Gaza have experienced this kind of warning — in 2014, a similar tactic was used ahead of an Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip from the north and again in 2021. Mustafa, who only gave his first name because he was criticizing Hamas and feared retaliation, fled with his family and their belongings, from northern Gaza to Khan Younis 20 days ago, and then to Rafah on Tuesday. ""The Israelis told us to go south. We came here and found no place to go. We are all in the streets,"" he told NPR. ""Hamas should have secured the people, before doing this. They should have secured the people, and secured a place for the people. ""His young son held up a flier that had rained down on them earlier in the week. NPR translated from Arabic into English below:In the past few days, many cellphones in Rafah flashed with messages on their screens calling on people to evacuate from Khan Younis, as a ""dangerous battle"" was expected:The Israeli military says it has sent out approximately 15 million text messages, 12 million recorded cell phone messages and made more than 40,000 personal phone calls to residents of Gaza informing them when and where to evacuate. Internet and cellphone service have been cut repeatedly in Gaza since Oct. 7. Israel, which maintains a blockade on Gaza, has declined to answer NPR's request for comment on whether these communications cuts are deliberate. The robocalls have been confusing to residents. NPR spoke to several people who received calls from the Israeli military listing zones to evacuate that weren't their neighborhood. It wasn't clear whether they should leave. Many decided to leave anyway. NPR's Scott Neuman contributed reporting from Tel Aviv.

163,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/06/1217668564/israel-hamas-rape-sexual-violence-oct-7,"Editor's note: This story contains descriptions of graphic violence and sexual assault. The evidence of sexual violence on Oct. 7, Israel says, is overwhelming: Witness accounts of militants raping women; bodies of women discovered with their clothes removed; others shot through the head and the breast. For two months, Israeli officials have shared what they say proves Hamas fighters committed rape and other sexual assaults during the militant group's attack on Israel on Oct. 7 that left 1,200 Israelis dead, including more than 300 women. In recent weeks, Israel has accused major international groups, including the United Nations, of being slow to acknowledge and condemn the sexual violence, which Hamas has denied. ""I say to the women's rights organizations, to the human rights organizations, you've heard of the rape of Israeli women, horrible atrocities, sexual mutilation: Where the hell are you?"" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a press conference on Tuesday. This week, the pressure on United Nations officials rose after a remarkable session on Monday that included firsthand accounts from Israeli responders of injuries they saw on the bodies of victims. In response, U. N. officials have defended themselves and called for investigations into the allegations. In total, Israel says it has collected more than 1,500 eyewitness accounts of rape or evidence of sexual violence on Oct. 7. At the U. N. on Monday, testimony from three Israelis — a police officer, a first responder and a member of a morgue team that processed bodies — described and listed details of Israel's case. Simcha Greiniman, a volunteer rescue worker who helped collect bodies on Oct. 7, recounted discovering the body of a woman laying on the floor of her home. ""She was naked. She had nails and different objects in her female organs,"" he said, visibly emotional and hesitating between words. ""She was abused in a way we could not understand and could not deal with. "" In another home, Greiniman encountered the body of a woman leaning on a bed, naked from the waist down, shot through the back of her head, he said. ""I'm standing in front of you to make sure that you hear the voices of those women that cannot stand next to us now and be here to scream out what happened to them,"" Greiniman said. Yael Reichert, a superintendent of an Israeli national police unit, recounted testimony from survivors of the attacks and first responders who witnessed the immediate aftermath. A survivor from the Nova rave, a music festival where hundreds of young people were killed, told responders that ""everything was an apocalypse of corpses,"" with dead women who were missing clothes, Reichert said. A first responder at a kibbutz told Israeli officials that they encountered the body of a woman in the shower of a home with her hands tied, Reichert said. In a video played before the U. N. audience, another first responder described seeing gunshot wounds to women's breasts and the genitals of men and women alike. In another video, a woman described as a survivor of the rave attack said she witnessed multiple men rape the same woman, then mutilate her. At the base where the bodies of victims were taken for identification, staff were shocked by ""the extent of the cruelty, the atrocities we witnessed,"" said Shari Mendes, a member of an Israeli reserve unit charged with preparing bodies of female soldiers for burial. For weeks after Oct. 7, staff members worked through hundreds of bodies, many of them charred, injured or mutilated beyond recognition, she said. Some arrived at the base with limbs removed. ""Many young women arrived in bloody, shredded rags, or just in underwear, and their underwear was often very bloody,"" Mendes recalled. A leader of her unit ""saw several female soldiers who were shot in the crotch, intimate parts, vagina, or shot in the breast"" in what ""seemed to be a systematic genital mutilation of a group of victims,"" Mendes added. Israeli officials have also circulated videos of what they say are interrogations of Hamas fighters captured on Oct. 7. In brief video clips played at the U. N. on Monday, two men said they witnessed sexual violence during the attacks. ""These were not merely sick, spur-of-the-moment decisions to defile and mutilate Israeli women and girls,"" said Gilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations. ""This was premeditated. This was planned. This was instructed. ""NPR cannot independently verify allegations of sexual violence. Hamas denies that its fighters committed sexual assault and rape. The U. N. has been a focus of Israel's criticism over this issue. ""To these organizations, Israeli women are not women. The rape of Israelis is not an act of rape. Their silence has been deafening,"" Erdan said Monday. Erdan sent photo evidence of the Hamas assaults to UN Women, the U. N. agency dedicated to women's issues and gender equality, to which the agency did not respond, he said. In a statement, UN Women responded that United Nations procedures ""can appear to be slow-moving"" and said it has been closely following reports of ""brutal acts of gender-based violence against women in Israel"" since the allegations first came to light. Asked about the allegations at a press conference Wednesday, U. N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said he supported an investigation. ""Atrocious forms of sexual violence need to be thoroughly investigated. We need to make sure that justice is served because that's what we owe the victims,"" Türk said. And in a Wednesday letter to the U. N. Security Council about the dangers faced by civilians in Gaza, U. N. Secretary-General António Guterres acknowledged the Oct. 7 allegations. ""Accounts of sexual violence during the attacks are appalling,"" he wrote. Health officials in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip say that about 16,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes since Oct. 7. They don't break out the numbers of Hamas fighters that includes but say most of the dead are women and children. A week-long cease-fire between Israel and Hamas last month allowed for the release of more than 100 hostages, all of them women and children, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli detention. But 138 hostages remain in captivity, including 15 additional women, Israeli officials say. Negotiations to extend the cease-fire to free all the remaining hostages broke down last week. ""It seems one of the reasons they don't want to turn women over that they've been holding hostage, and the reason this pause fell apart, is they don't want those women to be able to talk about what happened to them during their time in custody,"" said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller at a press briefing Monday.

164,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/06/1217344742/palestinians-in-chicago-mourn-loss-of-family-in-gaza,"Dr. Mohammed AbuSafia is a doctor from Northern Gaza. He traveled to the United States at the end of July for a two-month-long medical program at Cleveland Clinic. He planned to be back in Gaza by October 7. But due to travel delays, he had to start his externship one week late, meaning AbuSafia was still in the United States the day of the Hamas attack on Israel. ""I cried at the border when I had to say goodbye. And I cried constantly during the car ride from the border to the airport. Because I knew things can go bad at some point,"" AbuSafia said in an interview with Morning Edition. While AbuSafia was away, things did turn bad. He says his entire direct family was wiped out in two separate Israeli airstrikes. AbuSafia says the first airstrike hit his home on October 13th, killing his father and badly injuring his two brothers. A second airstrike on October 29th killed the rest of his family. Now he doesn't have a home or family to return to in Gaza. He's staying with his uncle Mohammed Abu Realh, who is a nurse from Gaza living in Chicago. The day of the first airstrike, AbuSafia recieved an unusually long text from his father before he was killed. ""I knew something bad [was] about to happen for some reason. In the message he said, just look after yourself and we hopefully will be okay. And after that, I received the news that night that my father was killed,"" AbuSafia said. AbuSafia says that his brother Ahmed suffered a spinal fracture. His youngest brother Amru's body was full of ricochets from the strike, and one of the ricochets penetrated his lung. The hospital needed to extract the ricochet to close the hole in order for him to breathe normally. AbuSafia's brothers stayed in the hospital for three days, but needed to stay for longer. ""As somebody who works in healthcare in America. . . this patient with these symptoms would need about ten days in the hospital until his lung collapse recovered,"" said Abu Realh. ""[The] other 17-year-old with a fractured spine should stay [on] his back with minimum movement for at least one month. ""But that's not possible with the huge number of critical cases overwhelming hospitals all over Gaza. After the brothers were forced to leave, AbuSafia's family had to find a car to transport them to his aunt's house two miles away from AlShifa hospital. ""If the patients are stable enough to actually be let out, even though the need the care, they are forced to leave because there are people with more severe casualties. There are people who lost limbs,"" said AbuSafia. ""This is how bad the situation is. ""The rest of AbuSafia's family sheltered at his aunt's home too. They thought the area around the hospital would be more safe. Then AbuSafia said the second airstrike hit his aunt's house, killing everybody else in his family except his aunt. ""A colleague at the AlShifa Hospital, she texted me saying, 'I don't know how to put this in words, but your brother Osama was killed. ' Because an Israeli airstrike had hit my aunt's house where they evacuated,"" said AbuSafia. After he heard the news, he was devastated. And at the same time, he was scared for the rest of his family. ""Where are they? Are they under the rubble? Are they alive? Are they injured? And it takes another five hours of waiting. Knowing that the worst could actually happen, which in fact happened. To hear that all of them were found, killed,"" he said. All together, at least 39 members of AbuSafia's family have been killed, including his mother, father, and five brothers. When NPR spoke to Abu Realh and AbuSafia on November 15th, the day Israeli forces raided AlShifa hospital, they were waiting to hear from their remaining family. ""We are waiting every single second to see if somebody tells me that they are still alive. That is the most difficult part,"" said Abu Realh. They were waiting for updates on AbuSafia's aunt and two toddlers who were hospitalized in AlShifa with severe burns. His aunt had to leave the hospital because there was no space. Abu Realh says he would typically get a text message from his family in Gaza every day with updates. On the day Abu Realh spoke to NPR, he did not get his daily text message. ""I'm not sure that they can survive without oxygen, without proper ventilation and proper care. There is no supply, there is no care, no electricity, no connection whatsoever. These are children,"" said Abu Realh. After the interview ended, communications remained down. They heard nothing from AbuSafia's aunt of the two children at AlShifa hospital for days. After a full week of limbo, Abu Realh texted NPR with the news that the two children, Malik and Noor AlDeen Shameya, had succumbed to their wounds. AbuSafia remembers his family in the tribute below. ""I want people to know that she was the most kind and the most loving mother ever. And that she was my, and my father of course, the very building blocks and original supporters of my whole life and my whole career. And they have taught me how to succeed since the very beginning. And they have dedicated their whole life just to see their kids grow, learn, work, and give back to the society. My father, he was my role model. He was one of the most patient, most strong [person] that I have ever known. Even if they're not there, I hope they can know that I continue on that path that they want me to take. I want them always also to know that they are alive with me. Everywhere I go. And with everything I do. "" ""My oldest brother, his name is Albaraa. I want the people to know he's the guy, whenever you have a problem, however slight it is, I go to talk to him. And we tried to figure out a solution together. We help each other. He's the person that you would call whenever you're in trouble, because you trust them infinitely. ANd that's Albaraa,"" said AbuSafia. ""He got engaged just three months [ago] and he was preparing for his wedding. "" ""For Osama, when you're passing through a certain path, you always want company with you. And when you make a decision in your life, you always want to have company with you in order for you both to support each other, and to hold each other's hands to be able to push themselves through. Me and him, we worked together. We studied together. We taught each other. And we walked in the same path. I want people to know he's the person to have by your side whenever you decide that you're going through a very long-term life decision. He's way more than a friend or a brother. He's a brother friend, or even something bigger,"" said AbuSafia. ""Husam was the closest of them. Husam is a high school student, he always looked up to me. He used to read up things online, scientific discoveries, read up about history, read up anything. And he would come up to me and start a discussion and we'll get to talk to each other about certain things. Because he liked to talk to his older brother. Both of us also played a lot of chess, and he used to actually beat [me] in chess. He's very bright, he liked artificial intelligence. And he wanted to grow and to explore all the opportunities the world would have given him. But unfortunately, that was taken from him. "" ""For Ahmed, he was a college student studying engineering. Ahmed was the funniest of my brothers. He was full of energy. Each time we go out, he's the person to give us all the best time, either with his jokes or with anything else. He's the person that everybody wants to be friends with. """"My youngest brother (Amru), he is what we call the fruit of the family. He used to play a lot of video games. And whenever he had any problem with any sort of thing during his playing time, he used to interrupt whatever I'm doing, whether it be studying or working. And he would interrupt you just to fix his games. And let me tell you, it's one of the things that I miss most is him interrupting me. I know he won't be interrupting me anymore.

As he grieved the loss of his brother, he said he became so depressed he lost all interest in life and wanted to die. ""I felt that we are unheard,"" Alnaouq told Morning Edition. ""That people don't care about us, that our stories are not heard, that our suffering is not noticed from anyone in the world, especially the West. "" One day, Alnaouq heard from one of his American journalist friends, who asked how he was really doing. He started crying, and said he was spending his time in the graveyard. She told him he should write about how he feels in English. At first, he didn't think it was a good idea. ""I told her, why would I do that? They will not care about our stories. They look at us as subhumans. That we are all terrorists,"" he said. But he eventually decided to pen his story, and he got a positive response from readers. ""They read my story and they care about me. It made me feel better that I was wrong. Some people care about us. Not all the listeners think of us as subhumans,"" he said. After going through the process of sharing his own personal story, Alnaouq wanted to offer an outlet for other young Palestinian writers to do the same. He started training writers from Gaza and pairing them up with international mentors to help them write their stories in English. The project then grew into him founding the organization We Are Not Numbers, and he's been working for the project ever since. Since 2015, We Are Not Numbers has published hundreds of stories, poems and features telling the stories of Palestinians. Over time, they've expanded to include writers from the West Bank, Lebanon, and Palestinians from all over the world – with Alnaouq moving from Gaza to London in the years since launching the project. After October 7, most of their writers have lost internet connection and electricity. We Are Not Numbers has managed to get some stories out from writers who have been able to briefly connect to the internet. And Alnaouq says the stories that do get out make a difference. ""I think Israel knows that citizen journalists in Palestine are making a huge difference by talking and posting about what's going on in Palestine. And that's why they are cutting the telecommunications in Gaza. Because they don't want the world to know what they are actually doing [on] the ground,"" said Alnaouq. He says it's more difficult to get stories out of Gaza than ever. ""Three of our writers have been killed already. Some of our writers lost their loved ones. Many of our writers lost their mothers, their fathers, their brothers and sisters. Many of them had to flee their homes and move south to live in a hospital or in a school,"" said Alnaouq. The UN Secretary General's office released a statement on Monday calling the humanitarian situation in Gaza a ""catastrophe"" that is ""getting worse by the day. "" Over a million people have been displaced from their homes in Gaza, sleeping in crowded school classrooms and hospitals to shelter from Israeli bombardment. ""No words can actually describe the horror that they are seeing now in Gaza,"" said Alnaouq. Alnaouq never imagined an Israeli airstrike would hit his family home in South Gaza because Israel had been asking people to evacuate to the area. Alnaouq said his father, two brothers, three sisters, and 14 nieces and nephews were killed on October 22nd. The only two who survived were his sister-in-law and nephew. His brother, who was next to them on the same bed, was killed. ""They were peaceful people who just wanted to live in peace, and wanted to have a good life,"" Alnaouq said. ""They were sleeping in my home when they were bombed and killed. ""The only family Alnaouq has left in Gaza are two sisters. He says he forces himself to check in on them every two days, although he dreads the call. ""The last time I talked to my sister two days ago, she told me that her children are starving, they don't have food, they don't have fresh water,"" he said. ""Two days ago, she told me that Israel just bombed her home. Every time I talk to them, they tell me some harsh news that I can't deal with. ""Alnaouq says he is a different person now. ""I'm changed forever. No words can actually describe what I am feeling, what I'm going through right now,"" said Alnaouq. ""My home, where I grew up, where I went to school, where I had all my memories. It's all gone in one minute. ""_________________________________________________Alnaouq remembers his family in the tribute below. ""My father was a very, very gentle man. Very kind person, very compassionate. He did not have dreams, to be honest. He was a very simple man who just wanted to live with his children and his safe home. And he was very proud of his children. He believed in the one-state solution. For example, he just wanted to have a state in which the Palestinians and the Jews and Muslims and Christians can live together in peace and in harmony. He worked for 30 years in Israel, as a construction builder. So he was a very kind man. And he did not deserve to die in this barbaric way. """"My older brother is a lawyer and he was a civil servant. My younger brother worked at a human rights organization. He was a translator and a researcher. My younger brother got a scholarship to do his master's degree in Australia just a few months ago and he was very excited to travel and to pursue his master's degree. He was very, very happy. And then he was killed. He did not survive to go to Australia. """"My older sister, she's a computer engineer. She's married and she had four children. She and her four children were killed. My other sister, she's a teacher and she had five children. She and her five children were killed. My other sister, she is an accountant. She's very smart. When she graduated, she graduated top of the university. She was very, very talented. She is married. Then she had three children. She and all her children were killed. ""This level of loss is not uncommon to see in Gaza. Alnaouq's family is one of many who have been nearly or entirely wiped out. Since his family was killed, Alnaouq hasn't had the time to grieve. ""I really need time to grieve, but I don't. Because I believe for the Palestinians, we don't have the luxury right now to grieve. We have the responsibility to speak. And we are all willing to speak. So please, when you have the choice to give the Palestinians a voice, please do that, because they need you.

166,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/06/1216150515/keffiyeh-hamas-palestinians-israel-gaza,"Ashish Prashar was at a Brooklyn playground with his 18-month-old son in early November when he said a woman approached him and asked if he supported Hamas. She got angrier and angrier, Prashar said, and the situation escalated. In a recording of part of the interaction posted on social media, the woman, Hadasa Bozakkaravani, can be seen yelling and throwing things at Prashar, saying ""you and your son go away. "" She has been charged with a number of hate crimes and plead not guilty when arraigned last month, according to court records. Bozakkaravani's lawyer did not respond to NPR's request for comment. Prashar is not Palestinian, or Muslim, or Arab. He's British-Punjabi. But he was wearing a scarf that's become synonymous with Palestinians: A black and white keffiyeh. Since the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7 and Israel's bombardment of Gaza in response, the keffiyeh has drawn increased attention in the United States. Over the Thanksgiving weekend, three students of Palestinian descent were shot in Vermont — two of them were wearing the keffiyeh. So what is a keffiyeh, who wears it, and how did it become a symbol for Palestinians?First, the basics. The keffiyeh, also known as a hatta, is a traditional Arab headdress. Historically, it was worn by nomadic communities — or Bedouins — in historic Palestine. It's typically made of cotton and adorned with distinctive woven patterns. It comes in a variety of colors, though over the last century, the black and white one has become synonymous with Palestinians. Some say patterns on the keffiyeh symbolize different aspects of Palestinian life: the bold black stripes on the edges symbolize the historical trade routes that used to go through Palestine; the fishnet-like design represents the Palestinians' ties to the Mediterranean Sea; and the curvy lines resemble olive trees, a major point of pride for Palestinians. Though none of these claims can be backed up by historical evidence, over the past 10 years they've become embraced by Palestinians in the diaspora to be the meaning behind their keffiyeh's patterns. ""In my research and in my experience, often interacting with the keffiyeh from the 19th century, I often see a variety of colors,"" said Wafa Ghnaim, a Palestinian dress expert and a senior research fellow at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ""I see white-black like we see today, but also green. And sometimes I see threads of gold and red. It's really not until the 1930s that we start to see the keffiyeh change in meaning, not by the patterning that's in the scarf, but in its use. ""Listen to All Things Considered each day here or on your local member station for more stories like this. Until the 1920s, the keffiyeh was almost exclusively worn by Bedouin men, according to Ghnaim, and it was simply a way to identify nomadic men in historic Palestine from villagers, fellaheen, and town people. According to Ghnaim, the first time we see the keffiyeh used as a political statement was during the Arab Revolt in Palestine in 1936 — an uprising against British rule that included demands for independence and an end to Jewish immigration. At that time, the majority of the armed resistance was taking place in the villages, and the fighters used the keffiyeh to hide their features — helping it to become associated with the revolution. The revolution's leaders issued an order for men to wear the keffiyeh to express solidarity with the revolutionaries and so that the British could not distinguish the fighters from others. In the 1960s, it became associated with Palestinian nationalism, particularly due to its adoption by leaders like Yasser Arafat. During this era, it represented solidarity and resistance against the Israeli occupation. The apocryphal story among many Palestinians is that Arafat folded his keffiyeh in a way that reminded him of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, and let the side panel drape in a way that resembled the historic map of Palestine. Around the same time, the fedayeen — a term used to describe nationalist Palestinian militants — conducted guerilla operations while wearing the keffiyeh. Other prominent Palestinians also donned the keffiyeh during that time, included Leila Khaled — who was involved in two plane hijackings in 1969 and 1970 as part of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. ""That's when we start to see women wearing the black and white keffiyeh, specifically Palestinian women,"" Ghnaim said. ""So it wasn't just a male headdress anymore. By the 1960s, it became something worn by Palestinian women as well around their neck. "" It depends who you ask. For many Palestinians, it symbolizes their yearning for freedom and serves a nod to their history. For some non-Palestinians, it's a show of solidarity. Recently, it has also been associated with the Hamas spokesperson known only by his nom de guerre, Abu Obeida. He became known as al-mulatham or the ""masked one"" because his face is always covered by a red and white keffiyeh that shows only his eyes. His voice — and his keffiyeh — have become familiar in Arab households during this current conflict. He has praised the Oct. 7 attack that the Israeli government says killed 1,200, including women and children, as a victory for the Palestinian cause. He has maintained that stance, even as the Israeli response has killed more than 16,000 people in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which includes mostly women and children. There is a long history of Palestinians wearing the keffiyeh to cover their faces, according to Ghnaim, not just as a form of activism but also to protect them from tear gas or from identification during protests. For others, like queer Palestinian content creator Rand Jitan, who lives in New York, the keffiyeh has no connection to a specific group or organization — but, rather, to her heritage. Her keffiyeh was a gift from her therapist, and she said she wears it whenever she can and in a variety of ways: draped around her neck, wrapped around her head, and sometimes even as a blanket when she goes to the beach or the park. ""I put it on and it gives me a feeling,"" she said. ""How powerful is that? Like years and years, these histories that we have in a f---ing cloth. It's crazy. It's awesome. It's incredible. It's beautiful. ""Jitan styles her keffiyeh in different ways, which she said garners different reactions from people. ""Sometimes when I wear it on my head and it kind of looks like a hijab — or it looks like what somebody might see on TV and assume to be a 'terrorist' — like, I feel even more empowered doing that,"" Jitan said. ""I'm not looking for a reaction, I'm looking for people to internally challenge themselves. And I like that. ""For others, however, like Prashar and the students in Vermont, there is a fear that the keffiyeh can provoke a violent reaction. Ghnaim sees this violence as a reflection of how dehumanized Palestinians and their cause for independence have become. ""The keffiyeh and our clothing will always reflect our current context and our identity,"" she said. ""This is the history of Palestinian dress. We always express identity through our dress. And I think right now we see that, also, it seems people reflect their own beliefs and judgements of our identity onto our dress. "" For Prashar, the confrontation in the Brooklyn playground has made him more defiant. ""It means that I stand in solidarity with all oppressed people, especially Palestinians,"" he said of wearing the keffiyeh. ""I understand that it means a lot of different things to a lot of people. But for me, it's showing that I see them, I'm there for them. """"I'm never taking it off. """,npr_articles/article_166.txt,npr_results/article_166.txt.json
167,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/06/1217508410/israel-hamas-gaza-palestinians-refugees,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Some of the heaviest fighting since the start of Israel's air-and-ground assault on Gaza was taking place Wednesday in Khan Younis, with artillery shelling and gunfire echoing through the Palestinian territory's second-largest city. But combat operations were also continuing in Gaza's north, the focus of Israel's first phase of the war that Israel says is aimed at crushing Hamas. ""We are in the heart of Jabaliya, in the heart of Shujaiya, and now also in the heart of Khan Younis,"" the head of Israel's Southern Command, Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, said at a news briefing on Tuesday. Jabaliya, the site of a major refugee camp, and Shujaiya, are located in Gaza's north. Khan Younis, considered a Hamas stronghold, is located toward the south end of the Strip. In Khan Younis, the reputed home of the Islamist militant group's top leader,  Yahya Sinwar, Finkelman said senior Hamas leaders were being ""eliminated. ""He said the Israel Defense Forces on Tuesday were taking part ""in the most intense day since the beginning of the ground operation, in terms of terrorists killed, the number of firefights, and the use of firepower from the land and air. ""He said Israeli soldiers were ""destroying weaponry and terrorist infrastructure, both above and below ground. ""The statement marks the first time that Israel has acknowledged that ground forces are engaged in and around Khan Younis. Israel also released video it said showed soldiers operating in northern Gaza. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the IDF said on Wednesday that Israel's air force had hit 250 targets in the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, and that ground troops ""continue to locate and destroy weapons, underground shafts, explosive charges and other terrorist infrastructures. ""The fighting has forced hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians to flee or risk death. They are warned by Israel's military, using robocalls, online maps and leaflets dropped by airplanes, to move to ""safer zones. "" The areas considered relatively free from fighting include a tiny sliver of coastal land known as Muwasi, and the Rafah area along the Egyptian border. Bilal Shbeir, an English teacher who survived Israeli strikes around his home in central Gaza, says the last two days of the conflict have been ""the toughest, the hardest, the most difficult. """"We have never had this before,"" he told NPR. Many Palestinians who have fled south to Rafah sat in the streets, not quite sure where to stay. Mustafa, who gave only his first name when interviewed, blamed Hamas for not securing shelter for residents before waging war. Speaking to NPR's Morning Edition, Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who has just returned from a visit to Gaza, said what she saw there ""is a shattering, devastating humanitarian situation, and the conditions are such that an adequate humanitarian response will not be possible if the situation persists. ""Spoljaric said that due to the fighting, ""our operating space is shrinking. So we have very limited mobility at the moment. """"There are very few remaining hospitals and the surgical teams are working around the clock,"" she said. ""But there is no surgical capacity in many parts of Gaza, so people have to move for long distances and this is extremely dangerous given the heavy wounds that they are suffering. ""UNRWA, the United Nations relief agency that aids Palestinians, issued yet another in a long series of dire warnings in recent days. It warned of ""[another] wave of displacement"" in Gaza. ""[T]he situation is getting worse each minute. There is no 'safe' zone, the entire Gaza Strip has become one of the most dangerous places in the world. There is nowhere to go as shelters, including UNRWA are overflowing,"" the agency said  on X. The United Nations has estimated that 80% of Gaza's 2. 3 million people have been internally displaced by the fighting since Oct. 7, when Hamas carried out a surprise attack on communities in southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking around 240 hostages, Israel says. In response, Israel launched airstrikes and in the following weeks, a full-scale ground invasion of Gaza. More than 16,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the fighting began, according to Gaza health officials, and nearly three-quarters of the population has been displaced. International pressure over the death and suffering inflicted on Gazans has led to growing calls for Israel to better protect Palestinian civilians. Just since the collapse of a temporary truce last week, more than 1,200 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's health ministry. Israel says 13 soldiers have been killed in the renewed combat operations. Last week, U. S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin gave a speech at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California, warning that Israel risks ""strategic defeat"" if it doesn't protect Palestinians in Gaza. ""The center of gravity is the civilian population and if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat,"" Austin said. Israel's Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said Tuesday that, ""We act professionally [and] evacuate the population ahead of time from the battle zones. """"We are asked a lot about the destruction in Gaza,"" Halevi said. ""Hamas is the [answer] to those questions,"" adding, ""Our forces find weapons in almost every house, terrorists are found in many houses, we fight them. """"These things require the use of a wide range of fire, both to damage the enemy and, of course, to protect our forces. That is why they operate powerfully"" while still going to ""great efforts to minimize harm"" to civilians, Halevi said. Brian Carter, an analyst with the Washington, D. C. -based Critical Threats Project, which has been tracking the urban fighting in Gaza, says Israeli forces have not been making fast progress on the ground. ""Clearing operations take a very long time,"" Carter said. ""In areas they have already cleared they still have to conduct military operations as Hamas fighters attack their positions in these cleared areas. ""Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and ministers of his war cabinet met with several hostages who were released after being held for weeks in Gaza by Hamas. The released hostages castigated the Israeli government officials for claiming to have intelligence on Hamas locations yet bombing indiscriminately. They said during captivity they were more afraid of Israeli bombs than their militant captors. One of the former hostages berated officials over reports that Israel was considering flooding Hamas tunnels, where many of the captives have been held.

168,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/06/1216088371/guns-israel-hamas-gaza,"TEL AVIV, Israel — With an assault rifle slung over his right shoulder, Amitai Turkel strolls along Jaffa's cafe-lined waterfront holding hands with his wife, Oriya. The young couple attracts no notice from passersby who are also enjoying a midday walk in the warm Mediterranean breeze. ""I feel more safe. I feel more comfortable and calm,"" Oriya says when asked about her husband's military-issue Tavor and its loaded magazine. Amitai Turkel, 24, is one of hundreds of thousands of reservists, or miluimnikim, Israel activated in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants that shook this nation of 9 million to its core. ""Seeing soldiers in the street is nothing new. It's part of Israel,"" says Turkel, who is originally from a West Bank settlement but now studies computer science in Jerusalem. ""Usually if you see someone with a gun, you know he is military or security or something like that,"" he says. That could soon be changing. In the aftermath of the deadly Oct. 7 Hamas attack in Israel, the Israeli government has moved to loosen the rules around gun ownership, fast-tracking the permitting process and speeding up approvals. This week, the national security minister said the ministry has received more than 260,000 new firearm permit requests since Oct. 7 and is approving up to 3,000 of them per day, compared with 100 approvals a day before the attack. Compared with the U. S. , Israel has relatively restrictive firearm laws. It also has a mandatory national military service requirement for citizens over age 18, and with few exceptions, guns are restricted to Israelis with weapons training or in security professions. Untrained civilians, including the vast majority of Palestinian citizens of Israel, who are exempt from military service, don't qualify. Israelis have ""a defense mentality rather than an offense mentality"" when it comes to guns, says Jonah Mink, 38, a physician who grew up in Buffalo, N. Y. , but moved to Israel five years ago and became an Israeli citizen. In Israel, he says, ""there's actually something real and immediate to defend against and not just an abstract notion of defense from bad guys. ""Today, that real and immediate threat is Hamas, which carried out the Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people. Israel's newspapers and airwaves have been saturated with stories of brave kibbutz members grabbing rifles to defend themselves as Hamas militants stormed through their communities, which has fueled the drive for freer access to firearms. Mink, who lives in Tel Aviv with his wife and two children, says he himself wanted to buy a Glock pistol ""for personal protection"" after the attack. ""My wife has always said we're never going to have a gun in the house,"" he says. ""But now we're saying well maybe we should . . . because who the hell knows what's gonna happen in the world. "" Without having served in the Israeli military, however, Mink doesn't qualify. Nonetheless, he has been kept busy processing the medical paperwork required for his patients to get guns. Before the Hamas attack two months ago, he'd been filling out two or three of those certifications a month, but in recent weeks, it has jumped to three or four a week, he says. But the government's effort to ease gun restrictions has not come without controversy. In the days after the Hamas attack, the office of National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right politician once convicted of inciting anti-Arab racism, purchased 10,000 rifles to arm civilian security militias in Israeli border towns, West Bank settlements and cities with a mix of Jewish and Arab populations. However, after an Israeli newspaper reported that the ministry was using unqualified personnel to approve the permits, Ben-Gvir's deputy in charge of firearms licensing resigned. Noa Sattath, executive director of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, says the government's drive for more guns has skirted the definition of what's legal. ""Laws were not passed through the regular procedure of legislation but are fast-tracked as emergency regulations,"" she says. ""So there's less oversight on them. ""Last week in a deadly shooting by Hamas militants at a bus stop just outside Jerusalem, three people were killed by the assailants. A fourth man, Yuval Doron Castleman, was also killed when he exited a vehicle with his licensed firearm to help engage the gunmen. Apparently mistaken for one of the attackers, he was killed by soldiers. At a news conference after the shooting, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his government's push to relax weapons licenses. ""As soon as you distribute more weapons, things can happen,"" he said. ""Such is life. "" The prime minister's remarks were seen as cavalier by some Israelis and immediately drew criticism. Unlike the United States, which has among the highest per capita gun homicide rates in the world, Israel's rate is much lower. More guns on Israel's streets is a prospect that unnerves many. That's especially true with the charge being led by Ben-Gvir, who has proposed a national guard directly under his control, which some, including Israel's defense minister, view as essentially a private militia. According to Sattath, Ben-Gvir wants a force ""that would be obedient to him and not follow the police procedure of professional conduct . . . in order to both abuse the population and continue the animosity and tension between the communities. ""Amir Badran is a Palestinian citizen of Israel and far-left candidate running for mayor of Tel Aviv-Jaffa. He recounts a wave of mob violence in 2021 that swept through cities where Israeli Jews and Palestinians live side by side. He blames right-wing vigilantes and says these are the same people whom the government wants to arm. ""This is something that we fear as Arabs,"" Badran says. ""These guns soon will be turned upon us,"" he says. ""Us means me as an Arab, you as a Jew and us as a community. """,npr_articles/article_168.txt,npr_results/article_168.txt.json
169,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/05/1217459477/harvard-penn-mit-antisemitism-congress-hearing,"The presidents of Harvard, UPenn and MIT testified on Capitol Hill about rising antisemitism on their campuses, an issue that has plagued institutions of higher learning across the country in recent months. Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and Israel's military response in Gaza have fueled tensions, protests and even violence across the U. S. , with reports of both antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents surging dramatically since then. A recent report by the Anti-Defamation League and Hillel International found that while a majority of Jewish students felt physically and emotionally safe on campus before Oct. 7, those numbers have dropped to 46% and 33%, respectively.  Claudine Gay of Harvard, Elizabeth Magill of Penn and Sally Kornbluth of MIT spoke before the Republican-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce for several hours on Tuesday, condemning the rise in antisemitic incidents and defending their administrations' responses. All three — who started their jobs either this year or last — acknowledged and vowed to tackle the parallel surge in Islamophobia and other forms of hate as well. ""Today's hearing is focused on antisemitism and its direct impact on the Jewish community,"" Magill said in her opening remarks. ""But history teaches us that where antisemitism goes unchecked, other forms of hate spread and ultimately can threaten democracy. "" The presidents were joined by Pamela Nadell, a professor of history and Jewish studies at American University, who provided context on the history of antisemitism in the U. S. as well as the Biden administration's efforts to combat it. The hearing — which was titled ""Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism"" — turned combative at times. Republican lawmakers grilled the administrators on topics like ideological diversity, foreign university funding and specific disciplinary actions. Committee chair Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N. C. , described the hearing in her opening remarks as an opportunity for leaders to ""answer to and atone for the many specific instances of vitriolic, hate-filled antisemitism on your college campuses that have denied students the safe learning environment they're due. "" She added that the witnesses were speaking not only to lawmakers but to the students who are looking to them for protection, noting that several students affiliated with Jewish and pro-Israel campus groups at those schools were sitting in the audience. Jon Fansmith, senior vice president for government relations and national engagement at the American Council on Education, told NPR beforehand that a hearing focused on retroactively criticizing a few institutions' tough choices isn't likely to actually help students. But he says it could still benefit the public by painting a better picture of the challenges facing universities, especially when compounded by pressure from on and off campus. ""I think having a greater understanding of what's actually at play here, people will be, frankly, I think, a little bit more sympathetic to the choices some of these leaders have made,"" Fansmith says. ""And if that's what comes out of this hearing, then that's a net positive. "" Tuesday's hearing cast a spotlight on a much larger problem, as university leaders nationwide navigate the balance between protecting free speech and keeping students safe. All three witnesses spoke of that challenge. Kornbluth, of MIT, said she believes there is a difference ""between what we can say to each other — that is, what we have a right to say — and what we should say as members of one community. "" She said that people who want the university to shut down protests are effectively arguing for ""speech codes,"" which she says do not work. ""Problematic speech needs to be countered with other speech and education,"" she said, emphasizing — as the other universities' leaders did — that MIT's free speech protections do not extend to harassment or incitement of violence. Fansmith, of the American Council on Education, says higher education institutions are in an incredibly difficult position, legally and ethically. For example: What does free speech look like when both sides see the same words in different ways? He notes university leaders have been trying to balance these responsibilities long before Oct. 7, and it would be unreasonable to expect anyone to suddenly do it in a way that satisfies everyone. ""It's always easier to criticize the decision than make one, especially when you're making one in real time with very heated, very passionate views on both sides,"" he says. Jonathan Friedman, the director of free expression and education programming at PEN America, told NPR that while the tensions of the moment demand action, universities should try to stand up for ""something greater than the moment we're in,"" like their deeper commitment to freedom of expression and supporting all students. ""That's what universities do best in the best of times, and that's really where they need to have their focus right now,"" he said. The hearing began with a moment of silence for the Israelis killed, injured and held by Hamas, as well as a brief video montage of pro-Palestinian protesters at all three schools calling for ""intifada,"" which Jewish groups say can be interpreted as a call for violence against Israel and those who support it. The presidents' opening statements were broadly similar: They condemned the Hamas attack and antisemitic incidents on campus, discussed their free speech policies (and the challenges they present) and vowed to work immediately and in the long term to combat hate in all forms. ""During these difficult days, I have felt the bonds of our community strained,"" said Gay, of Harvard. ""In response, I have sought to confront hate while preserving free expression. This is difficult work and I know that I have not always gotten it right. "" Harvard has been under scrutiny since Oct. 7, when dozens of student groups signed a letter holding Israel ""entirely responsible for all unfolding violence,"" prompting widespread backlash. Other incidents, including a tense confrontation at a ""die-in"" demonstration outside Harvard Business School, have continued to keep campus on edge. Several lawmakers pointed out that the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) ranked Harvard last in its annual free speech ratings this September. At one point, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N. Y. — a Harvard alum — pushed Gay repeatedly over protesters' use of the word ""intifada"" and ultimately accused her of lacking ""moral clarity. "" Gay sought to dispel the criticism that Harvard didn't act swiftly enough to condemn Hamas or offer support for its Jewish community. She said the school has increased security measures, expanded reporting channels and augmented its counseling and mental health services. She also noted that Harvard is creating learning opportunities for students, including examining how antisemitism and other forms of hate manifest on campus and beyond. ""Antisemitism is a symptom of ignorance, and the cure for ignorance is knowledge,"" she added. Harvard and Penn are among the nearly 60 schools that the U. S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights is investigating over complaints of antisemitic and anti-Muslim harassment since the start of the war. Penn has reported a slew of antisemitic incidents, including threatening emails and messages projected onto buildings. Several influential donors ended their financial support for the university and called on Magill to resign, arguing the administration did not go far enough in condemning a Palestinian literature festival that took place on campus in September and included speakers who had previously made antisemitic remarks. Magill noted that Tuesday's hearing came two days after a viral pro-Palestinian demonstration outside an Israeli restaurant in Philadelphia, which she called a ""troubling and shameful act of antisemitism"" that ""left many in the community upset and afraid. "" Magill said the university is working to implement the three-pronged action plan to combat antisemitism it announced last month, which focuses on safety and security, engagement and education. She said she also created a task force to issue additional recommendations, and a student advisory group to ensure Jewish students can share their experiences. ""As a student of constitutional democracy I know that we need both safety and free expression for universities and ultimately democracy to thrive,"" she said. ""At times these competing principles can be difficult to balance but I am determined to get it right. "" Universities are under pressure to act amid security threats, mounting complaints and lawsuits from students and withdrawals from both donors and applicants. They are also under pressure from the Biden administration. The U. S. Department of Education said last month in a letter to college administrators that schools must take aggressive action to address antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents on campus — or else risk losing federal funding.  Fansmith told NPR that such a threat is unlikely to take effect, noting it would have major implications for tens of thousands of students who had nothing to do with the underlying issue. But he said universities should still take it seriously. Nadell, the American University professor, pointed to the first-of-its-kind national strategy for countering antisemitism that the Biden administration released in May. It includes more than 100 calls to action aimed at Congress, civil society, state and local governments, academic institutions, businesses and religious communities. Nadell urged Congress to do ""everything in its power"" to support that strategy, as well as the administration's forthcoming strategy for fighting Islamophobia. That includes, she said, fully funding the U. S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights. House Republicans have proposed significant funding cuts (about 25%) to the agency, which is charged with investigating campus discrimination claims. Nadell said such a move would be ""unconscionable,"" noting that the office focuses on all forms of hate, not just antisemitism. Several other Democrats called for more funding — and called out Republicans — throughout the hearing.  ""You can't have it both ways,"" said Virginia Rep. Bobby Scott, the committee's ranking Democrat. ""You can't call for action and hamstring the agency charged with taking that action to protect students' civil rights.

170,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/05/1217240412/israel-gaza-khan-younis,"JERUSALEM — Israel's military on Tuesday appeared to be encircling Gaza's second largest city, Khan Younis, pushing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians deeper south and hobbling international relief groups already struggling to deliver aid to the besieged territory. While the Israel Defense Forces expanded its offensive in northern and central Gaza, it said it had raided the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza for the first time in pursuit of Hamas targets. Meanwhile, Palestinian residents said Israeli troops have advanced near Khan Younis, a Hamas stronghold that is home to the top Hamas leader in the territory. The heavy fighting overnight forced many to flee to the southern city of Rafah, along the Egyptian border. UNRWA, the United Nations relief agency that aids Palestinians, put the humanitarian concerns bluntly: ""We have said it repeatedly. We are saying it again. No place is safe in Gaza. """"The level of human suffering is intolerable. The resumption of the military operation and its expansion further in southern Gaza is repeating horrors from past weeks,"" it said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). Satellite images taken Sunday showed Israeli troops massing outside Khan Younis, according to The Associated Press. The city had a pre-invasion population of more than 400,000 people. More than three-quarters of Gaza's 2. 3 million people have been displaced by the Israeli offensive, which was launched in response to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that Israel says killed 1,200 people. Israel's air and ground offensive in Gaza has killed more than 15,000 people, according to the health ministry in Hamas-governed Gaza. In a statement on Tuesday, Israel's military said that since the beginning of ground operations in Gaza some five weeks ago, it had fired 100,000 artillery shells in the territory that occupies just 140 square miles. The heightened Israeli bombardment came as Israel has been under pressure from the U. S. to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza and international relief groups said they were finding it increasingly difficult to distribute aid to refugees from the fighting. The head of UNRWA said Israel's bombardment of southern Gaza was further strangling aid deliveries and increasing ""mass displacement"" of Palestinians. ""The number of civilians killed is rapidly increasing. Civilians, including men, women, children, older persons, the sick and people with disabilities are the most to suffer,"" Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said Monday. UNRWA warned that 600,ooo Palestinians in Gaza had been ordered to move to avoid death and injury amid the Israeli bombardment. The agency said an influx of people internally displaced by the conflict to Rafah, Gaza's southernmost governorate, could more than double the area's normal population, further straining relief efforts. The Palestinian Red Crescent Societies (PRCS) on Tuesday said Israeli tanks had targeted ""the vicinity area of two PRCS ambulances,"" as the injured and dead were being transported. It said the attack occurred in central Gaza near the city of Deir al Balah. ""One paramedic was lightly injured and the ambulances were damaged,"" it said. The PRCS also said it had ""lost contact"" with its operations room in Gaza due to a telecommunications blackout. It expressed concern for the safety of its teams in Gaza ""amidst the ongoing and intense Israeli airstrikes around the clock"" and worried about its ability to continue to provide emergency services,"" adding that a lack of communications ""hinders the arrival of ambulances to the injured and wounded. ""Meanwhile, the director-general of the World Health Organization said that Israel's military had notified the WHO of the need to ""remove our supplies from our medical warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours, as ground operations will put it beyond use. "" ""We appeal to Israel to withdraw the order, and take every possible measure to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and humanitarian facilities,"" wrote Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a post on X. Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), a unit of the Ministry of Defense, said Tuesday that 180 aid trucks carrying food, water, shelter equipment and medical supplies were dispatched through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. In addition, two diesel fuel tankers were sent, a COGAT spokesperson said. The fuel is ""designated for the operation of vital infrastructure in the Gaza Strip,"" the spokesperson said.

171,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/05/1215600036/palestinian-doctor-gaza-israel-hamas-war,"Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish initially gained prominence in the 1990s as the first Palestinian doctor appointed to work in an Israeli hospital, paving the way for many others that followed. ""If you go to any hospital, you will see Palestinian doctors, Israeli doctors, nurses, patients. All of them are equal inside the hospital,"" he said. I first met Abuelaish in 2001 in southern Israel, in the the desert town of Beersheba, where he straddled two worlds. During the week, he worked and lived at Soroka Hospital, where he specialized in fertility medicine. On weekends, he drove a short distance home to the Gaza Strip to be with his wife and eight children in the Jabalia refugee camp. His aim, then and now, is the same. ""I want equality between Palestinians and Israelis, not someone superior to the other,"" he said. ""No one will accept the others being superior to them. ""Yet none of his efforts spared him or his family from terrible tragedies in the Israeli-Palestinian fighting. He was pushing for peace in the 1990s as the Israelis and Palestinians tried — but ultimately failed — to reach a deal ending generations of conflict. In the heavy fighting that followed in the early 2000s, an Israeli clampdown on Gaza eventually made it too difficult for Abuelaish to enter Israel to work. Then came a terrible loss in 2008 when his wife died of leukemia. The following year, he suffered another devastating blow that played out live on Israeli television. During an intense bout of Israel-Hamas fighting in 2009, Israel's Channel 10 television station called him regularly for an update from Gaza, which he delivered in his fluent Hebrew. One evening he was about to go on air when an Israeli tank shell slammed into his home. Three of his daughters, ages 14, 15 and 21, were killed, as was one of his nieces. The doctor wailed in grief as he spoke to the Israeli television anchor. ""My God, My God, what have we done?"" he cried. ""I wanted to try to save them, but they died of head wounds immediately. ""Abuelaish spoke to NPR later that year. ""I lost three precious, beautiful daughters, but I can't return them back,"" he said. ""I have five more [children], and I have the future. I have many good things that I can do for others. ""He wrote a book entitled, I Shall Not Hate: A Gaza Doctor's Journey on the Road to Peace and Human Dignity. He left Gaza with his surviving children. Today he's a professor in the School of Public Health at the University of Toronto, where I reached him for this interview. Abuelaish has remained in close contact with relatives and friends in Gaza, and visited this summer, before the current fighting. But now tragedy has struck again. He said that on Nov. 7, an Israeli airstrike hit the home where his relatives were sheltering in the Jabalia refugee camp, killing 22 members of his extended family, including cousins, nephews and nieces. ""I just saw them in August. I was there and now they are gone,"" he said. ""One niece is a medical doctor and she is 25 years old. She was supposed to start her residency soon. ""Every day seems to bring a new jolt of pain — like the recent fighting around Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. Israel said its military took over the hospital because Hamas operated from a network of tunnels network below the medical compound. Abuelaish first went to the hospital at age 9, spending nearly a week there as he was treated for rheumatic fever. Later, as a young doctor, he worked at Al-Shifa. Hospitals have traditionally been one of the few places in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict where both sides check their hostilities at the door. Abuelaish recalled the newborns in Israeli hospital nurseries where he worked. ""They are in their beds close to each other. You can't recognize who is your daughter or who is your son,"" he said. ""Once they step outside the borders of the hospital, they become different and they are treated differently. Why? That's the problem. It's man-made. ""Abuelaish remains in touch with Israelis he's befriended. But with emotions running so high during the war, he acknowledges they don't see eye to eye. ""I want them to see the pain of the Palestinians as equal to the Israelis,"" he said. ""Every baby is a precious. Every human life is a precious. And that's when we start to see the other side. ""He sees this war, like the ones that preceded it, as sheer folly, predicting nothing will be resolved. ""I hope the war will end. But I hope no one will celebrate victory, because all are losers,"" he said. Greg Myre is an NPR national security correspondent who was based in Jerusalem from 2000-2007.

172,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/05/1217056536/houthis-explainer-red-sea-yemen-saudi-middle-east-israel-gaza,"Since the war between Israel and Hamas broke out in Gaza in October, some have been warning that the localized fighting could erupt into a regional conflict. Those warnings came in November when Hezbollah vollied rockets into Israel from across the border in Lebanon and as the U. S. sent two aircraft carriers and supporting ships to the region. And they came in early December when Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen attacked commercial vessels in the Red Sea in an incident that also involved a U. S. warship on patrol in the area. Houthi attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea have continued, most recently over the weekend when the U. S. said it responded to a cargo ship's distress call and downed two anti-ship ballistic missiles fired from Houthi-controlled areas. U. S. Central Command said it sunk three small Houthi boats and killed their crews after they fired on U. S. helicopters. The Houthis have said they are aiming to block Israeli ships from passing through the Red Sea until Israel halts its military operations in Gaza. Earlier in December, U. S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced a multinational security effort known as Operation Prosperity Guardian to protect shipping vessels passing through the Red Sea from Houthi attacks. Still, U. S. officials don't expect the danger to subside right away. ""We are cleareyed that the Houthi reckless attacks will likely continue,"" Vice Adm. Brad Cooper said in an interview with The Associated Press. In addition to the attacks by Hezbollah and the Houthis, other militant groups backed by Iran have carried out dozens of attacks against U. S. military forces spread throughout the Middle East in recent weeks, according to the Pentagon. While these attacks have been frequent, they've so far been on a relatively small scale and the U. S. has responded with limited airstrikes. Yet they point to the volatility in the region and the possibility that attacks could escalate into a much larger battle. The Houthis emerged as a rebel group in the late 1980s and '90s, but grew in military might after the turn of the century and went to war with the Yemeni government. In 2014, the Houthis overthrew the country's government and gained control of the capital, Sanaa, which the militia still controls today. Houthis follow a branch of Shia Islam, as does the Iranian leadership, which helped lead to their alliance. In 2015, a coalition of countries led by Saudi Arabia launched a military intervention in Yemen on behalf of the internationally recognized government in an attempt to beat back the Houthis. Saudi Arabia is a top rival of Iran, which supports the Houthis with weapons, intelligence and other political and diplomatic aid. That conflict has been raging for years and spawned the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, according to the United Nations, with more than 24 million people in need of aid and protection. Still, the Houthis managed to withstand the offensive and remain in control of large swaths of territory and much of the Yemeni population. Thomas Juneau, a University of Ottawa professor who studies the Middle East, said the Houthis have been emboldened by their ability to resist the Saudi-led attacks, and as a result they've been trying to grow from a domestic power into a regional player in recent years. ""We've seen them attack the [United Arab Emirates, which had allied with Saudi Arabia in the war]. We've seen them attack Saudi Arabia. We have seen them, in the past, attack shipping in the southern half of the Red Sea,"" he said. ""So when the Gaza war started in early October, to me it was a matter of time before the Houthis would become involved militarily. ""The attacks likely would also be viewed as messages of support to Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah and may be popular at home too, according to Juneau, where there are strong pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli attitudes. ""To be seen domestically as not only opposing Israel politically but actually trying to do something about it — i. e. sending missiles and drones — is a classic way to mobilize domestic support by playing on these pro-Palestinian popular feelings,"" he said. This is not the first time the Houthis have targeted ships — including U. S. naval vessels — in the Red Sea off the country's western coast. In 2016, missiles were fired from coastal Yemen toward a U. S. Navy destroyer twice in four days. The U. S. responded by firing missiles at three radar installations in Houthi territory. Juneau said the Houthis didn't target American vessels again for several years, but it's unclear if a similar U. S. response today would have the same deterrent effect. ""It will be much more difficult to do that today than in 2016, because the Houthis are far more powerful now than they were before and they feel much more emboldened,"" he said. The Houthis have also fired missiles directly at Israel before, but in one such attack in November Israel's military stopped it with its air defenses. Going after commercial ships also gives the Houthis leverage, Juneau added, to negotiate with impacted nations and raise the ambitious militia group's international profile. Last month, Japan announced it was approaching the group for talks after a Japanese-operated cargo ship was hijacked in the Red Sea. ""That's exactly what the Houthis want,"" Juneau said. ""By forcing the Japanese government — which is a very important G7 country and so on — to deal with them directly, they are looking for recognition, at least de facto, of their status as the governing authority inside Yemen.

173,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/04/1216813827/israel-hamas-gaza-hostages-ceasefire-airstrikes,"TEL AVIV, Israel — The plight of Palestinian refugees, hemmed in and cut off by Israeli combat operations in Gaza, is becoming more acute as infrastructure is destroyed and civilian deaths rise in the wake of a cease-fire that ended last week, aid officials said Monday. ""People have lost everything and they need everything,"" UNRWA, the United Nations relief agency that aids Palestinian, said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). ""Gaza's population will soon begin dying from diseases as well as Israeli bombardment. "" More than 15,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the conflict, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health. That figure includes more than 6,000 children and 4,000 women. The Gaza health ministry also says more than 300 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more wounded since the fighting resumed four days ago. Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, arrived in Gaza on Monday, where she said ""people's suffering is intolerable. """"I repeat our urgent call for civilians to be protected in line with the laws of war and for aid to enter unimpeded,"" she posted on X. The heightened concerns come as video posted to social media appears to show Israeli tanks and soldiers pushing farther south in pursuit of Hamas. NPR has not been able to independently verify these videos. On Oct. 7, the Palestinian Islamist militant group launched a surprise attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, Israel says. Israel responded with massive airstrikes and a ground invasion of Gaza. Over the weekend, Israel's military robocalled Palestinians in and around Gaza's second-largest city of Khan Younis, directing them to move to ""safer zones"" to avoid intensified combat operations. It was unclear how many Palestinians in Gaza received the calls on their cell phones or were able to make sense of the information. On Friday, Israel's military directed residents in Gaza to refer to an online map to find areas free of fighting. However, many found the map confusing or had trouble accessing it because of connectivity issues. The map also directed people into increasingly overcrowded areas, potentially exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. Ashraf Al Nahal, 43, took refuge in Khan Younis two weeks ago but says it's no longer safe there. ""They are bombing the area,"" he told NPR. He has since left, heading south near the border with Egypt. ""They are bombing houses,"" he said. ""We took the women and children and fled to Rafah. ""However, Israel was also carrying out airstrikes in areas of Rafah and the humanitarian situation was far from good, according to the U. N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). In its latest update, OCHA said the Rafah governorate ""was the one [area] in Gaza where limited aid distributions, primarily of flour and water, took place"" on Sunday. ""In the adjacent Khan Younis governorate, aid distribution largely stopped due to the intensity of hostilities,"" it said. UNRWA said that 1. 1 million internally displaced people — half of Gaza's total population — were registered in 156 U. N. facilities across Gaza. ""Another 191,000 [internally displaced persons] are estimated to be staying in 124 public schools and hospitals, as well as in other venues such as wedding halls, offices, and community centers. ""The agency warned that it has witnessed ""significant increases in some communicable diseases and conditions such as diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, skin infections and hygiene-related conditions like lice. There are also initial reports of disease outbreaks, including hepatitis A. ""In the first weeks of the war, Israeli forces concentrated combat operations on the north of the Gaza Strip, warning people living there to flee south. However, since the cease-fire collapsed on Friday, the focus of combat operations has increasingly shifted south. The effect has been to force civilians into an ever-smaller area of Gaza. On Sunday, Israel's military said it had destroyed more than 60% of the 800 Hamas tunnel shafts that it has identified since the start of the war. ""The tunnel shafts were located in civilian areas, many of which were near or inside civilian buildings and structures, such as schools, kindergartens, mosques and playgrounds,"" the military said. ""IDF soldiers located large quantities of weapons inside some of the shafts. These findings are further proof of how Hamas deliberately uses the civilian population and infrastructure as a cover for its terrorist activity inside Gaza.

174,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/03/1216138367/hamas-gaza-leader-yahya-sinwar,"TEL AVIV, Israel — The deadly Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, dragging Israeli hostages back to Gaza, and high-stakes negotiations for their release could not have happened without the approval of one secretive man. Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, is widely believed to have helped mastermind the unprecedented Hamas attack that changed the course of Israeli-Palestinian history. He spent more than two decades behind bars in Israel, before being freed 12 years ago in a hostage ransom deal his brother helped negotiate. In early October, Sinwar outsmarted Israel with the same hostage-taking tactic — resulting in Israel's deadliest day on record. Now Israel seeks to eradicate the Islamist militant group Sinwar leads in Gaza. Israel, the United States, Europe and others designate Hamas as a terrorist organization, but its surprise attack earned it widespread support among Palestinians, many of whom regard it as resisting decades of Israeli subjugation. Israel also vows to kill Sinwar, a short, wiry man with cropped white hair. Israeli leaders have deemed him a psychopath. Israelis and Palestinians presume Sinwar is hiding underground somewhere in Gaza, negotiating with world powers over hostage releases, trying to outmaneuver Israel, and surviving another day. Born on Oct. 29, 1962, according to Hamas, Sinwar helped found the group's internal security apparatus in the late 1980s. He earned a nickname among Palestinians: the butcher of Khan Younis, where he grew up in southern Gaza. His role in Hamas for years was to help root out suspected Palestinian informants for Israel. He was imprisoned in Israel on four life sentences, accused of playing a role in killing Israeli soldiers and Palestinian collaborators with Israel. ""He [has] so many secrets,"" says his former prison mate, Esmat Mansour, who now serves as a commentator of current affairs in Arabic-language media. Mansour recalls, Sinwar assembled a small team of confidants who would smuggle cellphones into prison, interrogate new prisoners about how they had been caught preparing an attack against Israel, and catch Palestinian inmates serving as informants for Israel. ""So many spies,"" Mansour says, speaking to NPR in the Palestinian city of Ramallah. In 2006, Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was captured by Hamas and held hostage in Gaza for five years. The man who guarded the captive soldier was none other than Sinwar's own brother, Mohammed. In 2011, Hamas freed the captive soldier in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Sinwar's brother made sure Sinwar was among them. ""All the prisoners [looked] at him as a man who can decide about their life,"" Mansour says. His VIP status in prison, and return to Gaza with the released prisoners, helped Sinwar rise in the ranks to lead Hamas in Gaza. Over the years, security-conscious Sinwar rarely appeared in public. But he did meet with the foreign press twice around periods of conflict with Israel. ""Your presence for us is a big accomplishment and asset for our people and our cause,"" he told the visiting journalists at a 2018 press conference in Gaza City that lasted two hours. At the time, Hamas was holding two Israeli citizens and the bodies of two killed Israeli soldiers. NPR asked Sinwar about the captives. Sinwar said it was a confidential file he wasn't prepared to talk about. Hamas is still holding them today. At the time, Hamas was encouraging violent protests along the Israeli border fence of the blockaded Gaza Strip. He said it was a strategy he learned from his hunger strikes in Israeli prison — he said Palestinians in Gaza were protesting their Israeli jailers for better conditions. The strategy seemed to work. Hamas and Israel, which do not speak directly to each other, reached an indirect arrangement known as ""quiet for quiet. "" Hamas agreed to cool hostilities and Israel agreed to ease Gaza's high unemployment rate, granting coveted Israeli work permits to thousands of laborers from the territory. A 2021 Hamas-Israel war interrupted that deal. Sinwar gave another press conference to foreign media after the war, denying that Hamas had routed international humanitarian aid to its clandestine effort to build underground tunnels for Hamas fighters. Israel's permits for workers from Gaza resumed, and surged to higher numbers, while fighting between Gaza and Israel ceased. The number of work permits Israel granted Gaza laborers, before the current war, surpassed 8,000. Eyal Hulata, who served as Israel's national security adviser last year, thought this strategy bought Israel some quiet on the Gaza border. ""I don't know. I thought we had an understanding what Sinwar's thinking was, and this was so wrong,"" Hulata told NPR in a recent briefing with journalists. Israel was shocked on Oct. 7, when Hamas fighters stormed the border, killed about 1,200 people and took back to Gaza more than 250 captives. David Meidan, the Israeli negotiator who, along with other officials, approved Sinwar's release from prison in the 2011 exchange of prisoners for one Israeli captive soldier, says Sinwar's strategy with the Oct. 7 attack was similar. ""First of all, to capture maximum hostages, and to use them as a tool to release his friends,"" Meidan says. Sinwar has not yet secured the release of his fellow prison mates with whom he spent years behind bars in Israel. But last week, Israel freed Palestinian women and minors jailed in recent weeks and years, in exchange for Hamas releasing some of its Israeli hostages. During that time, both sides agreed to a temporary cease-fire in the war. For every 10 hostages Hamas released per day, Israel extended the cease-fire another day and released 30 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Meidan said it helped Sinwar buy time. ""He needs time now,"" Meidan says. ""The time will help him to survive. ""Many Israelis worried that the pause in fighting would help Hamas fighters regroup, and leave more time for international pressure to mount against Israel resuming its military assault. But Israel renewed combat in Gaza on Friday, following a dispute over the kind of hostages Hamas offered to release and renewed Gaza rocket fire onto Israel. Sinwar will likely keep holding onto Israeli captive soldiers as a bargaining chip for his bigger goal: to secure the release of all Palestinian prisoners. Israel currently jails 7,677 Palestinian ""security"" inmates, according to the Israeli legal aid group HaMoked. ""We are ready to conduct an immediate prisoner exchange deal that includes the release of all Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails in exchange for all prisoners held by the Palestinian resistance,"" Sinwar said in an Oct. 28 statement. Opinion polls in October showed large Israeli support for such a comprehensive prisoner swap. ""When they end the war, they will make negotiations to release all the prisoners, and then it will be the biggest picture of victory in Palestinian history,"" says Mansour, Sinwar's former prison mate. After the last Israel-Hamas war in 2021, Sinwar dared Israel to assassinate him, and walked openly in the streets of Gaza. Today, as the 2023 war is not yet complete, Sinwar is on Israel's hit list. ""We will get to Yahya Sinwar, and we will assassinate him,"" said Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant last month, ""I say here, to the residents of Gaza, if you get (to him) before us, it will shorten the war.

175,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/03/1215798409/palestinian-journalists-killed-gaza-israel-hamas-war,"LONDON — ""This might be the last video I post,"" Ayat Khaddoura, a Palestinian journalist and podcaster, said in a post on Instagram Oct. 13. It was one of many videos Khaddoura had been sharing with her hundreds of thousands of followers on social media, talking about living under Israeli bombardment and trying to survive with limited water and electricity. On Nov. 6, in a video she called her ""last message to the world,"" she said: ""We used to have big dreams, but now our dream is only to be killed in one piece so people know who we are. "" A week later, she was dead. An Israeli airstrike on her home in northern Gaza killed her. The Committee to Protect Journalists says the Israel-Gaza war has ""led to the deadliest month for journalists"" since it started gathering data in 1992. Of 61 deaths of journalists and media workers CPJ has recorded as of Friday, 54 were Palestinian journalists, four were Israeli and three were Lebanese. By comparison, according to CPJ, a total of 68 journalists and media workers were killed worldwide in all of 2022. That total includes deaths in conflicts around the world, and those due to dangerous assignments, targeted killings and crossfire. The rising toll comes as the Israel-Hamas war enters its third month, and Israel continues its bombardment of the Gaza Strip, which has so far killed more than 13,300 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. Israel's offensive is in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials. Press freedom advocates have decried that journalists, even when they're visibly marked as press, are among the casualties in Gaza. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based nonprofit, says the majority of Gaza journalist casualties since the start of the war were killed while doing their jobs. The organization classifies 43 of the 50 journalists killed so far as being on a ""dangerous assignment. "" It says investigations into the circumstances of the deaths are ongoing and that it is investigating whether some were targeted attacks. ""The Israeli army is making choices and those choices to use lethal force against journalists and media facilities have to be warranted and proportional. Failing to do so constitutes possible war crimes,"" says Sherif Mansour, coordinator for the CPJ's Middle East program. Of those killed, 90% have been Palestinian journalists and media workers in Gaza. The organization says the four Israeli journalists were killed in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in Israel. It has confirmed that two of them were working at the time. The three Lebanese journalists were killed while on duty in Lebanon on the Israeli border, in what their respective organizations believe were targeted attacks. Al-Mayadeen TV journalist Farah Omar had given a live update an hour before she was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel's military denies targeting Palestinian or other journalists and says it tries to avoid civilian casualties. Gaza's journalists have shouldered the responsibility of telling the world what is happening while also suffering personal losses and tragedies during the war. Their task of newsgathering has been made more difficult by communication blackouts in Gaza, where phone and internet links have gone down periodically throughout the war. Palestinian officials blame Israel for severing lines and limiting fuel deliveries to power telecom towers and generators. Some Gaza journalists, including those working with international outlets, may receive support such as the provision of protective gear and equipment. Others who work on a freelance basis do not. Gaza-based journalists may also work for local outlets that are coming under bombardment themselves. But the risks are high for all in the besieged territory — most people in Gaza cannot get out. The Israeli military told Reuters and the Agence France-Presse that it could not guarantee the safety of their journalists operating in the Gaza Strip, after the news agencies had sought assurances that their journalists would not be targeted by Israeli strikes, Reuters reported. Nour Swirki, a freelance journalist who is currently living in a shelter in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, says it has become increasingly difficult to carry on reporting when fearing for her life and that of her family. She is a mother of two. ""I am playing two roles in this war: the professional one as a journalist, and as a mother. I'm terrified of losing myself as a civilian, as a journalist,"" she tells NPR in a voice message. ""I'm always thinking, what if something happens to my children. It's not an easy situation for us, as journalists, male and female, and as mothers and fathers. ""Salman al-Bashir, a journalist for the Palestinian Authority's TV channel, tore off his protective gear in the middle of a live broadcast when he found out his colleague, Mohammed Abu Hatab, had been killed in an Israeli airstrike. ""We are victims, live on air,"" he cried. ""It is only a matter of time until we are killed. We wait our turn, one after the other. ""Al Jazeera's Gaza correspondent Wael al-Dahdouh was broadcasting when he received the news that his family had been killed by an Israeli airstrike. His wife, son and daughter, grandson and at least eight other relatives were all killed in an Israeli attack on the home they had been sheltering in. Moments after he learned the news, the channel switched to footage of him, still wearing his press vest, kneeling over the body of his son. When he came back on air days later, he told viewers that despite his pain and ""open wound,"" he felt it was his duty to get back in front of the camera and carry on reporting. Hind Khoudary, a 28-year-old freelance journalist, says she feels disheartened that international correspondents were able to come in on embeds with the Israeli military when local reporters in Gaza had no information about what was happening to the homes and families they were forced to leave behind in the north of Gaza. Khoudary, like many others, fled her home in Gaza City after the Israeli military told people there to move south. Her house was destroyed by Israeli airstrikes. Communication blackouts have made it difficult for people in Gaza to know what is happening in other parts of the territory. ""I feel so sad seeing the Fox News and CNN correspondents, visiting Gaza and reporting about what's going on, when me and my colleagues who are Palestinian journalists, we have been here since day one,"" she says. ""We were forced to flee our homes, we don't know anything about what is happening in the north, we don't know anything about our families. We don't know what's bombed, what's not bombed, who's injured, who's killed, we literally know nothing,"" Khoudary says. Plestia Alaqad, a 22-year-old freelance Palestinian journalist, posted a photo of her press jacket on Instagram last week. ""I used to always wear my press vest and helmet. . . but lately I stopped wearing them,"" she wrote in an accompanying caption. ""I don't feel safe in Gaza no matter what . . . especially when wearing [the] press vest and helmet. """"I hope this nightmare ends soon, I hope we don't lose anymore journalists,"" she wrote. Alaqad has since left Gaza. She told her followers on social media that she left out of fears that her role as a journalist was putting herself and her family at greater risk. Before she left, Alaqad had been documenting the war in Gaza to her 4 million Instagram followers, who watched her flee her home, walk around her neighborhood after it was reduced to rubble and shelter in the dark during power blackouts. In most of her posts, she wore her protective press vest. Other Palestinian journalists also say they feel less safe wearing a press vest. They say they believe being identified as members of the press could make them and their families targets for Israeli forces. ""I don't feel safe at all with the press vest,"" Swirki tells NPR. ""As journalists here, it is considered part of the danger and risk, to wear this vest. ""She believes some of her colleagues have been targeted by Israel. ""There is no safe place at all in the Gaza Strip. And with these targets for our colleagues we know we aren't protected. We are facing death every single moment in the field,"" Swirki says. But the Committee to Protect Journalists says it has found evidence of the Israeli army targeting journalists in the past. It points to the case of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, who was shot dead last year while reporting in the occupied West Bank. Human rights groups and news outlets concluded after independent investigations that the Palestinian American journalist was killed in a targeted attack by Israeli troops. She was wearing a press vest at the time. The Israel Defense Forces later acknowledged the ""high possibility"" one of its soldiers shot Abu Akleh but said there wasn't evidence they intentionally targeted her. ""The IDF have not respected [press] insignia in the past,"" says Sherif Mansour, coordinator for the CPJ's Middle East program. A CPJ report published in May showed the majority of the journalists killed by the Israeli military in the past 22 years had press insignia showing on their bodies and their vehicles. ""What we have seen in this war is a deadly pattern becoming more deadly,"" Mansour says. He says it's a pattern that has wider implications for a war in which foreign press has largely been unable to report on what is going on in Gaza, and where there have been several communication blackouts. ""This pattern leaves Palestinian journalists in a precarious situation and leads to a chilling effect about covering IDF operations,"" says Mansour. Mansour says this makes the work of Palestinian journalists in Gaza all the more vital — and attacks on them all the more troubling for those trying to understand the conflict. ""Millions around the world rely on journalists to have accurate information and commentary,"" says Mansour. ""Without them, we end up with a sea of mis- and disinformation that can only fuel the conflict. """,npr_articles/article_175.txt,npr_results/article_175.txt.json
176,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/03/1216200754/gaza-heritage-sites-destroyed-israel,"In the weeks since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip have killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry, and destroyed thousands of homes in the territory. And there have also been tremendous losses to the region's ancient and globally significant cultural heritage. The region was a hub for commerce and culture under Egyptian, Greek, Roman and Byzantine rule. It remained influential for centuries thereafter. A recent survey by the group Heritage for Peace details the damage done so far to more than 100 of these landmarks in Gaza since the start of the present conflict. The casualties include the Great Omari Mosque, one of the most important and ancient mosques in historical Palestine; the Church of Saint Porphyrius, thought to be the third oldest church in the entire world; a 2,000-year-old Roman cemetery in northern Gaza excavated only last year; and the Rafah Museum, a space in southern Gaza which was dedicated to teaching about the territory's long and multi-layered heritage — until it was hammered by airstrikes early on in the conflict. Israel says it is pursuing Hamas in an effort to destroy it and to rescue hostages. It accuses Hamas of operating out of civilian areas, including hospitals and mosques. ""There were priceless items from coins, precious stones, copper plates, clothes,"" said Rafah Museum director Suhaila Shaheen, speaking in Arabic in a video interview posted on the museum's Facebook page amid the rubble of the destroyed space. Shards of white plaster littered the floor. The wall behind her had completely collapsed. ""The Museum of Rafah is in God's care now. ""In the Heritage for Peace report's introduction, the Catalonia-based nonprofit describes itself as maintaining ""a neutral stance, with our programs focused on empowering heritage specialists to confront unique challenges, such as safeguarding artifacts, sites, museums, and libraries during times of armed conflict. "" It added the survey was generated in response ""to the requests and desires of numerous concerned individuals, researchers, and local residents to shed light on the status of cultural heritage. """"If this heritage be no more in Gaza, it will be a big loss of the identity of the people in Gaza,"" said Isber Sabrine, president of Heritage for Peace, in an interview with NPR. Sabrine said his organization plans to continue the work of surveying and monitoring the status of cultural landmarks in Gaza over the coming months, both on the ground in collaboration with locals, as well as using satellite imagery. ""The people in Gaza, they have the right to keep and to save this heritage, to tell the history, the importance of this land,"" he said. The 1954 Hague Convention, agreed to by Palestinians and Israelis, is supposed to safeguard landmarks from the ravages of war. But landmarks in Gaza have been destroyed by Israeli strikes in earlier rounds of fighting. Dozens of sites, including the now-obliterated Great Omari Mosque, suffered damage in 2014. A report by UNESCO, the United Nations body that designates and protects World Heritage sites, cites further destruction to cultural and historic sites in Gaza in 2021. ""UNESCO is deeply concerned about the adverse impact of the ongoing fighting on cultural heritage in Palestine and Israel,"" said a UNESCO spokesperson in a statement sent to NPR. ""Our organization calls on all parties involved to strictly adhere to international law. Cultural property should not be targeted or used for military purposes, as it is considered to be civilian infrastructure. ""UNESCO has as yet been unable to survey the extent of the damage to the area's cultural heritage. ""Due to the ongoing fighting and the impossibility of accessing the area, UNESCO is not in a position to assess the damage itself on site,"" the agency's statement said. ""At this stage, our experts can only monitor the situation remotely, using satellite data and information transmitted to us by third parties. This information must then be scrupulously verified. ""The Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities did not respond to NPR's request to share information about the current status of Gaza's cultural heritage sites or salvaging plans. According to a report in The Art Newspaper, the ministry said it is ""at present unable to carry out a full assessment given the conditions on the ground. ""Israel's military did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment on the Heritage for Peace report. Locals are only now starting to take stock of the damage caused by the present fighting. ""When we move around Gaza, we feel very angry and very sad as well,"" said Gaza City Mayor Yahya al-Sarraj in a video report by Al Jazeera. ""We can discover now how much damage has been inflicted on the infrastructure of the city, on the cultural centers, on the main libraries of the city, and on the public.

177,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/03/1216382810/palestinian-prisoners-israel-hamas-war,"LONDON and RAMALLAH, Israeli-occupied West Bank — Rimah Shahada's living room is filled with deflated balloons. For the past week, she'd been preparing a homecoming celebration — with balloons, stuffed animals and welcome home cards — for her 17-year-old daughter, Aseel, who's been in an Israeli prison hospital since Nov. 11. Aseel was shot in the leg that day by Israeli soldiers, who said she lunged at them with scissors at a military checkpoint near the refugee camp where the Shahada family lives, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The teenager is one of thousands of people arrested in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, according to Israeli prison service figures, Palestinian officials and human rights groups. Many of them, like Shahada, are being held without charge or trial. Israel released about 240 Palestinian detainees and prisoners, in exchange for over 100 hostages freed by Hamas, as part of a weeklong truce that ended Friday. ""My hope's all gone now, sadly,"" says Rimah Shahada, 37. An NPR team had visited her home in the Qalandiya refugee camp near Ramallah last week, and reconnected with her by phone on Friday. ""We can't reach her, no one tells us anything about her,"" Shahada says of her daughter. ""And now they're hitting Gaza again. God be with the martyrs in Gaza. I hope this war ends. ""When Hamas militants stormed parts of southern Israel on Oct. 7, they killed about 1,200 people and took more than 240 hostages back to the Gaza Strip, according to Israeli officials. Since then, Israel's  bombardment and invasion of Gaza have killed more than 15,000 Palestinians there, according to health officials in Gaza. Both Hamas and Israel say a prime aim is to free the prisoners or captives held by the other side. After the past week's swaps, Israel estimates 137 hostages are still held in Gaza. The resumption of fighting between Israel and Hamas has dashed hopes of families like the Shahadas for the further release of the more than 10,000 Palestinians who remain in Israeli jails. Aseel Shahada's name had been published on an Israeli government database of Palestinian prisoners eligible for release as part of the temporary truce with Hamas — which gave her family hope that her release was imminent. But only about 240 of the 350 names published were released before the exchanges stopped Friday. Another woman from their refugee camp was among those released in the past week. Shahada's name was just after hers on the list. Her mother believes that if the truce had held for one more day, she would have been reunited with her daughter. ""The neighbor's daughter came out, but my daughter didn't,"" Rimah Shahada says. Shahada's family says the teenager was upset about the Gaza war, but denies she was ever violent. They say they don't know how she could have gotten a weapon on her way home from school that day. They haven't been able to talk to her since the incident. As of Friday, Israel was holding 7,677 Palestinians as what it deems security inmates, and another 2,873 Palestinians as administrative detainees — which means they can be held without charge, indefinitely. More than 1,500 of the arrests were made in November alone. These figures were sent to NPR by HaMoked, an Israeli nonprofit that offers legal aid to Palestinians living under occupation. It draws data directly from Israel's prison service. The top Palestinian official overseeing prisoners' affairs, Qadoura Fares, who belongs to the Fatah party, Hamas' rival, says more than 3,000 Palestinians have been arrested in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in total since Oct. 7. ""The majority of them, 90% of them, are victims — not prisoners,"" Fares told NPR in an interview last week at his office in Ramallah. He says most of them are minors accused of nonviolent offenses. ""These are people Israel has decided to arrest for endangering Israeli security — without clarifying why, how, with whom,"" Fares says. Fares accuses Israel of stepping up arrest raids during the latest Gaza war, in order to intimidate Palestinian communities and also have more detainees to negotiate with in prisoner exchanges. Israel acknowledges stepping up arrest raids. It says it's targeting members of Hamas and other militant groups in order to thwart future attacks — especially during a time of war. Hamas' ability to penetrate Israeli security — to kill and kidnap so many people on Oct. 7 — prompted many Israelis to ask whether militants had help from Palestinians elsewhere, including in the West Bank. Polls show wide support for Hamas in the West Bank, and there have been demonstrations there in support of the militant group.  The West Bank has been under Israeli military occupation since Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Mideast war. Under Israeli military law, Palestinian suspects can be held for up to eight days before seeing a judge — who can then classify them as administrative detainees, and extend their seizure indefinitely. Before this war, the United Nations and human rights groups had criticized the application of military law to Palestinian civilians. They've also criticized the uptick in Israeli arrest raids since the war began. ""The scale of detentions and arrests [of Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem] since the 7th of October, and those without charges or trial, is unprecedented,"" Budour Hassan, an Amnesty International researcher based in the West Bank, tells NPR. ""Palestinian detainees are telling us about humiliation and reprisals, even though they had nothing to do with the Oct. 7 attacks. It's a tactic of collective reprisal against all Palestinians. ""The prison figures show that out of a total of at least 10,550 Palestinians in Israeli custody, nearly 40% of them are held without charge. Many of them are accused of nonviolent offenses. Last month, Israel amended its counterterrorism law to make ""consumption of terrorist materials"" — reading or sharing content considered pro-Hamas online, for example — a new criminal offense. The law has been criticized by rights groups groups, including Article 19 and Adalah, as being ambiguous and far-reaching. ""It makes thoughts subject to criminal punishment . . . and criminalizes even passive social media use,"" the human rights group Adalah says. That's what happened to Ayah Jalal Mohammed Tamimi. The 20-year-old college student was arrested at her home in East Jerusalem on Oct. 9, two days after the Gaza war began, and accused of incitement — for a post on Instagram Stories, which quoted the Quran. (The post expired after 24 hours, so NPR was not able to verify Tamimi's account. She says it was simply a Quranic verse, posted without commentary. )Tamimi spent 50 nights in jail before being released Tuesday, as part of the now-halted nightly exchanges of hostages and prisoners that were part of the temporary Israel-Hamas truce. She was never charged, and wasn't allowed a phone call from jail — not to a lawyer or her family, she says. ""They gave us plain bread. But we were always hungry, and it was cold,"" Tamimi tells NPR by phone from her home in East Jerusalem. Last month, Israel's national security minister declared a three-month ""prison emergency,"" which allows for prisoners to be given floor mattresses, rather than beds. The text of the declaration says that ""many more detainees are expected to be absorbed in the near future in view of the state of war. "" Another freed prisoner, 17-year-old Malik Mohammed Arafat Deeba, says he felt that change. Israeli prison conditions worsened after the war broke out, he says. Deeba was arrested in his East Jerusalem neighborhood last summer for stone-throwing — something he denies. He too was never charged, but was jailed for five months, before being released Tuesday as part of the now-halted truce. ""After the war began, the food got really bad, and they didn't give us enough of it,"" Deeba tells NPR by phone. ""We were treated terribly. They cut us off from the world, we had no way of contacting our families. ""His mother, Nihal Deeba, tells NPR she had been allowed to visit her son in jail until Oct. 7, when such visits were halted. She has another son, Arafat, age 20, who remains in Israeli custody. She'd been hoping the truce would last longer, and that he too might be freed. ""These are our children, our brothers and sisters,"" Nihal Deeba says. ""I pray that all the prisoners are freed, and that the prisons are emptied. ""Most of the Palestinians freed during the past week's exchanges were teenage boys. They also included several teenage girls and several dozen adult women. The gender of some of them is unclear, because their names could be male or female. Most of them are listed as being from the West Bank and Jerusalem. None had been convicted of murder. Some have been accused or convicted of violence, including stabbings that injured Israeli security officers or civilians. Other offenses include stone-throwing, incitement and membership in what Israel considers a terrorist group. Before the releases, Israel published lists of names of jailed Palestinians who were eligible to be part of the exchanges. It allowed Israeli citizens to petition their Supreme Court if they objected to any of the names. Some groups representing victims of terrorist attacks said they planned to appeal some names. But the court historically has not intervened to block such releases, and it did not do so this week. Among some 30 Palestinians released Wednesday night was Ahed Tamimi, now 22, who as a teenager became a symbol of Palestinian defiance to military occupation. In 2017, a video went viral showing Tamimi slapping and kicking Israeli soldiers in her home village in the West Bank. She pleaded guilty to assault charges, and has been in and out of Israeli prison since then. (Ahed Tamimi has no relation to Ayah Jalal Mohammed Tamimi. ) Ahed Tamimi had been arrested again last month, this time for an Instagram post. Israeli media say the post referred to Adolf Hitler and contained threats to ""slaughter"" Jews. Her family says there are dozens of fake accounts under Tamimi's name, and that she did not post the message in question. The account it was posted on, which carried Tamimi's name and photo, has since been deleted. On her release, Tamimi told reporters that her Israeli jailers had threatened to hurt her family — including her father, who remains in another Israeli prison — if she spoke out about conditions in jail. She said there was little food or water, and that she had been forced to sleep on the prison floor. Rimah Shahada fears the conditions her 17-year-old Aseel is enduring in an Israeli prison hospital. She says she has no information about her daughter's condition. But she says she has a feeling that somehow she'll see her daughter again. ""I hope all the detainees are released, and bring joy to their parents,"" Shahada says. Her younger children, along with their cousins, have been making beaded friendship bracelets to give to Aseel upon her return. ""Praise be to God, I'm staying patient,"" their mother says.

178,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/02/1216719613/harris-dubai-climate-gaza-young-voters,"DUBAI — Vice President Harris on Saturday told leaders gathered at a United Nations summit that they should take a cue from young activists and do more to curb climate change. It was one of several explicit nods Harris made to young voters — a key segment of support for the Biden-Harris ticket in 2020 — who have expressed disappointment with the administration's climate record leading up to the 2024 presidential election. Young voters have also expressed disapproval of President Biden's full-throated support for Israel as it fights Hamas in Gaza after the Oct. 7 attacks. Polls show young voters are more likely than older voters to sympathize with Palestinians than Israel, and think Israel's response in Gaza has gone too far. Making her most extensive comments to date on the conflict, Harris said Israel had the right to ""eliminate the threat of Hamas"" but she also repeatedly said Israel needed to do more to protect civilians in Gaza. ""Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering and the images and videos coming from Gaza are devastating,"" she said, noting that she had spoken with members of the Palestinian, Arab and Muslim communities in the United States. Her remarks aligned with those made by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Saturday morning. Speaking at a national defense forum in Simi Valley, Calif. , Austin warned Israel's leaders that if they don't protect civilians in Gaza, they could win the battle but lose the war: ""You see, in this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population. And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat. ""Harris was in Dubai as fighting in Gaza resumed after a five-day temporary truce collapsed. She met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, King Abdullah of Jordan and UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed on the sidelines of the COP28 meeting — and spoke by phone to Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. Officials said she called the emir after hearing that talks had broken down about a renewed pause in fighting. Harris said her goal was to build regional consensus and accelerate plans for Gaza after the fighting stops, citing five principles guiding the U. S. approach: ""No forcible displacement, no reoccupation, no siege or blockade, no reduction in territory, and no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism,"" she said. She said that the international community needed to pour resources into rebuilding hospitals, housing and infrastructure in Gaza – and reiterated that the United States wants to see Gaza and West Bank unified and governed by a ""transparent, responsive"" government led by a strengthened Palestinian Authority. Leading up to the election, now less than a year away, Harris has been dispatched to speak to college campuses to try to get young voters excited about President Biden's track record. Young voters were a key bloc of support for the Biden-Harris ticket in the 2020 election, but their enthusiasm has since sagged. Climate is a key concern for many younger voters. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll from this summer found that nearly 6 in 10 millennial and Gen Z Americans believe addressing climate change should be a priority even at the risk of slowing economic growth. Polling shows approval for Biden's handling of climate change has declined in spite of the investments in his landmark Inflation Reduction Act, particularly with young voters. The president has faced backlash over a decision earlier this year to approve a large drilling project known as Willow on federal land in Alaska, and some young voters would like to see Biden declare a climate emergency to give him more power to tackle the issue. Harris' trip to Dubai to COP28 was hastily organized after the White House said President Biden would not attend the summit. On climate, Harris pointed to spending that the Biden administration has already committed, and rolled out a new $3 billion pledge to the UN's Green Climate Fund to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change. The pledge will require funding from Congress, which is not easy to come by. She praised young activists for their passion on the issue. ""They understand the urgency of this moment, and they fight with conviction, knowing we still have time to make a difference. So let us all share in their sense of urgency and their optimism. Let us all lead then with ambition and conviction,"" Harris said.",npr_articles/article_178.txt,npr_results/article_178.txt.json
179,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/02/1216705856/hamas-israel-palestinians-gaza-war-ceasefire,"TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military says it attacked more than 400 targets throughout Gaza in the 24 hours since the end of a week-long cease-fire with Hamas sparked a resumption of combat operations. The Israel Defense Forces released video and photos of Israeli soldiers conducting ground operations and aerial footage showing airstrikes on buildings and infrastructure. One video, that appeared to target a human figure walking in a street, was described by the IDF as ""a strike on terrorists"" in western Jabalia, an area in Gaza's north. In a statement, the IDF said that air force fighter jets had struck more than 50 targets around Khan Younis, a city in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. The heavy bombardment and ground operations across Gaza killed nearly 200 Palestinians and wounded hundreds more in the first day of resumed fighting, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza. The temporary truce that collapsed early Friday followed seven weeks of fighting in Gaza sparked by simultaneous attacks on southern Israel by Hamas militants on Oct. 7. The attacks killed 1,200 people, Israel says. The militants also seized around 240 captives, more than 100 of whom were subsequently freed in a series of hostages-for-prisoners swaps during the cease-fire. Israel released nearly 250 Palestinian prisoners and detainees as part of the deal. Vice President Harris told reporters on Saturday that Israel must do more to protect civilians in Gaza. Speaking in Dubai, the site of the COP28 climate summit, She said Israel had a right to ""eliminate the threat of Hamas"" after the Oct. 7 attack, but she emphasized that ""it matters how. "" ""Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering and the images and videos coming from Gaza are devastating,"" she said. ""We believe Israel must do more to protect innocent civilians,"" Harris said. The pause in fighting and exchange of captives — an agreement originally slated to last four days — was extended another three days to facilitate more hostages-for-prisoners swaps. Earlier this week, CIA Director William Burns and David Barnea, the chief of Israel's spy agency, Mossad, held talks with Egypt Intelligence Minister Gen. Abbas Kamel and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani in Qatar on the possibility of further extending the cease-fire. There was some hope that the deal could be revived even after the resumption of hostilities in Gaza. However, on Saturday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement saying that Barnea had ""ordered his team in Doha to return to Israel. "" It added that Hamas ""did not fulfill its part of the agreement, which included the release of all children and women according to a list that was forwarded to Hamas and approved by it. """"The head of the Mossad thanks the head of the CIA, the Egyptian Minister of Intelligence and the Prime Minister of Qatar for their partnership in the tremendous mediation efforts that led to the release of 84 children and women from the Gaza Strip in addition to 24 foreign citizens,"" the statement said. Harris declined to comment on details of talks to free more hostages. Israel has notified at least five Israeli families that their loved ones taken hostage by Hamas are no longer alive. More than 100 others remain in captivity, according to Israel's military. A United Nations official tells NPR that about 50 aid trucks managed to enter Gaza via a border crossing with Egypt and were waiting to be unloaded Saturday morning. However, the vehicles did not reach Gaza's hardest-hit north. The number of trucks delivering aid on Friday was also far fewer than the around 200 per day during the week-long pause in fighting — a number that relief officials have said is far too small to meet the needs of Gaza's 2. 2 million people. Even so, a senior official of the U. N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the cease-fire ""offered a glimpse of what can happen when the guns fall silent. """"We need to maintain – and build on – the progress in aid delivery,"" Martin Griffiths, OCHA's under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, said. ""We need civilians and the life-sustaining infrastructure they rely on to be protected. We need the remaining hostages to be released immediately and unconditionally. We need a humanitarian ceasefire. We need the fighting to stop. ""Amid what international groups have described as a growing humanitarian crisis in besieged Gaza, Israel says it will not renew the visa of the top U. N. aid official for the Palestinian territories. Nearly three years ago, Canadian-born Lynn Hastings was named deputy special envoy for the Middle East peace process and the resident coordinator for the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But a spokesman for U. N. Secretary-General António Guterres said on Friday that the U. N. had been informed by Israeli authorities ""that they would not renew the visa of Miss Hastings past its due date at some point later this month,"" according to Israeli media. In a statement to NPR, Israel's foreign ministry confirmed that Hastings' visa would not be renewed. Citing what it calls the U. N. 's ""one-sided and biased attitude"" in the conflict in Gaza, the foreign ministry said it had decided ""not to automatically approve the granting of visas to U. N. representatives in Israel and to examine each case individually. """,npr_articles/article_179.txt,npr_results/article_179.txt.json
180,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/02/1216210180/israeli-gaza-hostages-recovery,"Hamas has released over 100 of the more than 240 people it kidnapped from Israel on Oct. 7 as part of a hostage and prisoner exchange enabled by the weeklong cease-fire that ended on Friday. Those freed in Gaza were mostly women and children, including some foreign nationals. At the same time, hundreds of Arab residents of the West Bank who had been held in prisons by Israel have been freed. This has created two sets of populations, including many children, in need of psychological support as they return to freedom. In Israel, as the freed hostages return home, Israeli and U. S. media have been awash with photos and videos of their emotional reunions with surviving loved ones (including some pets) as well as emerging details about their nearly two months in captivity. Most hostages have not spoken with the media directly, though accounts from family members suggest at least some were given limited access to food, beds, bathrooms and medications. One 84-year-old woman was returned to Israel over the weekend in critical condition.  Some families say their relatives lost weight and came home with head lice. One man said his aunt had to readjust to sunlight after spending so much time in a tunnel. The families of two young girls said they only spoke in whispers upon their arrival because they had been told not to make noise in captivity. Family members of several hostages of all ages described them as physically but not mentally OK in interviews with NPR. Many are returning home to learn that their loved ones were killed on Oct. 7 or are still being held in Gaza. For many, feelings of relief are mixed with those of guilt and exhaustion. And relatives and experts have voiced concern about the potential long-term effects of the ordeal on hostages, particularly young children. That's what the family of four-year-old Abigail Idan — a dual American-Israeli citizen whose parents were among the some 1,200 people killed on Oct. 7 — told NPR. Her great-aunt Liz Hirsh Naftali said Idan is ""overjoyed"" to be back with her siblings, but declined to elaborate on her condition. ""I think that we will only learn as the days go on, and for a long time, what really effectively will be the results of having been a hostage and having been in her father's arms when he was murdered,"" Hirsh Naftali said. Experts told NPR that the road to recovery from such an experience can be long, but there are steps that caregivers, loved ones and professionals can take to help children who were held hostage navigate a path forward. In anticipation of the release of hostages, Israel's health ministry worked with child trauma specialists to come up with a handbook for how people should interact with them. Ayelet Noam-Rosenthal, a social worker at the Haruv Institute in Jerusalem and one of the authors of the guide, says it includes protocols for ""everyone that will meet the child,"" from parents to pediatricians to teachers. ""Here in Israel after the horrific events of Oct. 7, where children were kidnapped after witnessing massacre and severe violence, we actually understood that we have to focus also on the day after,"" she told NPR. ""That means the day after they return, and address both their immediate and long-term needs. "" The Times of Israel reports that the new protocols cover best practices for both the hours and weeks after hostages are released. It has instructions for the Israeli soldiers accompanying children on their way to the hospital, including how to introduce themselves and how to answer (or deflect) their questions, CNN reported. Hostages are to be brought to one of six Israeli hospitals, where they can reunite with family members and receive a suitcase with some of their clothing, medications and personal items. They also receive a thorough medical exam, which the Times reports must be performed by female doctors. The guide says those exams should check for evidence of rape or torture, and that if any is found, ""appropriate professionals"" should be consulted on whether it would be possible collect the evidence or interview the patient without re-traumatizing them. There is also guidance on proper nutrition and avoiding potentially-fatal refeeding syndrome, which can happen when food is reintroduced to a malnourished person. Liz Cathcart, the executive director of the nonprofit Hostage U. S. (which supports families of Americans taken hostage but cannot comment on which cases it is working on) says malnutrition is common among hostages. That could be due to a lack of nutritious food and food in general or the inability to keep food down because of stress. Other potential issues include vitamin deficiencies, diseases contracted in captivity and sleep disturbances, according to Hostage U. S.  The physical health of the hostages is the immediate priority, Cathcart tells NPR. ""Without the physical health checks and making sure that your physical health is up to par, you're not able to then take the next steps to recovery and reintegration,"" she says. Noam-Rosenthal says parents and professionals should take every precaution to avoid re-traumatizing children who were held captive. ""We must all work together to strengthen the child's resilience and work toward his or her adjustment to the new circumstances,"" she says.  For instance, the Times reports that while doctors can evaluate whether adults are healthy enough to recount their experience to law enforcement, the ""debriefing of children will be delayed for some time. "" Noam-Rosenthal says it's crucial to rebuild trust ""because that's one of the things these children lost along the way. ""One of the first things her team tells family members is that they need to give children their autonomy back — for example, letting them set the pace for physical touch, even if the parents are desperate to hug them immediately. Longer-term, she says it's important for parents and professionals to work together in support of the child's well-being. She called for full coordination of ""the military, the health and the social services as one system driven by the same goal. "" Building resilience and coping skills are key to helping former captives adjust to their new normal, Cathcart says. And it's not just the hostages themselves who need help. Families of hostages are coming off a ""two-month marathon"" of worrying about and fighting for their loved ones' release, Cathcart says. Before they can shift their focus to that person's recovery, she says, they need to take care of themselves too. ""What I always encourage families to do when their loved one gets home is to focus on yourself, too, because it's so important that the families are mentally healthy, that they're fed, that they have energy,"" she adds. ""Because if they don't, they're not going to be able to support their family member. "" Hostage U. S. recommends that hostages and their families work to ""establish a routine without being regimented,"" think through potential triggers (like loud noises or dark rooms), communicate openly and be patient throughout the reintegration process. ""The use of simple words and short sentences is important,"" the ministry advises, according to CNN. ""It is important to convey that we are open and able to hear and talk about difficult things. "" As part of the temporary truce, Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners, many of whom are minors. Prior to Oct. 7, some 500-700 Palestinian children were subjected to Israeli military detention every year, in some cases without charge, trial or due process guarantees, according to Save the Children. The organization welcomed the release of both Israeli and Palestinian children as part of the deal. But Jason Lee, Save the Children's country director in the Palestinian Territories, called it ""just the first step needed"" in addressing a decades-old crisis affecting children in the region. ""A lasting ceasefire must be agreed immediately, all hostages in Gaza must be released, and the appalling emotional and physical abuse of Palestinian children in detention must end,"" he added. More than 13,300 Palestinians — roughly two-thirds of them women and minors — have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza. The count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.  The United Nations has warned that Gaza is becoming a ""graveyard for children,"" while the World Health Organization has raised alarms about the spread of infectious diseases in the territory. And researchers are worried about the toll the war will take on the mental health and development of the children who do survive. Studies conducted before the current conflict documented especially high rates of mental and behavioral health issues among Gaza's youth, who make up nearly half of its population.

181,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/02/1216561517/gaza-humanitarian-aid-ceasefire-airstrikes," TEL AVIV, Israel — For seven days, the people of Gaza could stand in long lines waiting for water, cooking gas and bread, without fear of an incoming airstrike. Hospitals could treat the injured without worrying about new strikes sending additional patients their way. Aid groups delivered tens of thousands of tons of aid across the territory, including in Gaza's north, where fighting had been too intense to safely distribute it.  But on Friday, a week-long ceasefire — brokered to allow the exchange of Hamas-held hostages and Israeli-held Palestinian detainees — came to an end after both sides accused the other of violating the terms of the truce. So too did aid groups' hopes of a longer-term pause to address the worsening humanitarian situation for the 2. 3 million residents of Gaza, about 80% of whom are estimated to be displaced from their homes. ""This is a man-made catastrophe. It looks like an earthquake, a famine and a massive epidemic,"" said Dr. Margaret Harris, a spokesperson for the World Health Organization, in an interview with NPR before the fighting resumed. ""The only logical answer is a true ceasefire. ""The week-long pause in fighting had allowed the delivery of thousands of tons of food and water, nearly 150 tons of medical supplies and roughly 30,000 liters of fuel to shelters operated by the United Nations in the north of Gaza, the U. N. said. Ambulances ferried critically wounded patients to Egypt. The break in fighting also allowed several hospitals in northern Gaza to re-open for limited services. Officials in Gaza warned that the open hospitals would be unable to receive large numbers of wounded once fighting resumed. Nearly 20 other hospitals remained closed. Even in the south of Gaza, where some fuel and medical supplies have been more frequently delivered, medical facilities remained overwhelmed, hospital staff told NPR. ""The condition at this hospital is so bad because we are loading everything on our shoulders,"" said Dr. Mohamed Yasouri, an emergency room physician at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. ""We can save life or save organs if we have enough medical equipment,"" he added — but they don't. But the pause did little to improve access to water for northern Gaza. A lack of fuel and damage to infrastructure kept water production facilities shut, humanitarian groups reported, leaving small U. N. - or privately-operated wells as the primary sources of potable water in the north. And the supply of other critical goods — like cooking gas — remained limited. Before the pause, about 20 trucks of aid were being delivered into Gaza each day via the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. But aid organizations, including the U. N. , reported that no humanitarian aid had been allowed into the territory Friday. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society, a humanitarian group, said Friday that Israeli forces had told aid groups that the entry of aid trucks from Rafah would be ""prohibited, starting from today until further notice. "" ""This decision exacerbates the suffering of citizens and increases the challenges facing humanitarian and relief organizations in alleviating the hardships of citizens and displaced persons due to the ongoing aggression on the Gaza Strip,"" the group said. In response, Israeli officials said that trucks would be allowed into Gaza. The White House was also optimistic that a flow of aid would begin again, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Friday, though ""probably in terms of dozens of trucks, versus hundreds of trucks,"" he added. As many as 1. 8 million Palestinians are thought to be internally displaced since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel that left 1,200 dead, according to Israeli officials. In the weeks since the attack, the Israeli offensive in Gaza has resulted in at least 13,300 deaths, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and led aid groups to warn that overcrowding and deteriorating sanitary conditions are heightening the risk of infectious disease. More than a million people are registered with shelters run by UNRWA, the U. N. aid agency for Palestinian refugees. The shelters are designed to accommodate 1,500 people each, but currently there are, on average, about 6,000 at each one, U. N. officials say. At one UNRWA school-turned-shelter, officials reported an outbreak of hepatitis A. ""To give you an example, we're averaging 125 people using one toilet. So basic things like sanitation in these shelters is very difficult. People are jammed into very congested classrooms in the evenings,"" said Thomas White, the director of UNRWA in Gaza, in an interview with the BBC. This week, the World Health Organization warned that untreated disease could ultimately kill more people in Gaza than bombings if the territory's health infrastructure is not restored. Officials report tens of thousands of cases of respiratory infections, diarrhea and skin rash — and attributed the outbreaks to overcrowding, a lack of food, water, sanitation and basic hygiene and challenges with waste management.  ""We need a ceasefire. A ceasefire that holds,"" WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Friday after the airstrikes resumed. By sundown, hundreds of strikes hit targets across Gaza, including in the south, the Israeli military reported. The Gaza Ministry of Health said nearly 180 people were killed and nearly 600 others injured. Shaimaa Ahmed, 20, a computer engineering student sheltering in central Gaza, told NPR on Friday that the renewed fighting felt ""suffocating. "" ""We really thought we couldn't bear it anymore if this thing started again. We've already seen enough. We've already gone through enough,"" Ahmed said. ""But apparently it wasn't enough for them.

182,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/01/1216135606/israel-rave-music-memorial-hamas-attack,"RE'IM, Israel — In a small clearing in a eucalyptus forest, a lone DJ on a stage blasts out pulsing electronic music that punctuates the otherwise quiet landscape. There are no concertgoers. His crowd is a sea of poster-board faces atop poles. These are the faces of the 364 young people killed by Hamas-led militants last month in an attack on a rave party in Israel's Negev Desert. There are also pictures of dozens of people Hamas seized as hostages that same day. The memorial event took place Tuesday at the exact spot of the Nova festival massacre, to commemorate those whose lives were cut short and upended on Oct. 7, when Hamas killed 1,200 people and took more than 240 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. ""It's just our small way to tell the world what happened here,"" says Ilana Frenkel, one of the event's organizers. ""The size of the horror is more than anyone can imagine. This is the beginning of explaining how horrible it was. ""Armed Israeli soldiers mill about. The scores of charred cars that were set afire during the attack have all been hauled away, and the burnt road is being repaved. But there are still a few mangled beach chairs and broken coolers lying in the surrounding fields and eucalyptus forest. The memorial event, held a couple of miles from the Gaza Strip, was hastily put together as the Israeli army only gave clearance a few days earlier. Five well-known Israeli DJs played music throughout the day, while pictures of the Oct. 7 attack victims were projected on screens. Asher Swissa, whose DJ name is Skazi, opened the event. ""This was not only a massacre of people,"" he says. ""It was a massacre of music, of freedom, of something much more bigger than us. ""Swissa, a trance producer with a global following, was out of the country on Oct. 7. But he says it was extremely important to be here now for the memorial. ""I'd say I played many festivals in my life — including internationally. I've been all over the world. But I never felt what I feel here in this moment. I feel sadness,"" he says. ""Deep sadness. ""Swissa says Israel is known the world over for its rave events and what's called psytrance, or psychedelic trance, music. The Nova rave party is held every year in different venues around Israel. Swissa hadn't been sure how he would open the tribute, but says he knew as soon as he got here. ""Im Nin'alu"" is one of his most famous mixes that he recorded with artist Mor Avrahami. Based on a Hebrew poem written by a 17th century Yemeni rabbi, Swissa says the song was fitting for a place where so many people were killed. The memorial rave lasted throughout the day, giving anyone who wished the opportunity to come. Thirty-one-year-old Bar Markos showed up with his twin brother, Dor. They were among the ravers who escaped on Oct. 7. ""This is holy ground for us,"" Bar Markos says. ""We came back to close the circle. ""Markos says Hamas blocked the the road out on the day of the attack. The brothers escaped in their car on other dirt roads, and planned to leave the memorial the same way, to get some closure. He says this is the first time he's listened to music since the attack. ""And this is the first time I've been able to cry,"" he says. ""The music is bringing it out. ""Joss Aviv, 24, another of the event's organizers, says from now on, there will always be the Israel that existed before Oct. 7 and the Israel after. ""This impacts everything,"" he says, ""your trust, and your sense of security. This is the 9/11 of Israel. Everything is compromised. So we're in that shock and revival stage.

183,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/01/1216333362/israel-hamas-ceasefire-combat-gaza-hostages,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel's warplanes began pounding targets in Gaza early Friday, shortly after the collapse of a cease-fire deal that had allowed the release of more than 100 hostages seized by Hamas militants and nearly 250 Palestinians from Israeli jails. By mid-afternoon, Israel had already launched more than 200 airstrikes across the territory, the Israeli military said, including in Rafah and Khan Younis, the south's two largest cities where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from the north have sought shelter. Health officials in Gaza reported 178 deaths and nearly 600 injuries in the renewed bombardment Friday. Airstrikes in Rafah, near the Egyptian border, began just after 7 a. m. local time. One struck an apartment building near an open market. Five-year-old Joury Miqdad, who woke up in the morning and went to play with her cousin, was killed in the Rafah strike, the girl's father, Ramadan Miqdad, told NPR. Her cousin was injured. Joury's mother, Fadwa Miqdad, cried aloud for her daughter. ""My beloved, it was going to be your birthday, I was going to make a cake for you,"" she said. The end of the truce and the resumption of fighting came hours after a seventh hostages-for-prisoners exchange between the two sides, and just as U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was leaving Israel after high-level meetings, including with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Blinken had pressed Israel to further extend the temporary truce. Israel's military said it was restarting combat operations because Hamas ""violated the operational pause . . . and fired toward Israeli territory. "" Netanyahu's office added that Hamas ""did not live up to its duty to release all the kidnapped women today, and launched rockets at the citizens of Israel. """"With the return to fighting we will emphasize: the Israeli government is committed to achieving the goals of the war — to release our hostages, eliminate Hamas and ensure that Gaza will never again pose a threat to the residents of Israel,"" the prime minister's office said. Later in the day, in a post on X (formerly Twitter), Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said he'd flown over Gaza in a helicopter and  ""watched the wave of attacks by the Air Force up close,"" adding that ""the results are impressive. ""Hamas in a statement issued Friday afternoon local time said Israel ""bears full responsibility"" for the breakdown of the cease-fire. In all-night negotiations, the Islamist militant group said it ""offered to exchange prisoners and the elderly (and) . . . offered to hand over the bodies of those killed and detained as a result of the Israeli bombing. ""Hamas referred by name to one family of captives. Earlier, Hamas had said Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel has said it is assessing whether or not they are dead. Videos from Oct. 7 showed the family, including father Yarden, was alive when they were taken into Gaza. In its statement, Hamas said it had ""also offered to hand over the bodies of the Bibas family and release their father, so that he could [participate] in their burial ceremonies,"" in addition to handing over two other Israeli captives. It said Israel had ""refused to deal with all these offers. ""Hamas also said the Biden administration bears ""full responsibility for the continuation of Zionist war crimes in the Gaza Strip, after its absolute support for it,"" and after what it said was Blinken's ""green light"" for Israel to resume the war. Blinken, speaking on a stop in Dubai, said in his discussions in Israel, he'd focused on trying to secure the release of hostages, increasing humanitarian aid to Gaza, and discussing how Israel can make sure Hamas ""never again has the ability to do what it did on October 7th. ""  Blinken said the pause came to an end because ""Hamas reneged on commitments it made. "" Referring to an attack at a bus stop outside Jerusalem on Thursday, Blinken called it ""an atrocious terrorist attack"" that killed three people, and wounded others, including Americans. He also said Hamas ""began firing rockets before the pause had ended"" and ""reneged on commitments it made in terms of releasing certain hostages. ""Earlier on Friday, a spokesman for the foreign ministry in Qatar, where the temporary cease-fire was negotiated, said the Gulf state was ""deeply saddened"" by the collapse of the deal, but confirmed that talks were ongoing ""with the aim of a return to a pause. ""Qatar said Israel's renewed strikes on Gaza ""complicates mediation efforts and exacerbates the humanitarian catastrophe in the Strip. ""The temporary cease-fire, which began a week ago, came after weeks of heavy bombardment by Israeli air and ground forces in response to an Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, Israel says. Some 240 hostages, including Israelis and a number of foreign workers, were also seized from communities bordering Gaza. After hostilities resumed, Israel's military issued a warning to Palestinians in Gaza that ""Hamas uses the residents of the Gaza Strip as human shields, placing its command and military infrastructure in residential areas, hospitals, mosques, and schools. """"Hamas turns civilian sites into military targets while using civilians and civilian facilities as a human shield,"" the military said, issuing what it said was an interactive evacuation map for residents that it says shows safe evacuation areas. However, many Gaza residents have been without electricity or an internet connection for weeks and the map is difficult to navigate on a cell phone. Israeli planes dropped leaflets over Khan Younis, warning that the city is a dangerous combat zone. It said residents should move to Rafah, about 6 miles to the south. During the week-long pause in fighting, Hamas and other militants in Gaza released more than 100 hostages, most of them Israelis, in return for 240 Palestinians freed from prisons in Israel. The truce also allowed desperately needed humanitarian aid to reach besieged Gaza, whose 2. 2 million people had been under weeks of bombardment from Israeli airstrikes and a ground campaign that has killed at least 13,300 people, according to Gaza's health ministry. Expressing ""deep regret"" that military operations had restarted in Gaza, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said in a post on X that he still hopes ""that it will be possible to renew the pause that was established. The return to hostilities only shows how important it is to have a true humanitarian ceasefire. ""The original four-day cease-fire deal that began a week ago was twice extended for a total of three days to allow for the exchange of more captives. Israel had agreed to prolong the truce if Hamas turned over an additional 10 hostages per day in exchange for 30 Palestinians. But on Thursday, in the final exchange under the extension, Hamas released only eight captives. As Israelis woke up to the news that the war was back on, hundreds of people gathered in a square in central Tel Aviv where the families of hostages and their supporters have kept vigil since the crisis began. Some families of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas voiced sorrow on Friday at the resumption of fighting. ""I feel very bad about the whole issue,"" said Yoav Shelhav, from the Nahal Oz kibbutz, where two residents were abducted in the Hamas attack eight weeks ago. Two men from the kibbutz, Omri Miran and Tzahi Idan, remain in captivity. Shelhav said Idan is a distant cousin of his. ""I think our main concern should be getting back not just these two guys, but everyone. "" he said. ""I think this should be the first priority. The issue with Hamas is important, it should be resolved, but it can be second priority. ""Shelhav said he remains hopeful more hostages will eventually be freed: ""I have no actual idea of them, if they are still alive or not, but I have hope. ""Nihal Deeba lives in East Jerusalem, part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

184,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/30/1215998728/israel-hamas-jerusalem-attack-hostages-captives-extension-ceasefire,"TEL AVIV, Israel — As the seventh day of the temporary Israel-Hamas truce came to a close, Israel indicated it would support another extension in order to allow for the release of more hostages, and U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Israel to take ""more effective steps"" to protect civilian life. Six more hostages — five women and one man — were released by Hamas late Thursday and some 30 Palestinian prisoners and detainees were expected to be freed from Israeli prisons, marking the seventh consecutive day of hostage-prisoner exchanges with the militant group Hamas. In total, about 240 hostages were captured by Hamas fighters in the Oct. 7 attack launched from Gaza on Israeli border communities that killed about 1,200 people, Israel says. About 140 hostages are thought to remain in captivity. If an agreement to extend the truce could not be reached, Israeli troops stand by to resume fighting, military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in remarks to the media. ""We are prepared for an attack at any hour,"" he said. Earlier Thursday, Hamas released two hostages outside of the framework of the swap. Both are women and one has dual French-Israeli citizenship. The latest discussions to prolong the truce that has temporarily halted Israel's bombardment of Gaza coincided with Blinken's arrival in Israel to push for a more permanent resolution to the conflict. After a meeting with Netanyahu and other senior Israeli officials, Blinken told reporters that Israel must put in place plans to minimize further casualties of innocent Palestinians before resuming military operations in Gaza. ""That means taking more effective steps to protect the lives of civilians,"" he said. ""Intent is obviously where you start, and it's vitally important,"" Blinken said. ""But results, of course, are fundamentally what matters. ""Blinken urged Israel to indicate safe areas in central and southern Gaza, to avoid further displacement of civilians, and to avoid damage to life-critical infrastructure like hospitals, power stations and water facilities. Civilians who evacuated to southern Gaza must also be given an opportunity to return home once it is safe to do so, Blinken said. ""There must be no enduring internal displacement,"" he said. Netanyahu has repeatedly said that Israeli forces will resume operations to ""crush Hamas"" once the truce expires. Earlier Thursday, Blinken met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who thanked the U. S. ""for the immense work it is devoting to the release of the hostages. "" He also mentioned by name the Bibas family. ""Their whereabouts are unknown to us and we are demanding their immediate release,"" Herzog said. Blinken said that ""from day one"" the U. S. has focused on trying to secure the hostages' release. He called the swaps of captives this week ""a very positive development. """"It's also enabled an increase in humanitarian assistance to go to innocent civilians in Gaza who need it desperately,"" Blinken said. ""So this process is producing results. It's important, and we hope that it can continue. ""Blinken's arrival came amid an early morning shooting at a bus stop on the outskirts of Jerusalem, where two gunmen opened fire, killing three Israelis. Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack. Israeli security forces did not immediately comment on the Hamas claim. The shooting is the first Palestinian attack on civilians since the Israel-Hamas war began last month. Two American citizens were wounded in the attack, Blinken said. He said the killings emphasize ""the threat from terrorism that Israel and Israelis face every single day. And like you, my heart goes out to the victims of this attack. "" Surveillance video from the attack shows two gunmen exiting a car and firing on a group of civilians waiting at a bus stop. A police statement, quoting medical sources, said three civilians were killed and 16 injured, by two assailants of East Jerusalem armed with an M-16 rifle and a handgun. It said the two ""were neutralized on the scene shortly after the attack by two off-duty (Israel Defense Forces) soldiers and another civilian who fired at them. ""In a statement afterward, the Hamas military wing claimed ""full responsibility"" for the attack and said it was a response to the deaths of Palestinian women and children in Gaza and the West Bank since Oct. 7. In a statement posted on X (formerly Twitter), Netanyahu offered condolences to the families of the victims and said his government would expand its efforts to distribute weapons to Israeli civilians. Also on X, war cabinet minister Benny Gantz said the bus stop attack ""is further proof of our obligation to continue to fight with strength and determination against murderous terrorism, which threatens our citizens. In Jerusalem, Gaza, in Judea and Samaria, and everywhere,"" he wrote. Judea and Samaria are biblical names often used in Israel to refer to the West Bank. On Wednesday, Palestinian officials said Israeli troops killed an 8-year-old and a 15-year-old during a raid on the Palestinian city of Jenin. Israel's military says it killed two militants in the raid. In Gaza, where the week-long pause has temporarily halted Israel's relentless air-and-ground campaign against Hamas, at least 13,300 Palestinians have been killed since Oct. 7, according to Gaza's health ministry. While the cease-fire has allowed desperately needed aid to reach many Gazans, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said Wednesday that the delivery of aid ""remains completely inadequate to meet the huge needs of more than two million people. ""The U. N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in its latest update that aid convoys, which had been unable to reach areas north of an informal line bisecting Gaza, continued through Wednesday. It said that the Palestine Red Crescent Society and UNRWA, the U. N. relief agency that oversees the Palestinian territories, ""delivered food and non-food items, medical supplies, and fuel to shelters hosting internally displaced persons (IDPs), as well as to warehouses and hospitals. The latter included two hospitals in Gaza city, Al Ahli and As Sahaba, which received a total 10,500 liters (nearly 2,800 gallons) of fuel, enough to operate generators for about seven days. ""Aid distribution in areas of south Gaza, where the majority of internal displaced people are staying, include fuel for hospitals, water and sanitation facilities, as well as cooking gas that ""has been entering daily from Egypt since the start of the pause,"" OCHA said.

185,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/29/1215762834/hostages-israel-hamas-ceasefire-truce-gaza-war,"TEL AVIV, Israel — The temporary truce in Gaza has been extended again for another day. Israel and Hamas confirmed in statements that the pause in fighting will continue at least through Thursday, while more hostages and prisoners are exchanged. The temporary cease-fire has held for six days. On the second day of a the previous two-day cease-fire extension, 10 more hostages were freed by Hamas in exchange for 30 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, Qatar's foreign ministry announced. Separately, Hamas released two Russian citizens and four Thai nationals, Qatar said. In total, more than 100 hostages had been released by Wednesday evening, almost all of them over the past six days. Israeli officials believe Hamas still holds, in Gaza, at least 140 hostages who were captured on Oct. 7. Israel says about 1,200 people were killed when Hamas fighters swept out of the Gaza Strip and struck nearby Israeli communities. Those released Wednesday included four teenage boys, a 13-year-old girl and five women, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. One of the women, Liat Beinin Atzili, 49, is a dual U. S. -Israeli citizen, the group said. President Biden confirmed that she had been freed and is now in Egypt. Biden said he spoke with Atzili's parents, but he did not answer reporters' questions about the other American hostages in Gaza. Earlier in the day, the Israeli prime minister's office said the remaining hostages included 10 people over age 75 and four children. On the question of a longer-term cease-fire, Israel says it intends to continue its military campaign in Gaza. ""In recent days, I have heard a question: After completing this stage of the return of our hostages, will Israel go back to the fighting? My answer is an unequivocal yes,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday. The families of Israeli hostages released by Hamas continue to share stories of their relatives' captivity, with some relatives speaking to media outlets. Gideon Heiman says his 84-year-old mother did not receive necessary medical treatment while being held in Gaza. Israeli doctors also say rescued hostages have returned malnourished. One of the former captives is in stable condition at a hospital, but her family says her neurological condition is still unclear. Devora Cohen says her 12-year-old nephew, Eitan, told her that his captors used guns to threaten crying Israeli children to be quiet. There were conflicting reports on Wednesday about the fate of one family abducted on Oct. 7 at Nir Oz, a kibbutz near the Gaza border: Yarden and Shiri Bibas, a 4-year-old, Ariel, and their 10-month-old son, Kfir. Videos from Oct. 7 showed the family alive when they were taken into Gaza. Hamas' military wing, al-Qassam Brigades, said Wednesday that the mother and two children were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Hamas did not mention the father. In a statement Wednesday, Israel said it was ""assessing the accuracy"" of the claim that the Bibas family members had been killed. Israeli officials had previously said the mother and children were believed to be in the hands of another Palestinian militant group in southern Gaza. At least two other hostages were falsely reported or believed to be dead before being released alive in hostages-for-prisoners swaps. Earlier on Wednesday, Israel's military also said that two additional hostages had been released without an accompanying prisoner exchange. The release followed a statement from Hamas that the group would release two Israeli-Russian dual citizens at the request of Russian President Vladimir Putin. This week, CIA Director William Burns traveled to the Qatari capital of Doha for meetings with Qatar's prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, and David Barnea, the chief of Israel's spy agency, Mossad, according to a U. S. official who spoke to NPR anonymously due to the sensitive nature of the discussions. The pause has allowed the Egyptian and Palestinian Red Crescent societies and U. N. agencies ""to enhance the delivery of assistance into and across Gaza. "" The U. N. said a Red Crescent aid convoy carrying food, medical supplies, water and nonfood items reached areas north of an informal dividing line that bisects Gaza. Israel's military, which has focused its military campaign on the north, has warned Gazans to move south of the line. In total, 254 truckloads of food, water, baby formula and other aid have been distributed in Gaza since the truce began, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said Wednesday. The U. N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that ""airstrikes, shelling, and ground clashes have largely ceased"" since the temporary truce went into effect on Friday, but it said that ""exchange of fire reportedly took place between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups in the Beit Hanoun area, in the north, and Israeli forces reportedly used tank fire at open areas in the south. ""Even with the aid convoy reaching the embattled north, OCHA emphasized that ""the bulk of aid distribution during the day"" took place in the south. It also cautioned that the aid reaching Gaza since the pause ""is insufficient to meet the extensive needs. ""On Monday, U. N. Secretary-General António Guterres called for ""a full humanitarian ceasefire, for the benefit of the people of Gaza, Israel and the wider region.

186,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/28/1215353901/hostages-hamas-israel-gaza-palestinian-prisoners,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Joyful scenes of Israeli hostages freed and their tearful reunions with loved ones have dominated the news in Israel since last week's start of a temporary cease-fire deal with Hamas. So far under that cease-fire, Hamas has released more than 80 of around 240 hostages Israel says Hamas seized in its Oct. 7 attack on Israel. In return, Israel has freed 180 Palestinian prisoners. Of the 61 Israelis released so far, almost all are women and minors. In addition, foreign workers — mostly Thais — have been released in a separate deal. Around 160 hostages remain in captivity. Perhaps 100 are Israeli civilians. Some of the rest are soldiers, seized when Hamas raided military bases in Israel. They may end up being held the longest. There are also dual Israeli American citizens — possibly including some soldiers, according to the U. S. Israeli attacks have killed at least 13,300 people in Gaza since the start of the conflict, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. Hospitals are without electricity. Food, water and fuel are in short supply. The U. N. says three-quarters of Gaza's 2. 2 million people have been internally displaced by the conflict. Here's what to know about who is still being held hostage and some of the possible complications for releasing more. Israel's army has said that Israeli civilians and foreigners — including U. S. citizens and more than two dozen Thai farm laborers — were among those captured in the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. The attack killed some 1,200 people, Israeli authorities say. A ""substantial"" number of Israeli soldiers were also seized, Israel's Haaretz newspaper quoted an army spokesman as saying on the day of the Hamas attack. The Israeli military has not specified how many soldiers were captured. The hostages released so far are mainly Israeli women and minors, as well as a Filipino, a Russian-Israeli man and 19 Thais, mostly men. The Israelis have reported losing weight during their seven weeks in captivity and say they've survived mostly on bread and rice, sleeping on rows of chairs. Many were held underground. On Sunday, a 4-year-old girl, Abigail Mor Edan, a dual U. S. and Israeli citizen, was among those set free. U. S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the Biden administration believes eight or nine more Americans are still being held but the U. S. does not have ""solid information on each and every one of them. ""One Israeli captive, an 84-year-old woman released on Sunday, was flown by helicopter directly from Gaza to an Israeli hospital due to a serious medical condition, according to Israeli media reports. Four hostages were released last month, before the temporary cease-fire, when Hamas freed two U. S. citizens and two Israeli women. Hamas has a history of involvement in hostage situations. In 2006, Hamas abducted an Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, to the Gaza Strip, holding him for more than five years before finally handing him over in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian and Israeli Arab prisoners. Israel's current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in power then, too. Dennis Jett, a retired U. S. ambassador, told NPR last month that it ""wasn't lost on Hamas"" that such a steep price could be exacted for a high-value Israeli hostage. In 2007, BBC journalist Alan Johnston was kidnapped by the Army of Islam, a Gaza-based jihadist group, and held for nearly four months, in what he described as ""an appalling experience,"" before Hamas helped secure his release. Each day, Hamas draws up lists of hostages it is willing to release and Israel does the same with Palestinian prisoners. Israel releases three Palestinians for every Israeli hostage Hamas frees, according to the terms of the temporary cease-fire agreement. Speaking on NPR's Morning Edition, Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat professor for peace and development at the University of Maryland, said, ""It's not known why they arrived at this particular ratio, but it is clear that . . . Hamas was asking for a lot more. """"In past exchanges, the ratio was much larger — for one Israeli soldier, there were hundreds of Palestinian prisoners,"" Telhami said. ""Remember that it's very easy for Israel to arrest Palestinians. They are under occupation. Israel has a military. It can go into any town or village and arrest any number of people at any given time. ""So far, all the prisoners released have been women or minors, and many who were detained on allegations they threw rocks or Molotov cocktails at troops. Human rights groups have criticized Israel's frequent detention of minors — often hundreds each year — and its process for holding people in detention for months or more without charges. ""Most of them are lone wolves,"" Harel Chorev, a senior researcher at the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies, says of those released so far, ""people who tried to commit some sort of an attack but did not succeed. ""Going forward, Cherov says, Hamas is likely to want the release of higher-profile prisoners and Israel is going to want higher-value hostages returned in exchange. According to Mustafa Barghouti, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, there are 8,000 Palestinians in Israeli prisons, including 3,200 who have been arrested since Oct. 7. That number, he says, includes 250 Palestinian children and 2,200 inmates held without charge in administrative detention. As the pool of hostages shrinks, Hamas could demand more prisoners, or higher-value ones in exchange for hostages it holds — either under the current deal or a future truce arrangement. CIA Director William Burns arrived in Doha on Tuesday for meetings with Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani and David Barnea, chief of Mossad, Israel's spy agency, a U. S. official tells NPR. The meeting in Qatar, a key broker as the temporary cease-fire deal has unfolded, is focused on securing the release of more hostages, and partly about expanding the pause in fighting. Barghouti notes that Gilad Shalit's release by Hamas in 2011 garnered the return of 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Now, in exchange for the remaining Hamas captives, he says, ""It's just natural that 8,000 Palestinian prisoners should also be released. Especially [because] many of those are simply civilians who have not even had any charges or any due legal process. ""It's highly unlikely, however, that Israel would agree to such a deal.",npr_articles/article_186.txt,npr_results/article_186.txt.json
187,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/28/1215508077/israel-hamas-gaza-hostages-captives-truce-extension,"TEL AVIV — Israel released 30 more Palestinian prisoners Tuesday as part of the exchange for hostages held by Hamas, hours after 10 Israelis and two foreign nationals were released by the Palestinian militant group. The Israel prison service announced the release of the Palestinians. The foreign ministry of Qatar, which has mediated the pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas, tweeted that the prisoners released included 15 women and 15 minors. It appears many of them were held for days or weeks and had not been charged with crimes. Tuesday was the fifth day of a temporary cease-fire to facilitate the release of some of the around 240 hostages Hamas abducted on Oct. 7. The hostages released today included nine women, a teenage girl and two Thai citizens. The Associated Press reported that 81 hostages have been released, most of them Israelis, and 180 Palestinian prisoners have been released during the pause. Wednesday is the last scheduled day of the cease-fire, which started Friday. But it could be extended again as it has been once already. Meanwhile, CIA Director William Burns arrived in Doha for meetings with Qatar Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani and David Barnea, chief of Mossad, Israel's spy agency, a U. S. official told NPR's Franco Ordoñez. The meeting in Qatar, which has been a key broker as the temporary cease-fire deal has unfolded, is focused on securing the release of more hostages, and partly about expanding the pause in fighting. The official would not specifically say the discussions are about U. S. hostages, but noted that there are still nine Americans unaccounted for who could be held by Hamas. In the final hours of the original four-day truce that was set to expire on Monday, Qatar, Egypt and the U. S. said there had been agreement to prolong the deal at least through Wednesday if each day Hamas releases at least 10 Israeli hostages it seized in last month's attack on Israel. Around 240 captives were taken in the Oct. 7 attack that killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. On Monday, there were more scenes of jubilation — both among Palestinian families whose sons and daughters walked out of Israeli jails and Israelis who welcomed home 11 women, children and teenagers after 52 days in captivity. In all, 33 Palestinians prisoners were released after Hamas handed over 11 Israeli hostages. Among the Palestinians freed on Monday was 16-year-old Nufuth Hammad from Jenin, a city in the north of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hammad was sentenced just two weeks ago to 12 years in prison for stabbing a neighbor. She had already spent two years in jail awaiting her sentencing. Many of the Israelis freed come from a single kibbutz, Nir Oz, that was among those hardest hit in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack. They included two women, two toddlers and four other children and teens, the oldest 18. Until now, each day's hostages-for-prisoners swap has adhered to a formula of three Palestinians for every Israeli hostage, an arrangement expected to continue in the coming days. So far, 81 hostages have been released —  including 19 Thais, a Filipino and a dual Russian-Israeli citizen who were  freed outside the framework of the agreement. As significant as the extension of the pause in fighting is for more exchanges of captives, it also allows desperately needed relief aid to reach Gaza, which has been pounded by seven weeks of Israeli airstrikes and a ground offensive aimed at eliminating Hamas. At least 13,300 Palestinians have been killed since the fighting began, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Monday that ""dozens"" of aid trucks from UNRWA, the U. N. relief agency that oversees the Palestinian territories, and the Palestine Red Crescent Society had reached areas in northern Gaza, where much of the fighting has been focused. ""The assistance included medical supplies, ready-to-eat food, wheat flour, bottled water, tents and blankets, which were delivered to four UNRWA shelters and three main warehouses for subsequent distribution,"" OCHA said. The U. N. says three-quarters of Gaza's 2. 2 million people have been internally displaced by the conflict. OCHA said that the pause in fighting that went into effect early Friday ""was largely maintained"" through until Monday. ""It has enabled humanitarian actors, primarily the Egyptian and Palestinian Red Crescent Societies and UN agencies, to enhance the delivery of assistance into and across Gaza,"" OCHA said in its latest update on the situation. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the U. S. airlifted 54,000 pounds of medical items and food aid to the logistics hub in Egypt to deliver to civilians in Gaza. He said Tuesday's delivery was the first of three planned in the coming days. However, there were signs on Tuesday that the truce could be fraying. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that three explosive devices ""were detonated adjacent to IDF troops in two different locations in the northern Gaza Strip, violating the framework of the operational pause. """"In one of the locations, terrorists also opened fire at the troops, who responded with fire,"" the military said. ""A number of soldiers were lightly injured during the incidents. ""In an apparent reference to the incident, Israel's minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, posted on X (formerly Twitter) a call for Netanyahu ""to order the IDF to return and crush Hamas with force. """"We must not wait until our fighters are killed,"" Ben-Gvir wrote. ""We must once again act in accordance with the goal of the war: the total destruction of Hamas. ""Israel's military also said that three of the dozens of soldiers kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7 are dead and that Hamas has their bodies, but didn't give further details.",npr_articles/article_187.txt,npr_results/article_187.txt.json

189,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/27/1214400643/israel-hostages-avera-mengistu-hamas-gaza,"Nine years. That's how long ago since the Mengistu family last saw their son and brother, Avera Mengistu. He was 27 years old when he ran across the Gaza border in a state of emotional distress and was taken by Hamas. He is 36 now. ""It's a hole. It's like a sense: like eyes, or ears, or a wound. You live with it forever, until this whole thing is over and he comes home,"" Yallo Mengistu said of his brother's absence in his family's lives. ""We live with it all day, every day. ""Mengistu's kidnapping remains top of mind for his family and Israel's Ethiopian Jewish community after around 240 hostages were taken by Hamas on Oct. 7. A deal to that has resulted in the release of some of the hostages did not include a mention of a possible exchange for Mengistu or Hisham al-Sayed, a Palestinian citizen of Israel of Bedouin descent who was taken by Hamas in 2015. The posters bearing the names and faces of the Oct. 7 hostages hang almost everywhere across Israel: on street signs, bus stops, restaurant windows and cars. But Mengistu's name and face is nowhere to be seen, although Israel says it is committed to bringing back all hostages. Mengistu's case highlights the inequality facing Ethiopian Jews and other non-white Israelis, says one artist and activist who has called for Avera's return for years. ""Avera's story is my story and it's the story of the entire Ethiopian community,"" Michal Worke, an Israeli artist of Ethiopian descent, said. ""Nine years he's been a hostage in Gaza, and no one cares. ""Yallo Mengistu said he is not trying to make comparisons between those taken on Oct. 7 and his brother's case. But just like those families of the Oct. 7 hostages, the absence of his brother is a wound that cannot heal without his return, he said. ""Every time that someone brings up Avera in front of my mother, she cries,"" he said. ""And a lot of years have gone by, but you don't get used to it. It's a living thing. ""After a fight with his mother on Sept. 7, 2014, Avera Mengistu left his family home in Ashkelon, Israel, and never returned. Video evidence viewed by the family shows that Mengistu entered Gaza by crossing a fence that night, according to Human Rights Watch. He crossed into Gaza in full view of Israeli soldiers who didn't stop him. Once in Gaza, he was taken captive by Hamas. The night he left, Mengistu was in an emotional state, his brother said. He had been suffering from a decline in his mental health since the death of his brother, Masrashau, in 2011 and had been hospitalized and on medications. The fact that Mengistu crossed the Gaza border by himself and suffered from mental health issues is a point that has since been twisted by some in the Israeli media and the government to dismiss the gravity of his situation, Worke, the artist calling for his release, said. ""It wasn't of his own accord. Avera was diagnosed as mentally ill, he was admitted to a psychiatric hospital twice, he was on medications,"" Yallo Mengistu said. His brother couldn't take responsibility for his actions. ""So the claim that he crossed the border of his own free will, it's not even relevant. ""A week after Mengistu was taken, there was a meeting with his family and some government representatives. ""They told us, 'We know where he is, there's no need to worry, just keep it quiet. Don't talk about it. ' Then, a month later, we were visited by the Commander of the Gaza Division, he came and said that they had lost contact with him [Avera] and they didn't know where he was. Since then, we haven't had any information. Nothing. ""In a statement to NPR, the Israeli prime minister's office said: ""All the hostages held in Gaza will be brought back to Israel. Gal Hirsch the special coordinator for the hostages and the missing appointed by the prime minister met with the Mengistu family. Israel is committed to bringing back all its hostages and missing people, including Avera Mengistu. ""The Israeli government only announced Mengistu was held by Hamas in July 2015 — almost a year after his disappearance. That was because the Israeli newspaper Haaretz submitted a request to repeal the gag order put on Mengistu's case by the government. If that hadn't happened, Yallo Mengistu said the family likely would have continued to stay quiet. In 2015, Haaretz released a YouTube video of a call between the Mengistu family and members of the government in which the officials can be heard threatening and bullying the family. ""It's the hardest possible situation. On one hand, they tell you that if you talk it's going to be bad for him, and will result in him staying in Gaza for much longer, but if you keep quiet, we'll bring him back right away,"" he said. ""You shut up and suffer in silence. It's a terrible feeling. ""In January 2023, more than eight years after his kidnapping, Hamas released a video purporting to be of Mengistu still alive. According to The New York Times, Mengistu asked in Hebrew in the video, ""How long will my friends and I remain in captivity here after long years of suffering and pain? Where are the state and the people of Israel?"" At the time of the video's release, i24NEWS English spoke to the Mengistu family. They said they were uncertain about whether it was definitely Avera. The family said they saw video only through the press — just like the rest of Israel. In the nine years since his brother's kidnapping, the Mengistu family has found a silver living: ""Regular people who never met Avera, they did more and helped more than the government,"" Yallo Mengistu said. There is a sizable portion of Israeli society, he said, including of the Mengistu's own Ethiopian Jewish community, that has supported their family. Ethiopian Jews started arriving in Israel in the late 1970s. Now, there are more than 140,000 Jewish Israeli citizens of Ethiopian origin. But the Ethiopian Jewish community often suffer serious discrimination and inequality in Israel. Ethiopian Jews are often on the the lowest socioeconomic rung in Israel. Worke is an artist and a member of this population. Since Mengistu's kidnapping, she has painted him and his family. She posts her work regularly on social media and appears at protests always advocating for his release. She said she sees the inequality facing the community everywhere. ""I've confronted it in my education, in the art world, where they don't give enough voice to Ethiopian artists,"" she said. ""So, Avera's story appears in lots of smaller stories and it makes his story more symbolic, something shared by the whole community. ""Worke said she's seen the artwork created in honor of the hundreds of Israelis taken on Oct. 7, some of whom have been freed as part of a deal with Hamas involving the release of Palestinians held in Israeli jails. ""There are artists who immediately started working, who just jumped right in and started showing their faces [the kidnapped] and giving them a platform. But not for Avera. He isn't there, his face isn't anywhere,"" she said. She continues to post about his case, sharing her paintings of him, even after Oct. 7 when much of the focus has been on the hostages taken in the Hamas attack. She said she's faced criticism for doing so. ""I post a critical story about Avera and people say it's not the time to criticize. If you don't say something, nothing will change,"" she said. ""And I want it to be clear, I love my country. But I think if you want to change something, you have to identify the problem. ""NPR's Jaclyn Diaz reported from Tel Aviv.

190,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/27/1215330196/israel-and-hamas-hint-at-extending-truce-as-more-captives-are-slated-to-be-freed,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Another 11 Israeli hostages were freed by Hamas in exchange for 33 Palestinians prisoners on Monday — part of a temporary cease-fire deal that the two sides have agreed to extend. An elite unit of the Israel's military and its domestic security service ""are now escorting the 11 abductees,"" the Israeli military said in a statement. ""After undergoing an initial assessment of their medical condition, our forces will accompany the returnees until they reach their families in the hospitals. ""All 11 captives were seized from the same kibbutz community, known as Nir Oz,  near the Gaza border during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Around 240 hostages were taken and about 1,200 people killed in the attack, Israel says. Some of those released on Monday have dual French, German and Argentinian citizenship. Kibbutz officials said those being released are mothers and children as young as 3 years old who all have fathers still held in Gaza. ""The news this evening brings a sigh of relief to our community, however we remain deeply concerned about our loved ones that are still held hostage,"" said Osnat Peri, the head of the kibbutz. ""We demand the return of all hostages, immediately, whatever it takes. "" Peri said out of the hostages still held, 49 are from Nir Oz, including women, men, children, mothers, fathers, grandfathers and grandmothers. Later Monday, Israel released Palestinian prisoners as part of its end of the deal. The Associated Press reported a bus with prisoners arrived in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Qatar – which is mediating these deals –  posted on X earlier that Israel would release 33 prisoners, including 30 minors and three women. According to the AP, Monday's swap brought the total number of hostages released to 50 Israelis and 19 people of other nationalities. Israel has been releasing three prisoners for every Israeli freed, expected to bring the total to 150 by the end of Monday night's exchange. The extension of the deal would allow for dozens more captives to be freed and increase the flow of humanitarian aid into the embattled Gaza Strip. Hours before Hamas freed the fourth batch of captives, the foreign ministry of Qatar said the truce had been prolonged. Qatar has been a key broker in the negotiations over the temporary cease-fire, along with Egypt and the U. S. In a statement, Hamas confirmed the agreement for another two days ""under the same conditions as the previous truce. ""Israel did not immediately comment on the expansion of the cease-fire, but previously indicated its willingness to continue the arrangement for up to 10 days if Hamas continued freeing captives at a rate of 10 per day. Around 240 captives were seized by Hamas in last month's attack on Israel and about 1,200 people killed. U. S. President Biden thanked Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar, and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt for their work to reach an extension of the humanitarian pause in Gaza. ""We will not stop until all of the hostages held by Hamas terrorists are released,"" Biden said in a statement. The extension comes on what would have been the last day of the previously negotiated hostages-for-prisoners swaps. After Sunday night's exchange of another 17 hostages by Hamas for an additional 39 Palestinians jailed by Israel — the third of four such daily swaps agreed to as part of the original cease-fire deal — there were already signs that lengthening the timeframe was in the works. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told NPR's Morning Edition earlier Monday that the ""onus is going to be on Hamas"" to come up with an additional 10 hostages per day. He said it's up to Israel and Hamas to agree on who they would be. ""This isn't hyperbole,"" Kirby added. ""We have been working this literally by the hour, and that will be no different today. ""Israel has vowed to resume its stated goal of crushing Hamas once the truce is broken or expires. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, speaking to soldiers who left Gaza for a short break, vowed: ""We will return to fighting and use the same strength and more. This is the mission now. ""Among those released so far are 17 Thai laborers seized in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, as well as one Filipino. A dual Israeli-Russian citizen was freed on Sunday after what Hamas described in a statement as the ""efforts of Russian President Vladimir Putin and in appreciation of the Russian position in support of the Palestinian cause. ""In seven weeks of Israeli airstrikes and ground assaults in Gaza, more than 13,300 Palestinians have been killed, mostly women and youth, according to Palestinian health officials. The health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip reports a higher death toll, but it does not distinguish between civilians and militants. For every hostage released by Hamas, Israel has been releasing three Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons. There are growing signs that anger over the war in Gaza and elation at the release of scores of jailed Palestinians is fueling Hamas' popularity in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Speaking to NPR last week, Dana Hafi, a 21-year-old resident of the Qalandiya refugee camp in Ramallah, said she didn't want to talk about politics, but then added, ""but Hamas is the only thing left fighting for Palestinians. "" If Israel crushes Hamas, ""they will crush all Palestinians,"" she said. Umm Mohammed, another resident of Qalandiya, said she doesn't want war. ""No one wants war,"" the 55-year-old said. ""People want their children to live, to grow up and learn and become doctors and engineers,"" she said. But speaking of Israeli soldiers, Mohammed said, ""when they come, evict you from your home, from your land, where are we meant to go?""Michael Barsinai, from Kibbutz Be'eri, one of the hardest hit Israeli communities in the Oct. 7 attack, told NPR Sunday that he supports an extension of the the cease-fired deal, ""as long as we get hostages back, that's fine,"" he said. ""We remember all those that are still there. ""One hostage, Elma Avraham, 84, who was released by Hamas on Sunday, was  flown by helicopter directly from Gaza due to a serious medical condition, Israeli media reports. She remains in an intensive care unit ""and her life is still in danger,"" according to The Times of Israel. Other hostages report losing weight during their 50 days in captivity, surviving mostly on bread and rice. Some slept on rows of chairs and many were held underground. Shmuel Brodutch, whose daughter-in-law and three grandchildren were released by Hamas on Sunday, told Morning Edition that he couldn't divulge details about their captivity or release. ""I just want to tell you that I'm happy about them being here, I'm ready to hold them and to kiss them and to spoil them and that's it,"" he said. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), in its latest update, says the temporary cease-fire ""has been largely maintained. """"This pause has enabled the U. N. to enhance the delivery of assistance into and across Gaza,"" it said. Speaking on Morning Edition, Juliette Touma, the communications director for UNRWA, the U. N. relief agency that oversees the Palestinian territories, said it's ""safe to say"" there's been an increase in the number of aid trucks and humanitarian supplies flowing into Gaza since before the pause. That now includes fuel and cooking gas, which she called ""major breakthroughs. "" Still, Touma, who was in Gaza before the pause began, said more is needed. ""We also hope and call for the transformation of that pause into a much longer-term humanitarian cease-fire across the board,"" Touma said. ""It's been a brutal, brutal war with so many losses on all sides. It has got to stop. ""Israel's relentless military campaign in Gaza in the lead-up to the pause has been described by OCHA in desperate terms. The agency says nearly 80% of the territory's 2. 2 million have been internally displaced as a result of the seven weeks of fighting. Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) said 200 humanitarian aid trucks were dispatched Monday to the Gaza Strip, through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The humanitarian aid trucks only carry food, water, shelter equipment and medical supplies. Since the assault on Gaza began after the Hamas attack, Israel's military has focused operations in the north of the territory, warning Gazans to flee south to avoid being injured or killed. It said that overcrowding and poor sanitation at shelters administered by UNRWA have caused ""significant increases in some communicable diseases and conditions such as diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, skin infections and hygiene-related conditions like lice. ""The Gaza Strip has been under an electricity blackout since Israeli authorities cut power, and fuel reserves to the territory's sole power plant are depleted. The supply of potable water in Gaza's south, part of which comes by way of  two pipelines from Israel, has continued, OCHA says, while UNRWA was getting fuel supplies to help run two seawater desalination plants that also supply the south. Meanwhile, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, OCHA says the market price of vegetables has surged 32%, with wheat and flour up 65%. The price of mineral water, it said, had doubled since the conflict began. NPR's Scott Neuman, Daniel Estrin and Brian Mann reported from Tel Aviv.

191,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/27/1214451419/civilian-deaths-are-being-dismissed-as-crisis-actors-in-gaza-and-israel,"On one side of the split-screen video, a young man lies injured in a hospital bed. A red banner across the top of the frame reads ""Yesterday. "" On the other side, under a green banner reading ""Today,"" a similar-looking man walks through rubble in Gaza. ""I'm now walking in a neighborhood where there were houses. There are no houses anymore,"" he says. The post on X, formerly known as Twitter, claims the side-by-side videos show the same person. It accuses him of faking his injuries, only to be ""miraculously healed"" and walking around just a day later. But the videos actually show two different people, according to fact checks from multiple media outlets. One is a Palestinian teenager who lost his leg this summer during an Israeli raid in the West Bank. That video was originally posted to TikTok in August. The other is a Palestinian social media influencer in Gaza who has been documenting the conflict since October. The conflation of the two individuals is a prime example of a ""crisis actor"" trope: the false claim that, for propaganda purposes, people are pretending to be victims of tragedies — in this case of Israel's war in Gaza, which Palestinian health officials say has killed more than 14,000 people. ""It is a means by which you blunt those narratives or the reality on the ground,"" said Moustafa Ayad, executive director for Africa, the Middle East and Asia at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a nonprofit that studies extremism. ""You discredit them off the bat. ""The false accusations have spread on multiple platforms, including X and Facebook, boosted by pro-Israel influencers with large followings. Some of the videos on X carry labels warning they are ""presented out of context. "" But the false claims have still been widely seen, with one video racking up 5 million views. Crisis actor narratives have become a standard element of the messy information landscape of catastrophe, from the war in Syria to the Russian invasion of Ukraine to mass shootings in the U. S. Sometimes, the claim is that a real victim never existed. Other times, behind-the-scenes movie footage or images of unrelated events are presented as proof an incident was staged. But the intent is the same, Ayad said. ""It comes out of a defensive posturing: trying to essentially downplay civilian casualties in conflicts of this nature. ""And that's why the false claims keep coming. They're a way of deflecting the horrors of war. Claims that Palestinians are manufacturing injuries and deaths are particularly widespread online, where videos and pictures are often derided as creations of ""Pallywood. ""That pejorative — a mashup of Palestine and Hollywood — was coined by an American professor in 2005 in the aftermath of disputes over who killed an 11-year-old Palestinian boy five years earlier. In 2013 the Israeli government released a report suggesting the event had been staged and questioning whether the child was shot or killed in the incident. His father, as well as the cameraman who captured the event, reject the report's findings. Mentions of ""Pallywood"" have steadily increased across social media platforms since Hamas's Oct. 7 attack, according to fact-checkers at Logically Facts, which tracks online disinformation. Much of the volume is being driven by accounts outside of Israel, Logically Facts found, with the U. S. and India the most common origin for posts that contained geographical data. Many accusations involve mischaracterized or out-of-context images, like a photo of a Thai child's Halloween costume in 2022 and video from a decade-old protest in Egypt that have been presented as evidence that Palestinians are faking dead bodies. An Israeli government spokesperson posted a clip from a film set, writing ""Pallywood gets busted again. "" (He later deleted the post after being fact-checked. )One surge in online ""Pallywood"" references came on Oct. 13, the day Israel's official X account accused Hamas of trying to pass off a doll as a child killed in Gaza. The claim was picked up and echoed by other accounts, including several Israeli embassies. But the accusation was false. The BBC found and spoke to the family of the child — a four-year-old killed in an Israeli airstrike. Multiple photojournalists captured images of his body, wrapped in a white sheet. The @Israel X account has deleted its post about the child. The episode showed that ""even when the image is real, even when the context is real, people still approach it having so many existing biases that they can dismiss this evidence before their eyes,"" said Emerson Brooking of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab during a panel about disinformation in the war. Crisis actor accusations have also been levied at Israelis. Social media posters and even some public figures have questioned whether Hamas really killed 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7, despite graphic images and survivors' stories. Some denialists baselessly claim the slaughter was a ""false flag"" planned by the Israeli government — another common conspiratorial trope, closely related to crisis actor accusations. When CNN interviewed children whose parents were killed by Hamas, a TikTok user accused the network of ""hir[ing] actors and photoshop[ping] grief. "" That video has been taken down. A clip from the making of a short film, originally posted online last year, has been used by some to falsely claim Israelis are faking deaths, and by others that it shows Hamas staging a killing. The flood of crisis actor claims in the current conflict may be a result of the sheer volume of imagery that is available online. ""I don't think we're meant to deal with this level of of traumatizing video,"" said Mike Caulfield, who studies the spread of viral rumors at the University of Washington's Center for an Informed Public. Faced with that amount of footage, there's no question it can be hard to sort fact from fiction. Clips from video games and images from other conflicts are being misrepresented as showing Gaza or Israel. Some images have been revealed to be generated by artificial intelligence. ""One of the big themes of this war is just sort of a mass distrust of any images, real or not,"" said Jack Brewster of NewsGuard, which rates the reliability of online news sources. But claiming civilian deaths are fake takes skepticism and turns it into justification, ISD's Ayad said. ""One of the toughest parts of a war is believing that your side has been involved in killing civilians,"" he said. ""You will go to great lengths to try to downplay those casualties, because it does have an ability to reframe a lot of the reasons people go to war.

192,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/26/1215229669/first-thought-to-be-dead-a-9-year-old-israeli-girl-is-released-by-hamas,"The night before the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre, 8-year-old Emily Hand had a sleepover with a friend in southern Israel. The next morning, Hamas rampaged through Kibbutz Be'eri, one of the places hit hardest in the attack, including the home where Emily was staying. As Israeli authorities tried to identify the dead in the days that followed, they told Emily's father, Tom Hand, that his daughter was among those killed. When the Israeli officials gave him the news, ""I went, 'Yes!' Hand said in a tearful interview with CNN. ""That was the best possibility that I was hoping for. She was either dead or in Gaza. And if you know anything about what they do to people in Gaza, that is worse than death. ""For Hand, it was a double blow. His wife, Emily's stepmother, was killed in the Hamas attack. Emily's biological mother, Hand's previous partner, died of cancer when she was 2 years old. But at the end of October, Israeli authorities came back to Hand with stunning news — they had evidence Emily was alive and was among the roughly 240 hostages Hamas was holding in Gaza. ""I had to shift my whole brain and digest this new information. And when they told me, I just went, 'No, no, no no,'"" Hand told The Associated Press. He went from despair to guarded hope, waiting day after agonizing day. On Nov. 17, while still a hostage, presumably in the Hamas tunnels under Gaza, Emily turned 9 years old. Then, late Saturday night, Hamas released 13 Israelis, eight of them children, including Emily. Video showed her running into the arms of her father as they were reunited after seven weeks. But there are cruel twists in these hostage releases — while the hostages are  key figures in Israel-Hamas war, they've been kept in the dark, literally and figuratively. Deep under Gaza, they have little knowledge about the enormity of the Hamas attack, which killed around 1,200 people in Israel, or the wider war. Since Emily was at her friend's home when she was seized, she probably had no way of knowing that her stepmother was killed — or that her father was still alive. But as the ordeal ends for those who have been released, they are now receiving the new shock that family members and friends were killed. In another development, Emily's case sparked a controversy Sunday. She and her father are duel Israeli-Irish citizens, which prompted Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar to tweet about her release, saying, ""an innocent child who was lost has now been found and returned. "" Many in Israel were outraged, stressing Emily was not ""lost,"" but was abducted by Hamas and held hostage. Israel's Foreign Minister Eli Cohen responded to the Irish prime minister with a tweet of his own:""Mr. Prime Minister, Emily Hand is not lost. Maybe you have lost your moral compass and your connection to reality. Emily Hand was kidnapped by a terrorist organization worse than ISIS after her stepmother was murdered. Emily and over 30 other Israeli children were kidnapped by Hamas, and you are trying to legitimize it. Shame on you!"" ",npr_articles/article_192.txt,npr_results/article_192.txt.json
193,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/26/1215226229/another-hostages-for-prisoners-swap-expected-if-a-fragile-cease-fire-holds-in-is,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Hamas says it wants to extend a temporary cease-fire with Israel in Gaza in hopes of securing the release of more Palestinian prisoners in exchange for hostages it seized in its Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a video posted after the Hamas statement came out, said he was open to an extension of the cease-fire if Hamas freed 10 hostages per day. Previously, Israel has said it could extend the deal for up to 10 days. In a statement posted to the social media platform Telegram, the Islamist militant group said it was ""seeking to extend the truce after the end of the four-day period"" which started on Friday and is to end on Monday. The Hamas announcement came hours after it freed a 4-year-old girl whose parents were killed in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, along with 12 other Israelis, three Thais and a dual Israeli Russian citizen. In return, Israel released 39 Palestinians, including one Gaza resident who was handed over on the Egyptian border, while the others were delivered near Ofer Prison and the Jerusalem detention center in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. A spokesman for Qatar's foreign ministry said on X (formerly known as Twitter) that among the hostages freed were a South African woman and two individuals from Hungary. The young girl, Abigail Mor Edan, turned 4 in captivity on Friday. She is a dual U. S. -Israeli citizen. The unidentified Israeli Russian was freed first in response to ""efforts of Russian President Vladimir Putin and in appreciation of the Russian position in support of the Palestinian cause,"" Hamas said in a statement earlier. The others were freed afterward. President Biden confirmed Abigail had been freed but did not provide information about her well-being. Speaking to reporters from Nantucket, Mass. , where he was spending the Thanksgiving holiday, Biden said: ""What she endured is unthinkable. ""Biden noted that Abigail's mother was killed in front of her in last month's attack and that when she ran to her father, he was gunned down while shielding her. ""Thank God she's home,"" Biden said. ""I just can't imagine the enjoyment, and I just – I wish I were there to hold her. "" Abigail's great aunt Liz Hirsh Naftali and cousin Noa Naftali thanked Biden and the Qatari government for helping secure the girl's freedom. ""We hoped and prayed today would come. There are no words to express our relief and gratitude that Abigail is safe and coming home,"" they said in a statement. In two previous exchanges, Hamas released 26 Israelis and 14 Thai laborers as well as one Filipino. In return, Israel has freed 78 Palestinian prisoners, all women and minors. Tens of thousands of Thai and Filipino laborers work in Israel. Dozens were among the 1,200 people that Israel says were killed in the Oct. 7 attack and others were swept up as Hamas took some 240 hostages. The Gaza Health Ministry says 13,300 Palestinians have died in seven weeks of Israeli bombardment of the territory. With the release of Abigail, two women with U. S. -Israeli citizenship are still being held. Biden on Sunday said he remains hopeful about the Americans who are still unaccounted for, but did not have a concrete update on their release. He said the administration is working with Qatar and the other negotiators to extend this pause to facilitate the freedom of additional hostages. The latest exchange of captives comes on the same day that Netanyahu visited Israeli soldiers in Gaza, his first known trip to the Palestinian enclave in more than a decade. Netanyahu's office released a video of his visit showing the prime minister wearing a helmet and body armor and appearing to stand among empty Palestinian homes, where troops were stationed. His office said he visited one of the underground Hamas tunnels revealed during Israeli military operations. In a video, Netanyahu said ""we are going all the way"" on Israel's goal of eradicating Hamas. Meanwhile, there are signs of rising violence in the West Bank, where Israeli forces killed five people in an operation overnight at a refugee camp there. Three others were killed elsewhere in the territory, according to the Palestinian health ministry. On Saturday, the second exchange of captives came close to unraveling over what Hamas said were Israeli violations of terms of the truce that has briefly halted the fighting in Gaza. Israel denied such violations. Among the captives freed on Saturday was 9-year-old Emily Hand. Her father,  Thomas Hand, had been informed she was killed in the attack only to be told later that her body was not found among the victims. ""We can't find the words to describe our emotions after 50 challenging and complicated days,"" Thomas Hand said in a statement to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. In Gaza, which has been pounded for nearly seven weeks by a relentless Israeli bombardment before the temporary truce went into effect, humanitarian groups were rushing aid to civilians while the situation on the ground was still relatively quiet. Israeli military officials issued a warning on Sunday to civilian Palestinians inside Gaza, ordering them to remain in the south and not to travel within a half-mile of the border with Israel. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported at least eight Palestinian civilians killed by Israeli soldiers over the last 24 hours in the West Bank, according to The Associated Press. ""It's good that we have a truce in Gaza, but there is no truce in the West Bank,"" said Basil Abu Nasr, a shopkeeper in the Qalandiya refugee camp near Ramallah. ""They still raid our villages, they still raid our refugee camps . . . make arrests and attack people. ""Aman Naf'a, whose husband has been jailed by the Israelis, told NPR that violence by the Israeli military and settlers angers many of her Palestinian neighbors. ""We want the whole world to see what they are doing to us,"" Naf'a told NPR. The Israeli military said its soldiers killed five Palestinians in a gun battle in the Jenin refugee camp and arrested a Palestinian suspected of killing an Israeli father and son earlier this year. In an appearance on the social media site X on Saturday, Israel Defense Forces Maj. Doron Spielman said the IDF was trying to limit threats to Israeli civilians after Hamas' deadly attack. ""We are focused on Gaza but this has been a multi-front war over the last five weeks,"" Spielman said. He also pointed to threats from Hezbollah, an anti-Israel militia backed by Iran operating in southern Lebanon.  Israeli officials have said they plan to resume their full-scale offensive against Hamas in Gaza once the temporary truce ends.  In a statement early Sunday, United Nations officials said they hoped the cease-fire would be extended. ""The longer the pause lasts, the more aid humanitarian agencies will be able to send in and across Gaza,"" the U. N. statement said. The U. N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said 200 trucks loaded with aid were dispatched on Saturday and that 187 had entered Gaza by 7 p. m. local time (noon EDT). The bulk of the aid went to areas in the south, it said. OCHA says that 1. 7 million people in Gaza, or nearly 80% of its 2. 2 million people, are internally displaced and that nearly 900,000 of them were sheltering in some 100 facilities in the south.

195,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/25/1215176593/gaza-israel-hostages-palestinian-prisoners-release,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel received a list of a third group of hostages that are set to be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners on Sunday, a day after Hamas freed 17 captives. The office of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it had received a list of the hostages due for release. The list is being checked by security officials, according to Agence France-Presse, and families have been informed. Seven weeks after being seized by Hamas militants during a massive attack on Israel, 13 Israelis and four Thais walked to freedom late Saturday — but not before a last-minute delay nearly scuttled the deal. The hostages join 13 others already released on the first day of a temporary cease-fire deal between Israel and Islamist militant group. In return, Israel released 39 Palestinian prisoners, more than a day after it freed another 39. After Qatar and Egypt helped resolve a last-minute snag, Hamas said that the hostages-for-prisoners swap it put on hold for several hours was back on track. The sudden reversal capped hours of uncertainty after the Palestinian militant group pulled back on the exchange deal, alleging that Israel had violated the terms of a temporary cease-fire agreement. Then, Hamas issued a statement on social media saying it was putting the exchange back in motion after mediation from Egypt and Qatar ""conveyed the occupation's (Israel's) commitment to all the conditions stipulated in the agreement. ""Israel's military later said it had been informed that the 17 hostages captured by Hamas were released, and that Red Cross representatives had transferred the hostages to Egypt. In its Oct. 7 attack, Hamas killed around 1,200 people and captured about 240 hostages, according to Israel. The four-day cease-fire agreement announced earlier this week covered the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. In its attack, however, Hamas captured a number of Thai farm laborers and other foreign workers. According to the Israeli government, the 13 Israeli hostages released include seven children and six adults whose ages range from 3 to 67 years old. Among them are 11 women or girls and two boys. Qatar says the group of 39 Palestinians released on Sunday are women and children. Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman, in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), had said earlier that 39 Palestinians would be released in exchange for 13 Israelis, ""in addition to 7 foreigners outside the framework of the agreement. ""  The Qatari spokesperson said in a later update that only four foreigners would be released. On Friday, the first day of the cease-fire, the Palestinian militant group freed 13 Israelis, and — in a surprise move — 10 Thais and one Filipino as well. Israel released 39 Palestinians. In the on-again, off-again lead up to a resolution on Saturday, senior Hamas leader Osama Hamdan told a Beirut-based satellite news channel that a disagreement over how much aid Israel was allowing into northern Gaza was one sticking point and the reason for the delay. Another, he said, was Israel's firing on Palestinians — an apparent reference to an incident on Friday in which Hamas says two people were killed and 30 wounded by Israeli soldiers. Israel's military has declined multiple requests for comment on the shooting. The Israeli prime minister's office declined immediate comment, but an Israeli official told NPR that ""Israel did not violate the agreement. ""Earlier Saturday, in a plaza in central Tel Aviv that has become known as ""hostages square,"" serving as a gathering place for families and supporters of those held by Hamas, the atmosphere was subdued, but cautiously optimistic before the second group of captives were released. Yossi Vikovzky, 68, is a founding member of the Nahal Oz kibbutz, where many people were killed by Hamas militants in last month's attack. ""In truth, I feel like everyone here feels,"" Vikovzky said. ""I'm torn. I'm so happy for every person who gets out [of Gaza], but whoever doesn't get out now, who knows if they'll ever get out?""Among the Israelis who won freedom on Friday is Hanna Katzir, who the Palestinian Islamic Jihad — a militia group that also took part in last month's attack on Israel — had earlier said was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Other Israelis released are eight members of three separate families, including four young children. Five captives, including Katzir, are in their 70s and the oldest is 85. Hospital officials said the freed hostages were in good physical condition. As Israeli hostages were being freed and reunited with their families on Friday, there were scenes of celebration in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where the Palestinians prisoners were being handed over. An enormous crowd in the heart of Ramallah gathered, chanting pro-Hamas slogans and waved the militant group's green flag. Israel has said it could extend the temporary truce by up to ten days if Hamas keeps releasing hostages on at an agreed ratio of one Israel for every three Palestinians. Egypt's state information service on Saturday said that Egyptian officials were working with parties involved in the negotiations ""to extend the truce period between the Israeli and Palestinian sides, for a day or so. ""Israel's military has vowed to resume fighting once the deal expires or breaks down. ""At the end of the operational pause, we will return promptly to our operations and offensive in Gaza,"" military chief of staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said Saturday. More than 13,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the conflict and tens of thousands of others wounded, according to the latest figures from Gaza's health ministry. In Gaza, the pause in fighting has opened the door for the besieged Hamas-controlled territory to receive badly needed food, fuel and other supplies after weeks of bombardment from Israeli warplanes and ground forces. Israel has vowed to crush Hamas. The fighting has displaced nearly half of Gaza's population of 2. 3 million people, according to UNRWA, the U. N. relief agency overseeing Palestinians. Last month, Israel's military warned Gazans living in the northern half of the territory, which includes Gaza City's half-million people, to move to the south or risk being killed during Israeli operations. The U. N. World Food Program says it has been making daily deliveries of food assistance to territory, reaching more than 700,000 people. ""But it is not enough. With the collapse of food systems, humanitarian assistance is becoming the only lifeline. It must be scaled-up and sustained,"" WFP said in a post on X. A spokesperson for Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) said Saturday that 200 trucks carrying humanitarian aid entered Gaza from Egypt. It said the trucks were carrying food, water, shelter equipment and medical supplies. The same number of trucks were dispatched to Gaza on Friday, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). OCHA said an additional 61 trucks with food, water and medical supplies reached northern Gaza, which it said was the largest aid delivery to the region since the conflict began. The Palestinian Red Crescent says it was able to deliver the humanitarian aid by convoy to Gaza City and the North Gaza Governorate. On his second visit to Gaza, UNRWA Commissioner-General General Philippe Lazzarini said the agency is ready to receive more than 150 trucks a day of aid. ""It is time to remove bureaucratic hurdles and restrictions on UNRWA so that we can expand and accelerate the delivery of much-needed humanitarian assistance to more than two million people,"" Lazzarini said.",npr_articles/article_195.txt,npr_results/article_195.txt.json
196,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/24/1215049675/temporary-truce-begins-in-gaza-reports-say-with-first-hostages-set-for-release,"TEL AVIV, Israel — After nearly seven weeks in captivity, 24 hostages seized by Hamas in its deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel are now free after crossing into Egypt. In exchange, Israel released 39 Palestinians hours later at the city of Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu published a list of 13 Israelis, 10 Thais and one Filipino released by Hamas Friday evening. By 8 p. m. local time (1 p. m. ET), the Palestinians held in Israeli jails were also free. ""The Israeli government embraces our citizens that returned home,"" Netanyahu's office said. ""The Israeli government is committed to the return of all abductees and missing persons,"" adding that the Israelis had undergone an initial medical exam and that their families were informed. Among the freed captives, Israel lists eight members in three separate families, including four young children, as well as several other individuals. Five of the captives are in their 70s and the oldest is 85. Many of the freed hostages came from a single kibbutz, Nir Oz. In Ramallah, where people gathered to celebrate the release of the Palestinians, the festive scene turned into one of protest against Israel's occupation and the war in Gaza. Many of the protesters praised Hamas, describing the Oct. 7 terror attack as an act of resistance. Earlier in the day, Israeli soldiers fired tear gas at about 150 Palestinian protesters in the West Bank. In a statement from Hamas, referring to the freed prisoners, the militant group praised ""the sons of our struggling Palestinian people. "" It said its ""great action on the battlefield"" had forced Israel into the exchange deal. Hamas released a list of the prisoners it expected to be freed, all of whom come from the West Bank or East Jerusalem. Qatar helped broker the four-day cease-fire deal that included the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinians prisoners. Egypt and the United States were also part of the negotiations. Under the agreement, Hamas is anticipated to release a total of 50 Israelis over the four-day period in exchange for 150 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, a spokesman for the Gulf state's foreign ministry said that in addition to the Israelis, ""10 Thai citizens and a Filipino citizen,"" were among those released Friday and were not a part of the truce agreement. Thousands of Thais work as farm laborers in Israel. Officials believe 13 others are still being held by Hamas. NPR's producer Anas Baba was at the Rafah crossing in Gaza where he saw four Red Cross vehicles, at least one of which was carrying a handful of women who waved at people watching them from the sides of the road. The temporary truce went into effect at 7 a. m. local time (midnight ET) on Friday. It comes weeks after the Hamas attack that killed more than 1,200 Israelis and in which roughly 240 hostages were taken, according to Israel. Israel's military has responded with airstrikes and a ground campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 12,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry. Subsequent hostages-for-prisoners swaps are set to occur in batches in the coming days of the truce, which Israel says could be extended up to 10 days. Earlier, the Israeli military released images of a helicopter with two rows of noise-canceling headphones – ready to take the freed Israeli hostages to a military reception center. Officials said they would then be taken to hospitals to be reunited with their families. Social workers will be on hand to break the news that some of their friends and relatives were killed in the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks. President Biden, speaking in Nantucket, Mass. , told reporters that the hostage release is ""only a start, but so far it's gone well. ""No Americans were included in the initial 13 hostages released Friday morning, including two women and a 4-year-old girl who could be part of the deal. Biden said the work continues to free them and the other hostages that remain.  ""We'll not stop until we get these hostages brought home and an answer to their whereabouts,"" Biden said. In response to a question about timing for the Americans' release, he said, ""It's my hope and expectation that it will be soon. ""Biden said there is a rush to bring food, medicine, water and fuel to Gaza. Biden reiterated his commitment to pursuing a two-state solution for long-term stability in the region and thanked the leaders of Qatar and Egypt for their partnership in securing the deal. Large areas of Gaza have been devastated by Israeli airstrikes and tanks since the conflict began, leaving much of the territory's 2. 3 million people without electricity, food and clean water. According to UNRWA, the U. N. relief agency overseeing Palestinians, more than a million Gazans have been internally displaced as a result of the conflict. The U. N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)  said 200 trucks were dispatched to Gaza and that 137 had been unloaded on Friday, ""making it the biggest humanitarian convoy received since October 7. ""The U. N. office said that 129,000 liters (about 34,000 gallons) of fuel and four trucks of gas also crossed into Gaza and that 21 ""critical patients"" were evacuated in a large-scale medical operation from the north of Gaza. ""Hundreds of thousands of people were assisted with food, water, medical supplies and other essential humanitarian items,"" it said. In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, UNRWA said: ""No matter how much they provide — it is difficult to meet demands of the whole"" Gaza Strip, adding that ""over-crowding and unsanitary conditions"" were leading to the spread of disease. Earlier Friday, in the first hours of the cease-fire, crowds of Palestinians were seen pouring into the streets in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. Some Palestinians in southern Gaza tried to return to their homes for the first time since the start of the conflict. As the pause began, Hamas and Israel blamed each other for violations. Israel's military says Hamas launched rockets into Israel 15 minutes after the start of the pause, and that Israeli forces didn't retaliate. The Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry said that two people were killed and 30 wounded when Israeli soldiers opened fire on them in the early hours of the truce. An Israeli military official told NPR they were checking on the reports, and that any shooting would be a violation of the cease-fire agreement. Israeli security forces say they've arrested more than 1,950 ""wanted persons"" since the start of the conflict. It says about 1,100 of the detainees are ""associated with the terrorist organization Hamas. ""In southern Gaza, Mohammed El Azzazi, a pharmacist from Rafah, expressed skepticism of the cease-fire. ""There are no results from this pause, a pause where people can't return to their homes and injuries among people trying to go home,"" he told NPR. Meanwhile, at the Qalandiya refugee camp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Raed Hhadeh, who teaches physics at a school in Ramallah, said he had mixed feelings about the cease-fire. ""I feel good for the people to have rest from the bombardment, but this is not the solution,"" he told NPR. ""It's a massacre. They are slaughtering children and this has to be stopped. ""He said that Gazans returning to their homes in the east ""won't find anything left.

197,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/23/1214179757/gaza-israel-hamas-palestinians-jordan-refugee-camp,"AMMAN, Jordan — The concept of ""home"" can be a tricky one. Ask a person, ""Where's home for you?"" and they may respond with where they were born, or where they grew up, or where they live today. This question is particularly fraught for the people we came to meet in Hitten camp, one of 10 refugee camps in Jordan that the United Nations provides services for. About two million registered Palestinians live in Jordan, the most of any country. Many people at Hitten, northeast of Amman, have spent much or all of their lives here. But ask them where home is, and the overwhelming answer is the Palestinian territories: Gaza or the West Bank. We came here earlier in November to ask what's on their minds, as war and violence unfold in places that may be miles away, but that feel central to their identities. The first thing you notice when, as foreign journalists, you secure permission from local authorities to visit Hitten, is how permanent it looks. The word ""camp"" suggests a temporary arrangement and rows of tents. But Hitten has been here for generations, complete with concrete buildings and well-established neighborhoods dotted with mosques, narrow alleys, shops and a lively vegetable market. The market is where we find Samir Musri. He is shopping with his eight-year-old daughter. He was born in Amman, but has lived in this camp for years. He identifies as Palestinian, from the West Bank. As we strike up a conversation, we're quickly interrupted by another passerby – an older woman. She shouts that whole families are being eliminated in Gaza, that so many people have been killed. She tells us no one is helping them, not even fellow Arabs. The sense of anger in Hitten is palpable. We turn back to Musri. ""Of course we're angry, because children are being massacred,"" he says through an interpreter. ""Hospitals were bombed. So yes, it is a massacre, and people are very angry in the camp. ""Musri directs us deeper into the camp, to a neighborhood where many Palestinians from Gaza have settled. There we walk with Saleh Nakhleen, who is head of logistics on the committee that runs the camp. He is one of the 90,000-odd people who live in Hitten, about 20,000 of whom live in this particular neighborhood. He explains to us that none of them are refugees from this recent war. Many of the residents were born in this camp, and some arrived in Jordan at other moments of conflict, like the Nakba, Arabic for ""catastrophe"" – the mass displacement of 1948. As we walk with Musri, we're approached by an older man wearing a traditional red and white keffiyeh. As we introduce ourselves, he stops and asks, ""American?"" We confirm. Abu Emad Al Din tells us that America is the enemy, but he agrees to talk to us. Many people in the region feel some version of this way, since the United States government – with the strong support of President Biden – offered $14 billion in military aid for Israel's response to the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. Al Din goes on to say he despises Biden, but he understands there is a difference between people and their government – a sentiment shared by many of the people we spoke to in Jordan. Al Din was born in Gaza in 1945. He was three when his family was forced out during the Nakba, and has been here ever since. ""I wish I could go back [to Gaza] right now,"" he tells us through an interpreter. ""I would go back in a heartbeat. ""We continue to attract crowds everywhere we walk. Another man invites us into his home. His name is Majid Ghawanmeh. He's a pharmacist. Several others follow Ghawanmeh and our team into his house. We remove our shoes and sit on brown, flowered cushions lining the wall. In the center of the room, a TV is turned to Al Jazeera Arabic, which is showing footage of the carnage in Gaza split screen with U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaking about the war. ""To be honest with you, we don't entertain or host the enemy,"" Ghawanmeh tells us through an interpreter. ""And today, the enemy is America. ""Nonetheless, a young boy circles the room offering each of us small thimbles of Arabic coffee and plump dates on a plate. We begin to discuss the war, and he tells us he wants to see a cease-fire, not a humanitarian pause. His wife is Gazan and her entire family lives there. ""I never imagined in my life that a democratic country would be against a cease-fire — to stop killing civilians, despite any political motive or objective,"" Ghawanmeh says. ""You know what a humanitarian pause [is]? It's a way that the Israeli military can regroup and restrategize. ""The man next to Ghawanmeh tells us he was visiting the camp from Gaza for a few months, because his father is from here. His name is Maher Rashaideh – and now, because of the war, he's not able to get home. His family, his children, are all inside Gaza. His biggest priority is just trying to reach them. Internet and cell phone service have been cut repeatedly in Gaza in the past month. Israel, which maintains a blockade on Gaza, hasn't said if it's trying to cut off communications. Rashaideh says when he does manage to get a call through, his questions and message are simple: ""I told them, 'How are you? Are you living? Take care of yourselves and your sisters. '""During our conversation, an older woman sits down with us on the cushions. Eventually we realize that she doesn't know anyone in the room – she just saw us walking the camp, wanted to speak to us, and followed us right into a stranger's home. She asked us to identify her as Um Mohammed, because she's worried about the potential security risks for her daughters who are still living in Gaza. She came to this camp when she got married, but is from Gaza. ""I don't cook anymore. I don't eat anymore because of what is happening in Gaza,"" she says through an interpreter. Two of her daughters are sheltering at a U. N. school in Gaza near Rafah Crossing. ""I don't sleep,"" she continues. ""You know what my children did? They intentionally broke my TV so I don't watch what is happening there. So I'm on the phone all the time. ""Between tears, she tells us she's been in Jordan for 46 years. When we ask her where home is, she points – right around the corner. But her heart, she says, is in Gaza. When asked if she thinks she'll see Gaza again, she throws up her hands: ""Inshallah. "" God willing. The men around the room nod. Local producer Rana Sweis contributed to this report.",npr_articles/article_197.txt,npr_results/article_197.txt.json
198,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/23/1214977160/the-delayed-temporary-cease-fire-in-gaza-could-move-forward-on-friday,"TEL AVIV, Israel — A deal to pause the fighting in Gaza and exchange Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners — originally expected to start on Thursday — will instead begin early Friday morning, according to the foreign ministry in Qatar, where the deal was negotiated. The new start time for the anticipated four-day pause in the fighting would be 7 a. m. local time, according to a spokesperson for the foreign ministry in Qatar. The first group of 13 Israeli hostages — all women and minors — are expected to be handed over by Hamas after 4 p. m. local time, with Israel releasing Palestinians at that time, the foreign ministry said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office did not immediately confirm the new start time, but issued a statement saying it had received an ""initial"" list of hostage names. ""The relevant officials are checking the details of the list and are currently in contact with all families,"" it said. Later, a spokesperson for Israel's military cautioned that the deal could still fall through ""and even during the process there may be changes all the time. """"Hamas will try to take advantage of the deal and the days of a lull in fighting, by creating fear and spreading disinformation and using manipulation,"" the spokesperson said, adding that the deal ""is not the end of the process of returning the abducted, but the beginning. ""Hamas' military wing said in a statement that Israel was expected to free three Palestinian prisoners in exchange for each Israeli that's freed from Gaza. The agreement calls for a total of at least 50 Israelis and 150 Palestinians to be freed over the four-day period, although Israel says that timeframe could be extended, with more releases on both sides, up to 10 days. The deal also allows for 200 humanitarian aid trucks to enter Gaza each day, according to Hamas. Egypt, which was also a party to the negotiations, announced the same revised date and time for the implementation as Qatar and Hamas did. The temporary cease-fire and hostages-for-prisoners swap had been expected to go into effect on Thursday, but a few hours after midnight, it was suddenly put on hold. Hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke in a televised, late-evening media briefing where he discussed the agreement, Israel's National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said the temporary cease-fire was still on track ""according to the original agreement,"" but that it wouldn't occur before Friday. The reason for the delay was not immediately clear, but Israel's Channel 12 quoted an unnamed Israeli political official as saying ""the delay isn't substantive, but technical. ""The pause in fighting comes more than six weeks after roughly 240 Israeli hostages were seized by Hamas fighters in Gaza during a deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel. The temporary truce is also meant to allow badly needed fuel and food trucks into Gaza, which has been bombarded by Israeli forces since the start of the conflict. The terms of the agreement allow for it to be extended up to 10 days if Hamas continues releasing hostages. But the delicate nature of the deal and how it will be implemented was highlighted by Netanyahu during his Wednesday briefing. Reading from what he said was part of the temporary cease-fire agreement, the prime minister said that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) ""will be allowed to visit the rest of the hostages and provide them with necessary medicines. "" ""I expect them to do their job,"" he added. But the ICRC's spokesperson in Jerusalem, Sarah Davies, told NPR that the group was ""not made aware of any agreement reached by both parties"" related to such visits. ""Should visits be agreed upon, the ICRC stands ready"" to conduct them, Davies said, adding that the aid group ""does not take part in the negotiations between the parties to the conflict. ""In a statement issued later, the ICRC said it ""welcomes any respite from the fighting and bombardment in Gaza,"" adding that ""everything possible must be done to scale humanitarian aid during this pause. """"Israel should immediately allow for the permanent resumption of sufficient fuel, water and electricity supplies, without which humanitarian needs will continue to deepen,"" the Red Cross said. Meanwhile, the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry says that Israeli troops arrested the director of the Al-Shifa Medical Hospital Complex, Dr. Muhammad Abu Salamiya, on Thursday. Salamiya was traveling with a U. N. World Health Organization convoy that was stopped at an Israeli checkpoint, the health ministry says, and as a result, it has decided ""to stop coordination with the World Health Organization on the issue of evacuating the remaining wounded and medical teams until a report is submitted explaining what happened and the detainees are released. ""The Israel Defense Forces and the Israeli Security Agency (ISA) issued a statement about the arrest, acknowledging that Salamiya had been taken into custody and ""transferred for ISA questioning. "" It said that Al-Shifa, ""under his direct management, served as a Hamas command and control center,"" adding that the Hamas tunnels utilized hospital electricity and resources and that Hamas stored weapons there. ""Furthermore, after the Hamas massacre on October 7th, Hamas terrorists sought refuge within the hospital, some of them taking hostages from Israel with them,"" it said. Salamiya's arrest comes a day after Israel's military released a video of what it said was an extensive tunnel network below the hospital, complete with toilets, sleeping quarters and air conditioning. The army, which laid siege to the hospital, says the facility, Gaza's largest hospital, was used as a covert Hamas command center.

Yarden Gonen's sister Romi was kidnapped that day at the Supernova rave festival. ""They were young, full of life and wanted to celebrate,"" Gonen says. ""Instead they faced the worst day of their lives. ""Gonen says her family is now waiting anxiously to learn if Romi, 23, will be among those freed in the coming days. ""I just keep on praying and sending really good energies,"" Gonen told NPR Wednesday, after details of the deal were made public. ""I'll be excited for anyone that will be [released] because they are my family too. ""Qatar announced a four-day ""humanitarian pause"" in fighting between Israel and Hamas as part of a deal it mediated, along with the U. S. and Egypt, for Hamas to release 50 women and children being held hostage in Gaza. Qatar says Israel will release some Palestinian women and children from Israeli prison. According to accounts of the agreement, hostages will be freed in installments over four days. Israeli officials say they will pause military operation in Gaza and release 150 Palestinian prisoners. The temporary cease-fire comes after Hamas-led militants killed roughly 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attacks and seized about 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials. Since then, Israel's air and ground assaults in Gaza have killed at least 12,700 Palestinians, according the Palestinian health ministry. Gonen says news of the hostage deal was her first moment of real hope after weeks of violence and fear. ""It's 47 days [since the Hamas attack] and it's literally like we're stuck in the same day,"" Gonen says. ""So we're very welcoming [for this deal and] everyone who comes out of this terror and this horror. But in the same breath, it's really hard because at the same time, maybe my sister won't be among the 50 people. So I'm trying hard not to get my hopes up. ""Hamas has signaled that many of those will released will be elderly or children under the age of 19. When Hamas fighters attacked the Supernova concert, Romi Gonen was able to call her mother. In a recording of part of their conversation, shared by the family with NPR, gunfire can be heard and so can shouts, which the family believes are the voices of Hamas fighters. ""The last few minutes they are speaking of Romi, they are saying she is alive, they shouldn't kill her, they should take her with them,"" Gonen said. ""Then one of them says, 'Okay I will take her. ' And then the call ended. ""The family believes Romi was shot in the hand during the attack and seriously wounded. They're not certain she is still alive. ""We really have a really strong intuition,"" Gonen says. ""We really feel her. ""Yarden Gonen, her mother and other siblings have been coming to a square in Tel Aviv where the families of hostages gather each day to share support and information. Other Israelis are also keeping vigil. According to Gonen, the sense of community has been vital to her family's spirits and mental health. But even with that help, she said these weeks of waiting without solid information about her sister have been exhausting and terrifying. ""We have our ups and downs. We have so much support,"" she says. ""I have a new family right now. All the [hostage] families are in the same boat I'm in, suffering from the same pain and uncertainty. ""A coalition of families whose relatives were taken hostage issued a statement on Wednesday, urging the Israeli government to move quickly to secure the release of additional hostages. ""We welcome every hostage who returns home, yet our demand remains unchanged, the immediate release of all 236 hostages,"" the group said. ""Securing the safe release of every hostage is a national priority. There is no victory until every last hostage returns home. ""Israel has indicated by releasing a total of 300 Palestinian prisoner names that more exchanges of Israeli hostages for prisoners may may occur in future phases of the negotiated deal, if the initial agreement is carried out. While Yarden Gonen worries about her sister, she is also frightened for her partner, who's been called up to serve in Israel's army as part of a mobilization of 300,000 reservists to support the war. Though she is happy about the newly announced deal to release some hostages, she fears the pause in fighting will give Hamas a chance to regroup, leaving Israel and its army more vulnerable. ""This is the fear all the time because you don't know what they're planning or what they know or what they are doing or what they plan to do,"" Gonen says. With so much uncertainty, Gonen says she and her family now have to wait a little longer for a phone call from Israeli government officials, confirming whether Romi is coming home as part of this deal.",npr_articles/article_200.txt,npr_results/article_200.txt.json

It's also possibly where 50 Israeli women and children, held hostage by Hamas since Oct. 7, may walk free from Gaza, following a complex deal between Israel and Hamas, mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the United States. Four hostages previously released from Gaza last month exited through the Rafah crossing, with assistance from the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Rafah crossing is also the only access point now for aid to enter Gaza, a territory run by Hamas that's been under an Israeli blockade for more than 16 years and where Egypt has also restricted movement in and out. This makes Rafah a key lifeline for 2. 3 million Palestinians trapped inside the Gaza Strip. Around 1,400 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies have entered Gaza through Rafah over the past month, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Aid groups say it's a fraction of what Gaza needs and a trickle compared to the roughly 10,000 trucks that entered Gaza every month, mostly from Israel, before the war. Gaza has been under Israeli siege since the Oct. 7 attacks, in which Israel says Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people and seized around 240 hostages. Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip have since killed at least 12,700 people, according to Palestinian health officials. The Israeli siege of Gaza has cut people off from access to clean drinking water and enough food, as well as the fuel needed to power hospitals, desalination plants, sewage pumps, homes and communication lines. As part of the deal struck between Israel and Hamas, much more aid may be allowed to enter Gaza through Rafah in the coming days during a pause in the fighting. In rare visit to the Rafah border last week organized by Egypt for a small number of journalists, NPR saw large, 18-wheeler trucks carrying food, water and medicine as they slowly passed through the crossing, exiting Egypt. It's a roughly six-hour drive from Cairo to Rafah, with several military and security checkpoints along the way. Some of this aid going into Gaza comes directly from Egypt and some is flown in from around the world, landing at a small logistical airport in the Egyptian city of Al-Arish. That cargo is loaded onto trucks that wait, sometimes for days, before entering Rafah. Delays have happened for a number of reasons, including Israeli shelling and bombardment of Gaza near the border, as well as a lack of fuel or communications lines at times needed to distribute aid inside Gaza. The head of operations for Egypt's Red Crescent, Lotfy Gheith, says the Rafah crossing cannot keep up with the overwhelming scale of Gaza's humanitarian crisis. His team of volunteers and staff, wearing bright-red vests at the Rafah border and Al-Arish airport, are overseeing aid efforts in Egypt. He says Gaza's 1. 5 million displaced people require more than 9 million liters of drinking water per day. A large UNICEF truck carrying boxes of water bottles crossed into Gaza on the day NPR visited the crossing, but the truck was carrying barely enough drinking water for a few thousand people. The Red Crescent has started sending jerrycans with water filters for people in Gaza because ""providing this huge number of water and a limited number of trucks"" is very difficult, Gheith says. It is ""impossible,"" Gheith says, to try and provide 2. 3 million people in Gaza with enough drinking water through trucks from Rafah every day. As humanitarian aid trucks slowly make their way into Gaza, another gate at Rafah is reserved for people departing the besieged territory. Among the few thousand Palestinians with foreign passports who've been allowed to leave for safety abroad are a mother and her teenage boys. They have just crossed into Egypt, and are dragging suitcases packed with whatever clothes they could grab after their house was bombed and the rubble collapsed on them. Dazed and exhausted, the woman prefers to give only her first name, Hanan. She says her families' livelihood and memories remain in Gaza. She breaks into tears when asked who she's leaving behind. ""My parents,"" she says, sobbing. Her youngest son hugs her, tries to make her laugh, but she's despondent. ""There's no hope in life,"" she says as she wipes her tears and makes her way toward a waiting car. Some 400 Palestinians out of an estimated 30,000 wounded in the war have been able to leave Gaza for medical treatment in Egypt over the past few weeks. Brightly colored yellow and blue ambulances carry patients through the crossing. This week, Egyptian ambulances carried 28 premature babies through Rafah to hospitals in Egypt, but not before eight others had already died in Gaza. The babies were all removed from their incubators in Al-Shifa hospital after it ran out of fuel for its generators and was forced to evacuate patients and staff during an Israeli raid. Egypt, however, has not opened its border for all Palestinians to leave Gaza, fearing it could lead to a permanent displacement of refugees in North Sinai and draw Israel and Egypt into direct conflict. Israel approves the names of Palestinians leaving the Gaza Strip, including the roughly 400 critically wounded permitted to leave for treatment in Egypt in past weeks. Israel also inspects every truck that enters Gaza through Rafah at another checkpoint further south, adding to the backlog of getting aid in. Israel says the checks are needed to ensure no weapons enter Gaza. Despite pleas for weeks by Egypt for fuel and more aid to enter Gaza, it took two weeks from the start of the war for Israel to agree on the first 20 trucks of aid to enter through the Rafah crossing on Oct. 21. It came after a visit by President Biden to Israel, in which he urged that aid be allowed into Gaza. It was also only last week, on Nov. 18, that Israel permitted fuel to enter Gaza for the first time since the start of the war, despite Egypt's readiness to deliver fuel much sooner through Rafah. Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi has said that Israel's siege of Gaza is aimed in part at pushing Palestinians into the Sinai Peninsula. The U. S. and other Arab states have also publicly rejected the transfer of Palestinians to Sinai as a possible solution to the crisis. This fear, however, has underpinned Egypt's position that more aid needs to urgently enter Gaza. The United Nations says far less than half of the 200,000 liters of fuel a day it needs to distribute food and other aid is entering Gaza under the latest Israeli rules. U. N. humanitarian relief chief Martin Griffiths has called on Israel to open one of its border crossings with Gaza so more aid can reach people. ""People need to know that there will be aid coming tomorrow or the next day,"" he said, adding that around 60% of trucks entering Gaza before the war used to pass through Israel's Kerem Shalom border during the years of blockade. ""So please, Kerem Shalom. Please Israel, give us that for our crossing point,"" Griffiths said in comments to reporters last week in Geneva. The U. N. relief agency that aids Palestinians, UNRWA, says it is distributing aid that is coming into Gaza, including flour, canned food, mattresses, tents and other basic supplies. ""But it is NOT sufficient to meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of people- we need more, NOW,"" the agency said Tuesday in a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter.",npr_articles/article_201.txt,npr_results/article_201.txt.json
202,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/22/1214613334/israel-hamas-gaza-hostages-ceasefire,"TEL AVIV, Israel — The release of hostages being held by militants in Gaza — in return for a release of Palestinians held by Israel — will not start before Friday, Israel's national security adviser said in a statement. The hostage release is tied to plans for a four-day pause in fighting that has not yet started. The announcement from National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi dampened hopes that either will start Thursday, or that the deal will indeed stay on track, though Hanegbi said negotiations continue.   ""Negotiations for the release of our captives are progressing,"" he said. ""The start of the release will proceed according to the original agreement between the parties, and not before Friday. "" Israel and Hamas on Wednesday announced details of the four-day cease-fire, saying it calls for freeing at least 50 Israeli women and minors seized during last month's Hamas attack on Israel in exchange for at least 150 Palestinian women and minors held in Israeli jails. In Washington, Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed the agreement for the release of hostages, ""including American citizens. "" There are 10 dual U. S. -Israeli citizens unaccounted for, a senior Biden administration official said, three of whom could be released as part of the deal, including a 3-year-old whose parents were killed on Oct. 7. ""Her birthday is actually Friday,"" Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, told NPR's Morning Edition. ""She'll turn 4 on Friday. ""In a news briefing late Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is ""constantly working to bring everyone back. """"What paved the way for this deal was massive military pressure on Hamas and great political pressure,"" he said. ""I believe that this combination will allow the release of more hostages in the next stages. ""The deal, brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the U. S. , is set to go into effect when the first Israeli hostages are released by Hamas, both sides said. It comes more than six weeks into an intense war in Gaza triggered by Hamas' massive Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which Israel says militants killed some 1,200 Israelis and seized around 240 hostages. At least 12,700 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's bombardments on Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials. But this figure hasn't been updated for several days following the collapse of communications and hospital closures in the north of Gaza. The deal outlines an initial four-day pause in the fighting, with at least 10 Israelis released each day of the cease-fire, both sides have said. The Palestinian prisoners would be freed over the same period. The International Committee of the Red Cross will act as an intermediary in the  hostage/detainee swaps, according to an unnamed Israeli official briefing Israeli media. Each day, lists of Israeli hostages and Palestinians jailed by Israel will be exchanged. The ratio will be three Palestinians for one Israeli, the official said. ""Our role is to facilitate the implementation, once the parties agree,"" the ICRC said in a statement Wednesday. In Wednesday night's briefing, Netanyahu, reading from what he said was part of the agreement, said that the ICRC ""will be allowed to visit the rest of the hostages and provide them with necessary medicines. ""Despite the temporary truce, Netanyahu said: ""I want to be clear. The war continues. We will continue it until we achieve all our goals. To return all our abductees, to eliminate Hamas. ""In answer to a question later, Netanyahu said the prisoners who are being released ""are not murderers, but they are dangerous terrorists. We will do our best to make sure they do not harm Israelis, but the risk exists. "" Israel has said it is willing to extend the temporary cease-fire up to five more days, and free an additional 150 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, if Hamas frees 50 additional Israeli hostages — which could bring the total number of those ultimately freed under the deal to 100 Israelis and 300 Palestinians. McGurk said the deal is structured to incentivize additional releases. ""Four days is four days,"" he said. ""You can do more with more time, and the onus for more time right now is on Hamas. "" Early Wednesday, Israel published the names of Palestinian prisoners slated for release in accordance with Israeli law, which allows the Israeli public to submit objections to Israel's Supreme Court. An Israeli group representing victims of Palestinian attacks petitioned the court to block the deal, Israel's Channel 13 reported. The court, however, is not expected to intervene. On the list are 33 women and the remainder are boys ages 14 to 18 who were arrested by Israeli forces in recent years. Some are Palestinians being held without charge, while others are awaiting trial on charges ranging from incitement and stone-throwing to attempted murder. ""Holding people as hostages is itself illegal, a war crime, and Hamas should release all the hostages unconditionally. But it is appropriate that Israel release prisoners and detainees to advance this goal,"" said Jessica Montell, executive director of the Israeli human rights group HaMoked, which provides legal aid to Palestinians. McGurk stressed that the deal came out of weeks of ""painstaking"" work. And while he called it good news, he stressed that ""until we see the hostages come home, nobody here is sitting quietly. "" Although the names of the Israelis that Hamas intends to free have not been made public, news of the deal sparked hope among families on both sides of the conflict who have waited anxiously for the release of their loved ones. Hen Avigdori, an Israeli comedy writer whose wife Sharon and 12-year-old daughter Noam are being held in Gaza, said the Israeli army promised to notify him ahead of time if they are slated to be released. ""I am calm, because I know that there is hope. But I'm also calm because I know the hope can be shattered at any moment,"" Avigdori told NPR. A Palestinian resident of Jerusalem, Yousef Afghani, was surprised to see his 40-year-old daughter Aisha Afghani on Israel's list of prisoners it is prepared to release. She has served seven years of her 15-year sentence, convicted for an attempted 2016 stabbing in which no one was wounded. Her father told NPR she was carrying a knife but denied she attempted a stabbing. ""My feelings are the feelings of any father. Celebration and happiness and joy,"" Afghani told NPR. But he also condemned the kidnapping of Israelis to Gaza, which resulted in the deal to free his daughter. ""We are against any kind of attack against civilians. ""Boaz Atzili, an international studies professor at American University in Washington, D. C. , has been waiting six weeks for any news of his cousin, Aviv, and his cousin's wife Liat, who are believed to be held hostage in Gaza. Atzili told NPR's Morning Edition that every hostage who is freed — especially children — is a good thing, but he hopes the deal will be expanded even further to release all of them. He added that ""no price is too high to pay for the life of so many people,"" and lamented the toll of the fighting on Palestinian civilians, too. ""Aviv and Liat are peace-loving people, they are peace advocates,"" Atzili added. ""I want to tell the Palestinians that these are not your enemies. We all need to look ahead. And there are two nations, two people in this small land and neither of them is going anywhere — so we need to start to think about a peaceful solution. "" Meanwhile, in Rome, Pope Francis met separately with Israeli relatives of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, and families of Palestinians held in Israel. In unscripted remarks afterward, Francis said he felt ""both sides are suffering,"" but that the conflict had ""gone beyond war. This is not war; it's terrorism. ""In addition to Israelis and U. S. citizens, foreigners from several other countries are among the people believed to be held by Hamas. Among them are more than 20 Thai farm laborers seized near the Gaza border in the Oct. 7 attack. The agreement, which appears to have been in the works for weeks, was approved by Israel in a marathon series of cabinet meetings that stretched into the early hours Wednesday. Israel's Channel 12 news says the deal allows ""significant"" humanitarian aid into Gaza, including desperately needed fuel to run generators — the only source of electricity throughout much of the besieged territory. Since Israel launched airstrikes and a subsequent ground invasion of Gaza after last month's Hamas attack, the territory's 2. 2 million people have experienced dire shortages of food, water and medical supplies. Hamas said ""hundreds"" of trucks carrying aid and fuel would be allowed to enter Gaza. In a statement late Tuesday, President Biden said he and first lady Jill Biden were ""keeping all those held hostage and their loved ones close to our hearts these many weeks, and I am extraordinarily gratified that some of these brave souls, who have endured weeks of captivity and an unspeakable ordeal, will be reunited with their families once this deal is fully implemented. ""Biden thanked Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani and Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi for help in brokering the deal. Speaking in Qatar, Al Thani said he hopes the humanitarian truce could provide a framework to ""stop the war machine and bloodshed. "" Sissi said Egypt would continue ""efforts made to reach final and sustainable solutions that achieve justice, impose peace, and guarantee the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. ""Israel has made clear that the deal doesn't mean the fighting is over. In a statement, the Israeli government said it ""will continue the war in order to return home all of the hostages, complete the elimination of Hamas and ensure that there will be no new threat to the State of Israel from Gaza. ""Hamas, in its own statement, welcomed the agreement that it said was reached after ""difficult and complex negotiations for many days. "" But the militant group that has controlled Gaza since 2007 also cautioned ""our hands will remain on the trigger, and our winning battalions will remain in control to defend our people and defeat occupation and aggression.

203,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/21/1213892449/palestinians-israel-war-discrimination-censorship,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Two years ago, Samah Abou Shhadeh graduated from college and landed a coveted job as an economist at an Israeli financial services company in a skyscraper in downtown Tel Aviv. Abou Shhadeh's hiring broke barriers. ""I was the first Arab to come to this company, with all Jewish colleagues. I felt like I had to work extra hard,"" she tells NPR. She commuted daily from her home in Jaffa, an ancient Arab quarter of what is now Tel Aviv, where her family has lived for centuries. At work, she kept her head down, and avoided talk about politics. Instead, she'd regale her colleagues with talk about her upcoming wedding.  ""All of them were my friends, before the war,"" she says. But everything changed on Oct. 7, when Hamas militants attacked multiple locations in Israel, killing around 1,200 people and kidnapping about 240, according to the Israeli government. Israel has responded with fierce bombardment of Gaza that has killed more than 12,000, Palestinian health officials say. Colleagues began sharing grief and rage on social media, Abou Shhadeh recalls. But when she did the same, there were big consequences. On Oct. 9, she shared a clip on Instagram from a 2022 Israeli documentary called Tantura. It's about a massacre in one Palestinian village during the 1948 war over Israel's founding. She posted the footage, without any commentary of her own. This was on her personal account. Her manager phoned her the next day. Colleagues were offended. He asked her to remove the clip. Abou Shhadeh refused — and a letter from human resources followed. She was fired.  At least 20% of Israelis identify as Arab or Palestinian, like Abou Shhadeh. Most of them are descendants of the people who weren't killed, expelled or compelled to flee when Israel was created. Many say they've long felt like second-class citizens. But human rights advocates say this Gaza war has unleashed a wave of mistreatment, abuse and further discrimination. This month, three Palestinian doctors in Israel penned an open letter decrying ""racism, militarism and hypocrisy"" in the Israeli medical system, where they say their Jewish colleagues have been ""cheering for the killing of innocent Palestinian civilians. ""Abou Shhadeh is mulling a labor discrimination lawsuit, but she's scared. She asked NPR not to name or contact her company. She's worried it could hurt her prospects of finding a new job. In the HR letter outlining her dismissal, which Abou Shhahdeh showed to NPR, the company says it supports freedom of expression, but that during wartime, more sensitivity is expected from employees. Abou Shhadeh crossed a line, it reads. ""This is all absurd. We are not talking about feelings that are hurt,"" says Sawsan Zaher, a human rights lawyer based in Haifa, Israel. ""We are talking about a massive wave of political persecution against Arab citizens inside of Israel. ""Zaher, who does not know or represent Abou Shhadeh, says she's getting 20 times more queries from Arabs reporting labor abuse inside Israel compared to before the war. ""Every phone call is people who are being fired from their jobs or suspended from colleges and universities,"" she said. ""But they're also being arrested, and indictments are being submitted. "" Some Israeli media have carried stories about this. But data are difficult to compile. Many victims say they're scared to speak up. One of those arrested and released this month was Haneen Zoabi, a former member of Israel's parliament. She's part of Balad, an Arab political party that advocates for the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel. On Nov. 9, Zoabi and five colleagues gathered in a public square in her hometown of Nazareth, in northern Israel, for what they had planned as a peaceful protest, she recalled in an interview with NPR at her home. They'd applied for a permit to protest, but police turned it down. They gathered anyway, with banners that read, ""Stop Genocide"" and ""Stop the war in Gaza. "" But before they could even unfurl their banners, police came and arrested Zoabi and her colleagues. ""We didn't have the time to hold the banners! We were on our way. We were six people, and the police didn't allow us — without banners, without anything — even to stand — to stand in the middle of Nazareth,"" she said. Zoabi was arrested for alleged ""incitement"" and for attempting to protest without a permit, a Nazareth police spokesperson confirmed to NPR. As of early November, Israeli police had issued dozens of indictments for incitement to violence and terror, and had opened dozens of other such cases, since the beginning of the war, according to The Times of Israel. Police haven't made more up-to-date data public. Authorities haven't broken down those arrests by ethnicity, but Palestinian citizens of Israel say they've been disproportionately targeted. Palestinians also have been arrested under an amendment added earlier this month to Israel's counterterrorism law, making ""consumption of terrorist materials"" — reading pro-Hamas content online, for example — a new criminal offense. The law has been criticized by rights groups groups including Article 19 and Adalah as being ambiguous and far-reaching. Adalah has called the new amendment ""one of the most intrusive and draconian legislative measures ever passed by the Israeli Knesset. ""It makes thoughts subject to criminal punishment . . . and criminalizes even passive social media use,"" the group says. Zoabi is a prominent Israeli dissident who's been detained for protesting before. But she says this time was different. She says Israeli police officers sang Jewish victory songs and waved an Israeli flag while booking her. ""They were dancing,"" she says. A police spokesperson told NPR he did not know anything about that behavior.  Arrests like Zoabi's aim to further frighten and intimidate the Palestinian community, she says. Many are appalled by their government's bombardment of Gaza, but are scared to speak up, she says. ""If you don't open your mouth, they will start to say, 'Your silence is suspicious!' Zoabi says. ""It is not enough if you shut your mouth. You should express that you agree with them, that you identify with them. ""  Even those determined not to stay silent have to tread carefully. In a barn off a rural road in northern Israel, Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel gathered together one recent evening to paint peace banners. The idea is to hang them from highway overpasses together. The painters are members of grassroots group called Standing Together, which says it aims to bring Jewish and Palestinian citizens together ""in pursuit of peace, equality, and social and climate justice. "" At the gathering NPR attended, participants decried what they called increasing censorship of Palestinians in Israel, and of those who support them. ""There's a lot of discrimination. People are starting to tell on other people if they're criticizing the war or if they're even sympathizing with the pain of the Palestinians in Gaza,"" says Orly Mor, a Jewish dual American-Israeli citizen and member of the group. On the banners, Mor and her friends were painting slogans — in Arabic and Hebrew — calling for Palestinians and Jewish Israelis to join hands and support each other in this war. For Abou Shhadeh, the economist in Tel Aviv, a simple social media post cost her a job. She worries that taking legal action against her former employer might hurt her prospects for a new job — which she desperately needs. She and her fiancée have a mortgage to pay. They were supposed to get married this month, but the wedding is delayed because of the war. Before Oct. 7, Abou Shhadeh marveled at how she could live in Tel Aviv's old Arab quarter Jaffa and commute across town to the city's mostly Jewish financial district. She was part of both of those worlds, and she was proud, she recalls. ""Now, this war has made me feel like I never belonged there,"" she says, gesturing across to the Tel Aviv skyline. Local freelance producer Abed Abou Shhadeh contributed to this report. He and Samah Abou Shhadeh are members of the same extended family.

Qatar, which has mediated talks that have gone on for weeks, said Israel has agreed to release ""a number"" of Palestinian women and children being held in Israeli prisons. Earlier reports stated Hamas was seeking the release of about 150 prisoners. The announcement, in a tweet from Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said the starting time of the pause will be announced in the next 24 hours. The announcement came after the Israeli government announced it had approved a deal for the pause in fighting to facilitate the release of ""at least 50"" of the approximately 240 hostages seized by Hamas in its deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7. The Qatari government statement also said that the agreement would allow the entry into Gaza of ""humanitarian convoys"" including relief aid and fuel. In a statement late Tuesday night, President Biden said he and first lady Jill Biden welcomed the announcement. He thanked Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar and President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi of Egypt for their roles in helping broker the announcement. ""Jill and I have been keeping all those held hostage and their loved ones close to our hearts these many weeks, and I am extraordinarily gratified that some of these brave souls, who have endured weeks of captivity and an unspeakable ordeal, will be reunited with their families once this deal is fully implemented. ""Media reports earlier Tuesday said the deal was expected to include Israel's release of a number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel did not mention a prisoner release in its government statement. Israel's statement said it approved an ""outline"" for the release of at least 50 women and children who were abducted in the Hamas attack Oct. 7. The Israeli statement said that after the initial four-day period, Israel would be willing to extend the ""pause"" in hostilities one more day for every 10 additional hostages Hamas released. The statement made clear that the fighting is not over, adding that Israel ""will continue the war in order to return home all of the hostages, complete the elimination of Hamas and ensure that there will be no new threat to the State of Israel from Gaza. "" Speaking with families of the hostages on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that returning their loved ones is a ""holy and supreme mission. ""Netanyahu called the hostage/prisoner exchange deal a ""hard decision but right decision. "" He added that all of Israel's security institutions, such as the Israeli military and Mossad spy agency, support the deal. Netanyahu's comments came hours after the Doha-based Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said the two sides were ""close to reaching a truce agreement"" with Israel. Some 13,000 people in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, have been killed by Israeli attacks since the war began, according to Palestinian health officials. There are three Americans who could be released under the deal, including a 3-year-old whose parents were killed on Oct. 7, according to a senior U. S. administration official. The official added that the deal is structured so that the pause in fighting would be extended if additional people are released beyond the first 50. There are 10 Americans unaccounted for in total, the official said, though they would not confirm if they are being held by Hamas. Public support for a deal in Israel had been building and there have been large demonstrations in support of the hostages, increasing pressure on Netanyahu's government to win their release. The International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement late Monday that its president, Mirjana Spoljaric, had met with Haniyeh in Qatar, calling for ""the immediate release of hostages. """"The ICRC is insisting that our teams be allowed to visit the hostages to check on their welfare and deliver medications, and for the hostages to be able to communicate with their families,"" the aid group said, adding that as a humanitarian intermediary, it ""does not take part in negotiations leading to the release of hostages. ""Earlier, fighting continued around a hospital in northern Gaza that was hit by shelling on Monday, killing at least 12 people, according to Gaza's health ministry. NPR was unable to independently verify the casualties at the Indonesian Hospital. Israel's military says its forces were fired on from within the hospital and that it returned fire, but that ""no shells were fired toward the hospital. ""Displaced civilians and medical staff are trapped in the hospital, as Israeli troops battle Hamas fighters in the area. Israel, which insists that Hamas is using hospitals in Gaza as covert command posts, has received international criticism for attacks that have hit the medical facilities. Speaking to NPR, Medhat Abbas, a doctor at the Indonesian Hospital, said about 120 people were evacuated from the facility to Nasser Hospital in the south of Gaza. Gaza's health ministry says at least 500 wounded people and more than 2,000 displaced Gaza residents remain stranded inside. ""Anyone who does not die from Israeli bombing dies from bleeding because he does not reach the hospital,"" the Gaza health ministry said. A spokesman said the occupancy at hospitals in Gaza has reached 190%. In a status report on Tuesday, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Monday's attack on the Indonesian Hospital marked the fifth time the facility had been hit since the start of hostilities. ""This health facility is under an electrical power (blackout) due to lack of fuel and it also faces severe shortages of water, essential medicines and supplies. ""Earlier this week, Israel's military released video it said proved that Hamas had used Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, as a covert base. Al-Shifa was badly damaged and its electricity cut off during Israeli operations to capture the facility. On Monday, 28 premature newborn babies were evacuated from Al-Shifa and transported to hospitals in Egypt for treatment. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday, the U. N. World Food Program said Gaza's 2. 2 million people are in urgent need of food assistance. ""Existing food systems are collapsing, and to reach those in need, WFP and our partners need increased access and resource like fuel, gas, and connectivity. To make a real impact, we need hostilities to halt. ""Last week, the U. N. World Food Program warned that Gaza was facing widespread hunger as a result of the conflict. ""[N]early the entire population is in desperate need of food assistance,"" it said in a statement. ""With winter fast approaching, unsafe and overcrowded shelters, and the lack of clean water, civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation,"" WFP Executive Director Cindy McCain said, adding that the needs of Gazans could not be properly met with a single border crossing at Rafah, Egypt. ""The only hope is opening another [crossing], safe passage for humanitarian access to bring life-saving food into Gaza,"" McCain said.

On Oct. 4, Al-Banna gave birth to twin girls — her first children — and named them Leen and Bayan. They were born prematurely and needed extra care. So they were transferred to Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital, a modern facility with a fleet of incubators for newborns. Al-Banna and her husband visited often. The girls were getting stronger. ""They reached a stage where they were being trained to nurse,"" Al-Banna tells NPR. ""Then the war happened. ""On Oct. 7, Hamas militants crossed from Gaza into Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking about 240 others hostage, according to the Israeli government. Israel responded with airstrikes and a ground invasion into Gaza that has killed more than 12,700 people, according to Palestinian health officials. Al-Shifa Hospital filled with thousands of war wounded and evacuees. There was fighting very close to the hospital. Israel accuses Hamas of running a command center in tunnels under the hospital, and of using doctors and patients as human shields. It wasn't safe for Al-Banna and her husband to visit. At first, they were able to call the nurses and check on their daughters' status by phone. But then 4G, phones and internet went down. And under an Israeli blockade, the hospital ran out of fuel to power its generators. Al-Banna's twins were among hundreds of patients whose lifesaving machines — incubators and ventilators — turned off when Al-Shifa's electricity went out. Doctors crowded all the newborns onto hospital beds together, to keep them warm. But Gaza's Health Ministry says eight of the newborns died. And on Nov. 12, the World Health Organization said Al-Shifa ceased to function as a hospital. ""I kept thinking, 'God knows if they are dead or alive,'"" Al-Banna recalls. Occasionally, phone signals would come back, and Al-Banna says her husband managed to get a nurse to send a video of the babies that were still alive. Al-Banna says she was relieved to recognize one of her daughters from a birthmark. Then she found their names on a list published by Palestinian health officials of babies being transferred to Egypt. The girls were among some 31 newborns evacuated Sunday from Al-Shifa Hospital by medics from the Palestinian Red Crescent and the World Health Organization. They were transported in ambulances to the Emirates Hospital in Rafah, where 28 of them were deemed sick enough to qualify to cross into Egypt — to safety, and to receive the care they needed. ""They were not taken out a minute too soon,"" says Dr. Margaret Harris, a WHO spokesperson. ""It had been very difficult for the staff to give them adequate nutrition, and keep them warm. None of the babies had parents with them, so they didn't have access to any breast milk. ""On Monday, Al-Banna was reunited with her daughters at Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt. The mother sat in the back of an ambulance with her daughters, who were wearing blue fleece hats, bundled under blankets, all making the journey to Egypt together. Later, they were flown from the Egyptian side of the Gaza border to the capital Cairo for further care, Harris says. In the ambulance at Rafah with Al-Banna and her two daughters were four other premature babies. She doesn't know who they belong to. NPR counted only four parents, including Al-Banna — all mothers, no fathers — accompanying the convoy of 28 infant evacuees Monday. Poor communications in Gaza have made it difficult for medics to contact many of the babies' parents. It's not known how many of the parents are still alive. So Al-Banna says she will look after as many of these other babies as she's able, on their journey out of this war. Anas Baba reported from Rafah.

206,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/20/1214110024/hostages-deal-israel-gaza-hamas-hospitals,"TEL AVIV, Israel  — A possible deal to release some of the roughly 240 hostages seized by Hamas during last month's attacks on Israel appeared to be inching forward, but the details and timing of such an agreement remains unclear. Meanwhile, more than two dozen premature infants that had been at Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, which was damaged in fighting and has been without electricity to run its incubators, were transported to hospitals in Egypt on Monday. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the infants — part of a group of 31 evacuated from Al-Shifa earlier — had been brought to the Emirati Hospital in Rafah City in southern Gaza before crossing into Egypt. Dr. Mohammed Salamah at Emirati told NPR that three of the newborns were determined to be in stable condition and did not need to be transferred. Local television aired video of ambulances carrying the infants from Gaza across the border into Egypt. The hostage-release deal under discussion could come in exchange for the freedom of scores of Palestinian prisoners and a temporary pause in hostilities in the ongoing war that has killed some 1,200 Israelis and nearly 13,000 Gazans, according to Palestinian officials. Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, a moderator in the talks, described the remaining obstacles to a hostage deal as ""minor. "" The sticking points ""are more logistical, they are more practical,"" he said at a joint news conference with the European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, in Doha on Sunday. U. S. Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer, speaking on NBC's Meet the Press, also sounded cautiously optimistic, saying the sides were ""closer than we have been"" to a deal and that the ""gaps have narrowed. "" However, Finer noted that ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. ""Israeli media reports have suggested negotiations involve the possible exchange of between 50 and 100 women and children held on both sides in addition to a multiday pause in the fighting. Any deal would first need to be greenlit by Israel's cabinet after an involved approval process, which could take up to 72 hours, according to Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper. On Monday, there was chaos outside a meeting between Israel's war cabinet and relatives of the hostages because the room was too small to accommodate all the family members. In northern Gaza on Monday, the Hamas-run territory's health ministry said at least a dozen people were killed at another hospital during Israeli shelling. NPR was unable to independently verify the casualties at the Indonesian Hospital. In a statement, the Israeli army said its forces had taken gunfire from within the building. In response, ""IDF troops directly targeted the specific source of enemy fire,"" but ""no shells were fired toward the hospital,"" according to the statement sent to NPR. Israel, which says hospitals in Gaza are being used as covert Hamas command posts, has faced intense international criticism for military strikes on medical facilities there. The reported deaths at the Indonesian Hospital came after Israel's military released video it says proves that the Hamas extremist group was using Al-Shifa hospital as a base of operations. Israel says Hamas was holding some hostages at Al-Shifa, which is now controlled by Israeli forces, and that it had recovered the bodies of two of the captives near the facility. Jordan says it is sending a field hospital to Gaza to replace those damaged or destroyed by Israeli airstrikes. Palestinian officials said it would be the first field hospital to arrive since the beginning of the war began last month. Also, in a statement on Sunday, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said he was ""deeply shocked"" at Saturday's killing of ""dozens of people — many women and children"" at two schools run by UNRWA, the U. N. refugee agency that oversees Palestinians. At least one of the schools was being used as a shelter by civilians in Gaza, the U. N. says.

207,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/20/1214046260/gaza-palestinians-history-bill-clinton-airport,"TEL AVIV, Israel — It's hard to fathom today. But once the Gaza Strip was calm enough to host a U. S. president, and Palestinian statehood seemed a real possibility. The day was Dec. 14, 1998, and the mood was upbeat. President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Clinton stood next to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his wife to cut the ribbon inaugurating the Gaza International Airport in the southeast corner of the territory. ""Hillary and I, along with Chairman and Mrs. Arafat celebrated a place that will become a magnet for planes from throughout the Middle East and beyond,"" Clinton said. ""A future in which Palestinians can travel directly to the far corners of the world. ""For many Palestinians, the airport symbolized the larger effort to establish a Palestinian state that would include Gaza and the West Bank, with a capital in East Jerusalem. By this time, the Israelis and Palestinians had been negotiating for five years under the 1993 Oslo Accords. The start-and-stop process was fitful, but the airport was a tangible sign of what could be. ""It was the story of hope. Many people were optimistic,"" says Palestinian journalist Taghreed El-Khodary. ""My father and his friends were from the business community. After they visited the airport, my father came to our house, and said, 'Taghreed, it will happen. A Palestinian state is going to happen. Now I believe it. '""I traveled from Jerusalem to Gaza on dozens of reporting trips over the next seven years. El-Khodary knew most everyone there and was my guide. She now works as a journalist in Amsterdam, where she lives with her two kids, an 11-year-old daughter and a 10-year-old son, and that's where I reached her. I would enter Gaza in the north through the Erez Crossing, the same border post Palestinians used to exit Gaza in a bizarre rush-hour scene that began every weekday at precisely 3 a. m. Tens of thousands of Palestinian workers were allowed into Israel. But they had to pass through stringent Israeli security checks as part of a commute that could last three hours or more each way. At the stroke of 3, the crossing opened and nighttime stillness turned into rush-hour madness, reflecting the fraught Israeli-Palestinian relations even during those times when they were cooperating. A big part of the story in the early 2000s was the rise of Hamas, which would become the leading Palestinian faction, surpassing the rival Fatah movement. Though many Hamas leaders in Gaza were killed by Israeli air strikes over the years, they were shockingly casual about security. El-Khodary would call them up, and then we'd go knock on the front door of their homes. ""We used to sit and have coffee or tea and chat, trying to understand their point of view,"" she says. Their view was essentially that Israel should not exist, and they talked about it openly. In 2005, after a Palestinian uprising, or intifada, that lasted five years, it seemed Gaza might calm down, at least a bit, as Israel withdrew Jewish settlers and troops from the territory after a presence of nearly 40 years. At that time, El-Khodary was leaving for a year at Harvard in the Nieman Fellowship program for journalists. It was a dramatic change from the confines of Gaza. ""You are exposed to all this freedom of movement and universal values and all of that you learn in American schools,"" she says. ""You get this stimulation and it's just so powerful. ""Yet by the time she went back the following year, Gaza was again in turmoil. The Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the southern end of Gaza was closed. El-Khodary was stuck on the Egyptian side, unable to return home to Gaza — for 39 days. ""It was horrible just to wait. The idea of waiting, waiting and and hoping that the next day it's going to open. It was awful,"" she says. Something else happened during her time away. The Palestinians held an election — and Hamas won, overtaking Fatah, the dominant Palestinian faction for decades. It was instantly clear this would have serious consequences. Since then, Israel and Hamas have fought every few years, though the Israeli aim was to weaken the militant group, not to drive it from power or eliminate it entirely. This included heavy fighting in 2008-2009, with intensive Israeli airstrikes. ""I thought I will lose my life,"" El-Khodary recalls. During Israeli airstrikes near her apartment in Gaza City, El-Khodary huddled under a table and made promises to herself. ""One was going to Paris. To go to Paris and to enjoy life,"" she says. She did. And then she moved to Amsterdam a year later, in 2010. But her extended family is still in Gaza today and she worries about them constantly. ""I haven't left Gaza because all my family is in Gaza, all my friends. I just learned that my music teacher from elementary school was killed,"" she says. ""It's just so sad that I cannot help them. I used to cover stories. Now my family is in the story. ""She wishes they could join her. But flights out of Gaza are a distant memory. The short-lived Gaza International Airport was shut down in 2001 amid fighting. Today it lies in ruins. Greg Myre is an NPR national security correspondent who was based in Jerusalem from 2000-2007.

208,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/19/1213797712/israels-lack-of-a-strategy-is-the-strategy,"In reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I often recall a book that relates one Israeli view of it. The late Ariel Sharon, a longtime Israeli soldier and political leader, confided his thoughts to his close friend Uri Dan, an Israeli journalist. Their beliefs can be found in This Burning Land, by Greg Myre and Jennifer Griffin.  ""The bond between the two men was built on an unshakable belief. The Jews and the Arabs had been fighting for generations, and. . . no resolution was on the horizon,"" reads This Burning Land. As Sharon and Dan saw it, ""the Arabs had never genuinely accepted the presence of Israel,"" and so a two-state solution was not possible nor even desirable. They ""accepted the conflict as a permanent feature of life in the Middle East, part of the world they were born into, and part of the world they would leave behind. . . In their minds—and in the minds of a fair number of Israelis and Palestinians—if you did not accept the enduring nature of the conflict, then you did not understand the conflict at all. ""The 2010 book did not state the views of Benjamin Netanyahu, who at that time was beginning a long run as prime minister. But the idea of a long-lasting conflict helps to make sense of Netanyahu's interview Friday on NPR's Morning Edition, as well as several past conversations. Asked about the future of Gaza, which the Israeli military is now wrenching from the control of Hamas, Netanyahu said what he didn't want but was vague about what he did. When asked who will rule when Hamas is deposed, Netanyahu said that for ""the forseeable future,"" Israeli troops will have ""overall military responsibility. But there also has to be a civilian government there. ""Netanyahu pointedly did not say who that ""civilian government"" should be. He rejects the most obvious replacement for Hamas, the Palestinian Authority led by Fatah, the party that rules the West Bank. Nor did he name any other group that might take charge. So Israel wants the freedom to strike targets in Gaza when it chooses, but does not want the responsibility of governing or providing services to 2. 3 million people, and also is not ready to say who should take that responsibility. In rejecting the Palestinian Authority, Israel is rejecting a group that has endorsed a two-state solution—which the U. S. and others see as the only way toward permanent peace. For those who think that Mideast peace is the goal, this is a significant omission. But for anyone who thinks the conflict is ""permanent"" and that no solution could possibly be satisfactory to Israel, the lack of a long-term plan for Gaza is desirable. It's the point. In numerous interviews with me dating back to 2013, Netanyahu has only rarely indicated openness to a two-state solution, and not at all in recent years. He's told me instead of an idea to allow Palestinians to govern themselves only on matters of no interest to Israel, while Israelis keep all power over security matters. In a 2022 interview, Netanyahu admitted he was offering Palestinians something far short of political equality. ""I don't hide that for a minute. I say it openly,"" he said. Palestinians are just as open that they aren't interested. If Netanyahu offered no direct strategy for peace with Palestinians, he was willing to pursue peace without them. He worked for years to open diplomatic relations with Arab nations, going around the Palestinians by making peace with their Arab allies. He enjoyed significant success. And until October 7 he seemed on the verge of his greatest triumph, normalized relations with Saudi Arabia. As this happened, Israelis tried to loosen some economic controls and encourage Palestinian prosperity as a substitute for a Palestinian state. An Israeli military officer told me that until October 7, Israel believed that Hamas tacitly accepted the bargain, and that they were ""not interested"" in attacking Israel on a large scale. Hamas chose a different course. Now Israel has committed to destroying Hamas (or at least knocking it out of power in Gaza). Who replaces Hamas? If it's hard to know, and even harder to know how peace could come, that may be intentional. The question is the answer.",npr_articles/article_208.txt,npr_results/article_208.txt.json
209,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/19/1214024420/gaza-israel-al-shifa-hospital-evacuation,"TEL AVIV, Israel — A team of medical and humanitarian aid groups successfully evacuated 31 premature babies from Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza on Sunday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society announced. They were transported to the south of Gaza to the Emirates Hospital in Rafah by PRCS ambulances, the group said. The evacuation was organized by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Just a day earlier, a joint United Nations humanitarian assessment team, led by the WHO, entered Al-Shifa to see first-hand the dire circumstances of the facility, the groups said. They found piles of medical and solid waste filling the crowded corridors of Gaza's largest hospital, according to the WHO. The team saw a mass grave by the hospital's entrance and was told at least 80 bodies were lying there, the WHO said. This team's trip only lasted an hour and was ""deconflicted"" with Israel's military to ensure safe passage, the group said. In that time, they found that several patients have died in the previous two to three days due to medical services shutting down in the facility, according to the WHO. And now there are just 25 health workers for the 291 remaining patients. The premature babies were considered to be in ""extremely critical condition,"" the WHO said. The hospital reported it lost power after running out of fuel to run their generators this past week, causing the death of some patients. U. N. representatives described the formerly advanced and best equipped referral hospital in Gaza now as a ""death zone. "" Al-Shifa has transformed into a focal point of Israeli military operations in recent days. As the military increases its operations in Gaza, the U. N. team is working to safely evacuate the remaining patients at the hospital. ""Over the next 24–72 hours, pending guarantees of safe passage by parties to the conflict, additional missions are being arranged to urgently transport patients from Al-Shifa to Nasser Medical Complex and European Gaza Hospital in the south of Gaza,"" the WHO said in a statement on Saturday. ""However, these hospitals are already working beyond capacity, and new referrals from Al-Shifa Hospital will further strain overburdened health staff and resources. ""The Israeli military has told Palestinians in Gaza to evacuate further south along a so-called safety corridor. Evidence shows that Israeli airstrikes and artillery fire occur daily in the very areas Israel has said are ""safer"" for civilians. Those attacks have hit schools, residential towers and overcrowded U. N. shelters. The Israel's military has claimed that Hamas turned the tunnels underneath the hospital into a command center and used patients and staff to provide cover for its militants. On Wednesday, Israel released video of weapons it said it found in one of the tunnels, but so far have not revealed proof that it was a sophisticated command center. Hamas has denied using Al-Shifa as a command center. Earlier Saturday, the Israel's military issued evacuation orders to the remaining 2,500 people sheltering on Al-Shifa's hospital grounds. Those civilians, along with some patients and hospital staff, had vacated by the time the U. N. team arrived for their visit, the WHO said. Gaza's health ministry said on Sunday that 12,200 people in Gaza had been killed in Israel's attacks over the past six weeks. Another 4,000 people are missing ""and may be trapped or dead under the rubble,"" health authorities said. As part of the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel by Hamas, nearly 240 people were kidnapped. Negotiations over a possible cease-fire that would allow people in Gaza to move about safely and for hostages to be handed over back to Israel is still in the works. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Saturday said there was ""no deal on the table and I can't expand beyond that. ""White House National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson disputed a report by The Washington Post that said a deal between the U. S. , Israel and Hamas had been tentatively reached.

She's a strong supporter of President Biden's handling of Israel's war against Hamas. ""But I'm upset and I'm sad,"" she said. She held a sign that read, ""I'm a Pro-Israel Democrat"" at a recent march in support of Israel in Washington, D. C. Rubinstein, 75, grew up in Israel but has lived in the United States for more than four decades. In the past, Rubinstein says she's helped Syrian refugees, and pushed back against former President Donald Trump's so-called ""Muslim ban. """"We met the refugees. I said that if Trump tried to force one of them out, I would protect them in my own home,"" she remembered. ""Where are they now - where are the progressive Democrats?""Now, she feels betrayed by what she describes as ""anti-Israel"" sentiment from some left-wing Democrats. Leib Kaminsky does too. He says he's appreciated Biden's handling of the crisis, but as a gay Jewish man, Kaminsky, 57, has felt isolated by the antisemitic rhetoric he's heard from some progressives. ""It's extremely difficult being in the LGBTQ community, because they have turned their backs on Jews,"" he said. ""You try to be as open-minded as possible, but when people are coming at you and saying that Hamas is right, and they support the LGBT community, you're like - 'these people don't know what's going on'. ""In responding to the Israel-Hamas war, Biden has had to navigate complex political realities. A strong majority of Jewish Americans have consistently voted for Democrats, but the war is highlighting fault lines in the Democratic Party over Israel policy. Even so, Sam Markstein of the Republican Jewish Coalition says he thinks this could be a moment to win over some Jewish voters to the GOP. He notes that his organization co-hosted the most recent Republican primary debate. ""The Democratic Party of today has had a very loud and growing and ascendant anti-Israel voice and wing and they've been coddled and enabled by leadership for years,"" Markstein said. ""That, I think, has led to a point where you will see Jewish voters who may have never voted Republican in their lives seriously considering voting Republican for the first time ever in 2024. ""But Halie Soifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America says there's no indication of a major shift. She points to a new poll released Thursday by the Jewish Electorate Institute, in which 74% of Jewish voters said they approve of Biden's handling of the war. ""There is a misconception that is out there regarding Jewish voters that somehow because Republicans have tried to politicize this, that Jewish voters may be leaving Democratic Party or may be leaving their support of President Biden amid this crisis,"" she said. ""And that is patently false. ""While Jewish voters make up only a small percentage of the electorate, their turnout numbers are consistently well above-average, Soifer says, and many live in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Ohio. The JEI poll also found a generational divide among Jewish voters that somewhat echoes the general population: more than 80 percent of Jewish voters over age 36 approved of Biden's Israel policy, while just over half of younger Jewish voters said they did. Jay Saper is with Jewish Voice for Peace, a group which describes itself as ""anti-Zionist. """"If [Biden] is hoping to inspire young people to turn out to the polls, he cannot further support the Israeli military at this time,"" Saper said. ""We who are in the streets, who are raising our voices, will have to be withholding our votes from the president, if he continues to not call for a ceasefire. ""Biden is also facing pressure from Muslim and Arab leaders, who've also warned they will withhold support from candidates who back Israel's continued war against Hamas, begun in response to the terrorist attacks last month that left at least 1,200 Israelis dead. Since then, more than 11,000 people have died in Gaza, according to Palestinian officials. Mark Mellman, founder of the pro-Israel group Democratic Majority for Israel, says as a longtime pollster and strategist, he's skeptical of those threats - particularly with former President Donald Trump as the overwhelming frontrunner in the Republican primary. ""I find it hard to believe that Muslim Americans are going to rally behind the Islamophobe-in-Chief, Donald Trump, who instituted the Muslim travel ban and has said Palestinians should be deported,"" Mellman predicted. ""I just don't see that happening. ""At the Israel march, Yaffa Rubinstein says she holds out hope for a two-state solution that will provide a home for both Israelis and Palestinians. In the meantime, she hopes supporters of Palestinians will not abandon Biden. ""Because if they don't vote for Biden, who's going to win?"" Rubinstein asks. ""Trump. Do you know what Trump said he would do to them? And you be sure that when he said he will do it, he will do it.

211,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/17/1213579692/israel-gaza-evacuation-south-attacks,"Israeli bombardment has killed thousands of civilians in the areas of the Gaza Strip that Israel has ordered them to move to, Gaza health ministry death tolls show. Witnesses' accounts, satellite data and expert assessment gathered by NPR show that Israeli airstrikes and artillery fire occur daily in the areas Israel has said are ""safer"" for civilians, and have hit schools, residential towers and overcrowded United Nations refugee shelters. Amid its military offensive on Gaza City and the northern Gaza Strip, the Israeli military has repeatedly dropped leaflets and sent messages telling residents they must leave their homes and ""evacuate"" to areas it claims are safer, which are south of the Wadi Gaza wetlands. Families have risked journeys through the blasted landscape of destroyed buildings and corpses, along the road that Israel has designated as a ""humanitarian corridor"" through the war. For the few hours each day that the road is open, people carry or drag wounded loved ones. They push wheelchairs with patients just out of surgery in hospitals that have now stopped working. Mothers pull along weary children who look around with blank, fearful stares. But what awaits Palestinians who move south is still life-threatening. The ""evacuation"" areas are both heavily bombarded and in a dire humanitarian crisis, as Israel's blockade of fuel and control of aid into the Gaza Strip leaves people searching for food and access to clean water. ""Israel's use of the term 'evacuation' for sending Palestinians to southern areas is really problematic, because it conjures up an idea of a safe route to a place of safety,"" says Caitlin Procter, a research fellow at the Center on Conflict Development and Peacebuilding at the Geneva Graduate Institute. ""But the reality is there is no safe place left in Gaza for people to go. ""Israel has vowed to defeat Hamas and force an end to its rule of Gaza after the Oct. 7 attack in which Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials. The Israeli military says it will strike Hamas targets ""wherever necessary. "" So far, Israeli airstrikes have hit residential buildings, bakeries, hospitals and even United Nations-run shelters across the heavily populated Gaza Strip, including in the south. The Israel Defense Forces press desk, responding via WhatsApp to questions from NPR, said on Nov. 9 that it is operating to protect the security of the state of Israel after the Hamas attacks. It said it ""continues to request that all residents move south, where it is considered to be safer than the northern Gaza Strip. "" But, it says, because ""Hamas has embedded itself in civilian infrastructure and operates across the entire Gaza Strip,"" the IDF ""will strike Hamas wherever necessary. ""Earlier this week, Israel's military dropped leaflets telling residents in parts of the southern town of Khan Younis they too had to leave their homes. The IDF did not respond to NPR's request for comment on this further displacement of civilians. The dangers for those fleeing south are evident from the high number of people killed there. So far, a total of more than 11,800 people — of which more than two-thirds are children, women and elderly — have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its military offensive last month, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. A map by the United Nations' humanitarian affairs office, relying on the health ministry's data, shows that more than 3,600 people — roughly one-third of the total — were killed in areas where Israel has told civilians in northern Gaza to escape to. The latest analysis of imagery from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 satellite shows a steady increase in the number of buildings destroyed in middle and southern Gaza. Since the beginning of the conflict, over 10,000 buildings are likely to have been damaged or destroyed by airstrikes in these areas, according to analysis by Corey Scher of New York's CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University. As NPR has previously reported, the same satellite analysis shows extensive destruction in northern Gaza, according to Scher and Van Den Hoek. The majority – 94% – of the damage to central and southern Gaza appeared after Oct. 13, when the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of northern Gaza. Since Oct. 30, between 3,400 and 4,800 additional buildings have been destroyed or damaged in this so-called evacuation zone, including in the heavily populated refugee camps of Bureij and Al-Maghazi. On Tuesday, Israeli airstrikes hit a densely populated residential area in Khan Younis, killing at least 14 people. Several news reports have noted bombardments also hit residential buildings in the Nuseirat refugee camp and Deir al-Balah, both in central Gaza. Asa'd Saqallah told NPR his family fled Gaza City when his father received a call from the Israeli military saying they had to leave their home and move south. On Oct. 13, he and 16 relatives, including his adult siblings and their children, took what few possessions they could and went to stay with a cousin in Khan Younis, in the south of the Gaza Strip. Eleven days later, at night on Oct. 24, most of the family were sleeping when, Saqallah says, ""Death came. "" In a multiple rocket attack, Saqallah says, the walls of their apartment caved in on them, and the apartment above in the three-story building was destroyed. ""I started praying; rubble fell on me; my face was burnt,"" he says. Saqallah says his 11-month-old son was killed. So was his sister, her husband and their three children, ages 12, 8 and 6 months. And so was his younger brother, 18, and a cousin. Saqallah's wife, who was heavily pregnant, was badly wounded. ""When I carried her out of the building, her arm was gone and her legs were just flesh,"" he says. Doctors managed to save her and the baby girl that she has now delivered — named Mariam after Saqallah's dead sister. Saqallah, 25, says baby Mariam has given them a reason to live. But they remain broken. ""There is no emotion, no life, no feeling,"" he says. ""After everything that has happened, and we're sitting in the hospital now, how do you want us to feel?""An analysis by the civilian harm watchdog Airwars shared with NPR finds that in the first week after Israel began telling civilians to move south, the bombardment on these areas increased. The increase was part of intensified airstrikes across the Gaza Strip. The group parsed every report of harm to civilians south of Wadi Gaza in the first week after Israel told civilians to go there. Including only those events they could geolocate, Airwars gathered 127 allegations of civilian harm between Oct. 14 and Oct. 21. ""You can see that the frequency and intensity of those allegations of the attacks south of Wadi Gaza really appeared to increase,"" Sanjana Varghese, a journalist who also works as an investigator at Airwars, says of the group's as-yet unpublished analysis. The strikes on the south were part of a pattern of increased Israeli bombardment across the whole Gaza Strip, Varghese says. Many of the reported attacks Airwars analyzed in the south were around civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and restaurants. ""Calling this area an evacuation zone might technically be true,"" says Varghese. ""But it's not safe. It's not a place that people can go to and know that they'll be taken care of. ""Last Sunday, Israeli strikes included an attack on a guesthouse for staff from UNRWA, the U. N. relief agency that aids Palestinians, in the southern town of Rafah, on the border with Egypt. In this case, the employees had just left the building and were not injured. But in the past five weeks, 102 UNRWA staff have been killed — more losses than during any other period in its more than 70-year history. ""Every day we get more confirmation of more colleagues killed,"" says Juliette Touma, UNRWA's director of communications, based in Amman. ""It's shattering. It's just shattering. ""Some 830,000 displaced people are sheltering in UNRWA schools and other buildings. They live in cramped conditions, sleeping in the schoolyards or in hallways. In the most overcrowded shelters there are now over 600 people sharing one toilet. UNRWA regularly shares the coordinates of its centers with the Israeli military, and civilians come to the shelters hoping they are safe. But even these have become targets. Over the last month, UNRWA says 64 of its facilities have been damaged, including several in direct strikes. It says the attacks have killed 71 people in its shelters and injured 563 more. Over half of the U. N. agency's buildings that have come under attack are located south of the Wadi Gaza line, UNRWA says. ""This shows that nowhere is safe in Gaza. Not the north, nor the middle areas or the south,"" says Touma. ""Civilians, including children, including women, including men, including UNRWA colleagues, have been killed across the board across the Gaza Strip. ""Donatella Rovera, an investigator with Amnesty International with decades of experience covering conflicts, tells NPR the intensity of Israel's offensive on Gaza is ""beyond anything we've seen. "" Palestinian officials in Gaza say the fatalities so far include 4,407 children, 3,137 women and 686 elderly people, out of a population of 2. 3 million. Rovera says the high number of dead shows that the Israeli military is willing to carry out strikes on Hamas targets despite the presence of many civilians. ""This is why we get so many dead who are clearly noncombatants, because they are children, women, older people, people with disabilities,"" Rovera says. Israel claims that Hamas militants are embedding with the civilian population and insists it has a right to carry out strikes in its effort to wipe out Hamas. Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general of UNRWA, told an international conference on Gaza in Paris last week that ""thousands of children cannot be 'collateral damage. '""UNRWA says 70% of Gaza's population has been displaced in this offensive, and most are now south of Wadi Gaza, a tiny area only 16 miles long and between about three and seven miles wide at different points. In this overcrowded area, Palestinians now struggle to find shelter, food and water. ""People are gathering wood from the rubble of buildings where possible to make fires to cook over. They are searching for water, even digging holes to try to reach it,"" says Procter, of the Geneva Graduate Institute. Procter lived in Gaza and speaks regularly with people there. ""We can't find food and we can't find water,"" Abu Kareem, a resident of Rafah, told NPR this week. ""And we don't have the water to shower. ""Even before this war, Gaza was dependent on aid to function. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, Israel imposed what it has called a ""total"" siege on the Gaza Strip, blocking fuel and other necessities from entering. Some aid trucks have now started moving into Gaza again, but humanitarian groups say the deliveries are not enough to match the need. Meanwhile, UNRWA says diseases are spreading. And Palestinian telecommunications provider Paltel said this week its cell towers in the Gaza Strip had stopped operating for the lack of fuel, further cutting off residents from the outside world. On Friday, it announced a ""partial restoration"" of services, after receiving ""a limited quantity of fuel"" via UNRWA to restart its generators. Ruth Sherlock reported from Rome.

212,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/17/1213799815/israel-gaza-fuel,"After more than a month into its siege on Gaza, Israel has agreed to allow 140,000 liters, or about 37,000 gallons, of fuel into the territory every two days for humanitarian needs, U. S. and Israeli officials said Friday. Most of the fuel will be allocated to UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, which has said it needs fuel for trucks to distribute aid and to power water pumps, desalination plants, hospitals and bakeries. The fuel will also help power Gaza's sewage and wastewater treatment systems, which ceased operations this week due to a lack of fuel, causing aid groups to raise the alarm about the outbreak of diseases. Israel had come under intense pressure in recent days to allow in fuel, both publicly from aid groups and behind the scenes from U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other officials. The U. S. intensified its push this week, and Israel's war cabinet agreed to the request Thursday, said Tzachi Hanegbi, Israel's national security advisor. ""If there is an epidemic, the fighting will be stopped. If there is a humanitarian crisis and an international outcry, we will not be able to continue the fighting under those conditions,"" Hanegbi said at a press conference Friday. The remainder of the fuel will be delivered to Palestinian telecommunications company Paltel to help keep phone and internet service available in the Gaza Strip, which is run by the militant group Hamas. The fuel deliveries could begin as soon as Saturday, said a U. S. State Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the sensitive diplomacy. The 140,000 liters are ""obviously barely a drop in the bucket of the amount of fuel that we need,"" U. N. spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said Friday. Israel had previously blocked delivery of fuel over concerns that Hamas could steal it for military purposes. Israel also said that Hamas had its own fuel reserves that could have supplied hospitals and bakeries. Hamas has denied stealing fuel meant for humanitarian needs. But reserves in Gaza had run out, the U. S. official said. Even the limited deliveries of other aid, including food and medical supplies, had come to a halt Thursday after UNRWA announced that the lack of fuel and communications service made it impossible to manage or coordinate the aid convoys. ""I do believe that it is outrageous that humanitarian agencies are reduced to begging for fuel and forced after that to decide who will we assist or not assist, when you have such a large population in a lifesaving situation,"" UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said Thursday. Repeated blackouts of phone and internet service also have hampered humanitarian efforts, aid groups told NPR, in addition to preventing Palestinians from contacting family both inside and outside of Gaza. The fuel will be restricted to use in southern Gaza. Israel's ground invasion has focused on northern Gaza, especially the area around Gaza City, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are still thought to be sheltering. Israeli airstrikes continue to hit across the territory. ""We need the fuel to make sure that our humanitarian support staff and workers can get from one place to another. If we don't have the fuel, we can't do that,"" Catherine Russell, the executive director of UNICEF, the United Nations agency for children, told NPR. ""It does many things. It powers generators, which is what we need for the incubators in the hospitals. It powers water sanitation efforts. ""Since Oct. 7, the day of the deadly Hamas attack on Israeli towns around Gaza that left 1,200 Israelis dead, Israel's military campaign has killed at least 11,470 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, which added that communications issues over the past week have caused ""challenges in updating casualty figures. "" About 240 hostages captured on Oct. 7 are thought to remain in Gaza. Becky Sullivan and Michele Kelemen reported from Washington, D. C.

213,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/17/1213754905/young-voters-biden-israel-palestinians-hamas-war-gaza,"Prachi Jhawar stands in a crowd of demonstrators in downtown Washington, just minutes from the White House. The 23-year-old is one of the thousands calling on President Biden to demand a cease-fire in Gaza and halt additional aid to Israel. When Jhawar, who voted for Biden in 2020, thinks about him running for reelection in 2024, she says she's grim. ""We voted for him with the hope that he would protect human rights,"" Jhawar said. ""Gen Z cares so much about human rights. "" ""To have our commander-in-chief not actually follow through with that and not support that is really disheartening,"" she continued. Jhawar's comments come as a faction of progressive lawmakers and youth voter organizations are voicing anger and dissatisfaction with Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war. ""It just feels like he's not really listening to us,"" Jhawar added. Over a week after pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched on Nov. 4 for a cease-fire, tens of thousands of people met on the National Mall in support of Israel. ""We want to continue to have generations of Jewish people stay alive and the Jewish faith stay alive,"" said 23-year-old Sheindl Spitzer-Tilchin, a Jewish student who attended the march on Nov. 14. Spitzer-Tilchin, who is a Democrat and voted for Biden in 2020, says she is thankful for his response to the conflict. ""I appreciate him standing up for Israel and understanding how atrocious and how scary this can be for college students, families, everywhere in the world, not even just Israel,"" she says. As the war rages on in the Middle East, young Americans are weighing in on how the White House's response may affect their own view of politics. Millennial and Gen Z voters have voted for Democratic candidates, but against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war, some political approval is shifting. Laith Shalabi, a 22-year-old Palestinian American, is part of the crowd of demonstrators voicing support for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. The White House and Israel have both opposed demands for a cease-fire. The U. S. and Israel argue that it could give Hamas time to regroup and prepare for new attacks against the country. But when Shalabi thinks about 2024, his mind is made up. He's not voting for Biden. ""This was most definitely a deciding factor. He hasn't fulfilled a lot of his promises,"" he said, referring to Biden's handling of the conflict. Now, Shalabi says he'll likely vote for a third-party candidate. Political experts say that Democrats sitting out the election or voting for another party in protest could actually help Republicans. Pro-Palestinian protesters are angry about Biden's consistently strong levels of support for Israel and his commitment to send the country $14 billion in aid. This march comes almost a month after Israel launched a military offensive in Gaza following a Hamas-led attack on the country on Oct. 7, which killed around 1,200 people. Hamas also took more than 240 hostages. Since then, the president has expressed increasing concern for the safety of the Palestinian people living in areas affected by Israeli military offensives. The Health Ministry in Gaza has reported more than 11,000 people have been killed there. ""I'm pretty against not voting at all, but I don't think that we should have to pick the lesser of two evils,"" said Teddi Shalabi, Laith Shalabi's cousin-in-law. She's unsure who she'll vote for in 2024. But she says it definitely won't be Biden. Elsewhere in the crowd is 27-year-old Sufia Alam, who hasn't fully made up her mind about 2024. Alam, who is Indian American and Muslim, finds backing Biden painful now, especially given that Muslim voters have historically aligned with Democrats.  ""[Biden] has a lot of work to do. He has lost the trust of Muslim Americans who have been largely, almost all of us, were raised to identify with this party,"" she said, ""And the past month especially has been very, very isolating and gut-wrenching. ""On the National Mall, calls to ""bring them home,"" referring to the hostages still held by Hamas militants, echo throughout the masses of people. For Eitan Gitlan, 21, being at the march has an added weight. His childhood friend and former classmate was taken hostage. ""I felt like I needed to be here,"" Gitlan said, who is now the President of the Jewish organization, Hillel, at Muhlenberg College, ""to both support my friends who are here and also to show support that this could be over. ""Gitlan, a Democrat, is happy with Biden's response so far and took note of Democratic leaders attending the march, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N. Y. and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N. Y. . House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. was also on stage and gave remarks. But some attendees don't have that same confidence in the Democratic Party – despite being supportive of the president's handling of the situation. ""Honestly, right now, I'm broken,"" said Gitlan's friend, 21-year-old Josh Levin. ""Because I feel like I don't really know what party I'm part of. ""Though Levin has leaned toward the Democratic party, he says a lack of support from non-Jewish friends and people he grew up with has made him unsure of his own affiliation. ""I feel like the Jewish people have always stood by every other minority group,"" Levin, who is the grandson of a holocaust survivor, said, ""And right now, it seems like people aren't standing by the Jewish people. "" It's a sentiment echoed across the country in Jewish communities that identify as Democrats and have long supported progressive movements related to civil rights in the U. S. ""I feel like the far left doesn't support Israel. And Israel is an important part of who I am as a person,"" Levin said. ""I don't know if I can really associate with that party anymore. ""Levin isn't alone in feeling he doesn't belong to a party. Despite young Americans overwhelmingly voting for Democrats, far fewer actually identify as part of the party. But as the Israel-Hamas war continues, Democrats are wrestling with how to maintain a tough balance: supporting Israel while also addressing the humanitarian concerns of the more progressive wing of their party. While Biden's commitment to Israel has remained consistent, Americans' feelings toward the country's actions in Gaza are changing. Compared to the initial days after the Hamas attack, larger shares of Democrats and independents now say that the Israeli military response has been too much, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Plus – younger generations are much more split on the issue compared to older generations, with 50% of Gen Z and millennials sympathizing more with the Palestinian people than Israel, according to the poll. And there's a schism amongst all Democrats, regardless of age, the survey found that they sympathize evenly at 45% to 45%.  The issue could cause even deeper fissures within the Democratic party, which political experts say has long been ideologically united regardless of age. ""Older and younger Democrats are pretty much in accord with what they think is important and issues they favor,"" said Mike Hais, a Democratic researcher who has studied youth politics for decades. Hais points to his own research that shows Democratic voters largely agree on the importance of major social issues, including safeguarding abortion, protecting LGBTQ rights and addressing climate change. But the issue of Israel and the Palestinian people could break that unity. ""This does have the potential of being an issue where there could be that kind of division,"" Hais explained. ""I don't have evidence of it yet. I don't think it's gone far enough. But it is the first time I think I've seen the potential for a generation gap within the Democratic Party. "" he added.

214,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/17/1213130640/kibbutz-beeri-israel-museum-artist,"JERUSALEM, Israel –  From a distance, the new painting anchoring the Israeli Art gallery of the Israel Museum mesmerizes with its simple, but deep hues of red and black.  Step closer, though, and squint, and something else catches the eye: small but deep cuts, chipped into the canvas.  They're a reminder of what happened on Oct. 7, when Hamas militants launched brutal surprise attacks in Israel that the government says killed about 1,200 people. But like the artist who made it, Ziva Jelin's painting Curving Road is a survivor of one of those attacks. Hamas fighters killed dozens of people and kidnapped others, and burned and destroyed houses and other buildings in Kibbutz Be'eri, where 61-year-old Jelin has lived her whole life. But in the middle of the ash and ruin of her home, dozens of her works were found intact. ""I see these paintings as survivors. Just as we survived, they survived as well,"" the artist said during the unveiling of Curving Road over the weekend at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, Israel's largest cultural institution. Her comments have been translated into English from Hebrew. The large piece captures the desert landscape of Jelin's home, with the focal point set on a long road. It's a path that Jelin took on her morning runs in Kibbutz Be'eri. And it's the same one Hamas militants used to cross the border from Gaza into southern Israel on Oct. 7. At 6:30 a. m. that Saturday, Jelin woke up to explosions. She had planned a run that morning, but ""then the chaos started. "" ""[The attackers] came in right near my house, right near the cemetery. And it's only by a miracle that I am standing here,"" she said during the painting's unveiling in front of a small group of reporters. They turned right, away from her home, and not left. ""Like Russian roulette,"" she said. Jelin and her family quickly ran to their bomb shelter, where they sat in fear. ""We just sat for 12 hours without making a sound, only whispering. We didn't turn on the air conditioning so they wouldn't know we were there,"" she said. Finally, she and her family and the rest of her kibbutz were rescued and evacuated and sent to live in a hotel at the Dead Sea, where they remain more than a month later. Jelin said her gallery and her works were not a priority to her in the early days after the attack. They were ""the last things that I thought about,"" Jelin said. ""But afterwards, when they evacuated us from Be'eri, I said to myself, 'There's no way that anything survived. '""An artist for decades, Jelin ran her own gallery on Kibbutz Be'eri for almost 30 years. That gallery was burned to the ground on Oct. 7. A separate studio, where she kept years of work, was an old building, full of cracks. ""I was sure it had completely crumbled,"" she said. To her shock, it survived — as did dozens of her paintings, though much of it full of holes and damaged by grenades and gunfire. In the conflict that has followed the Oct. 7 attacks, the Israeli military has carried out strikes that have killed more than 11,200 people in Gaza, according to health officials in the Hamas-controlled territory, and trapped civilians with little water, power and medical care. But out of this terrible tragedy, an opportunity arose that Jelin said she likely never would have had otherwise. Amitai Mendelsohn, the senior curator and head of the Israel Museum's David Orgler Department of Israeli Art, had gone to visit survivors of the attack on Kibbutz Ber'eri and heard that some of Jelin's work had survived as well. ""I thought it would be a very, very meaningful thing to do for the Israel Museum at this moment, to display a painting that is also very powerful in its own right,"" he said. ""The tragedy obviously puts in it a lot of meaning. It's hard to look at it neutrally now. "" Jelin acknowledges that visitors to the museum now, and in the future, will have different connections and interpretations of her piece than she originally intended. She expects them to see ""fires, or massacre, blood war,"" she said. ""I respect every viewer and their interpretation. But that isn't where I'm coming from. ""  For more than 20 years, Jelin has always painted in shades of red. Using that color came ""from a place of bold feelings,"" she said. She drew inspiration from her home and surroundings in the south of Israel and on her kibbutz, where each year red anemone flowers would bloom across the desert. But now, she said, ""with the bullets, the holes, the interpretation is unavoidable. Every viewer will have their own interpretation. "" Jelin has resumed making art, and said she is driven by this tragedy and the loss of friends. She and others on her kibbutz are using art as a kind of therapy. ""I haven't stopped painting since,"" she said. ""I've never painted so much in my life. ""Orange dominates her canvases now, she said, and her subjects are the people she and her community lost on Oct. 7, like her friend Hagi.  ""When I sit down to paint Hagi . . . it's something different,"" she said. ""It's a kind of communion with the lost.

215,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/17/1213684429/benjamin-netanyahu-israel-hamas-gaza,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told NPR that Israel is committed to doing three things in Gaza: destroying Hamas, freeing the Israeli hostages it's holding and giving Gaza a different future. But the interview with Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep was notable for what the prime minister did not say: who he thinks should govern the territory with a population of 2. 3 million, now devastated by six weeks of Israeli bombing. Israel is responding to an attack by Hamas on Oct. 7 that killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. Palestinian officials say the Israeli response has killed more than 11,000. Israeli troops now directly control much of northern Gaza, and this week occupied a major hospital center. Before October 7, Israel had followed a policy of allowing Hamas to govern Gaza so that Israel would not have to. Israel now says Hamas cannot be allowed to rule. Netanyahu said Israel must maintain ""overall military responsibility"" in Gaza ""for the foreseeable future. "" ""Once we defeat Hamas, we have to make sure that there's no new Hamas, no resurgence of terrorism, and right now the only force that is able to secure that is Israel,"" Netanyahu said. He added ""there has to be a civilian government there,"" but declined to say who he thought it would be. It's unclear who would replace Hamas in the seat of government. Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority — which runs the West Bank — has said he is not interested — and Israel doesn't want that either. ""I think I know who it can't be — it can't be people committed to funding terrorism and inculcating terrorism,"" Netanyahu added. An Israeli military officer told NPR in early November that some combination of ""local and international"" forces should govern Gaza, but no candidates for this role have emerged. For all the latest developments on this story, listen to Morning Edition now. Netanyahu compared the situation in Gaza to the Allies' occupation of Germany and Japan after World War II, after their surrender, for administrative and rehabilitative purposes (such a move by Israel, however, would likely be unilateral). And he called for a similar ""cultural change"" in Gaza to those that took place in Germany and Japan when those countries transitioned from authoritarian rule to democracies after surrendering to the Allies. He added that any government in Gaza should be committed to fighting terrorism, not funding it. This week, Israeli troops closed in on Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital, which is the territory's main hospital. Al-Shifa had effectively stopped functioning due to ground fighting, fuel shortages and lack of medical supplies resulting from Israel's blocking the entrance of most aid to Gaza. Many patients, doctors and other civilians have remained in the hospital even as conditions have deteriorated. Israel said Hamas had a command center underneath Al Shifa, an assertion that the U. S. has publicly supported and Hamas has denied. But those claims have not been independently confirmed. The Israeli military said its troops found weapons and other equipment — as well as the bodies of two hostages — in the area of the complex. A Hamas spokesperson said Friday that the hostages had health conditions and were brought to the hospital to receive life-saving medical care. Netanyahu said troops found weapons, ammunition, bombs and a ""major"" command center in the hospital, which he said Israel has now taken over. He added that as troops moved in, they brought Arabic-speaking doctors and incubators with them. ""This is, I think, the most humane takeover of a hospital commandeered by terrorists in history,"" he said. The Geneva Conventions protect hospitals during war, but the safeguards are not absolute. Human rights groups continue to call for a cease-fire, which Netanyahu has said cannot happen until all the hostages are released. Human rights groups have said that even if Hamas is operating in the hospitals, Israel does not have free rein to endanger civilians there. Netanyahu said Hamas must be replaced with a government that wants to rebuild Gaza and cares for the future of peace between Israelis and Palestinians. When asked how he expects to make peace with people who have lost their loved ones — in some cases their entire families — to Israel's military campaign in Gaza, Netanyahu said ""any civilian death, and any death of any child, is a tragedy. "" He said Israel is doing ""everything we can"" to minimize such deaths, and accused Hamas of doing the opposite. Israel asserts that Hamas is using civilians as human shields in Gaza hospitals, a practice that is illegal under international human rights law. ""Hamas is committing a double war crime,"" Netanyahu said. ""It's both targeting our civilians, murdering them, mutilating them, but also hiding behind civilians as human shields. "" Netanyahu again invoked Germany, repeating his claim that Hamas are ""the new Nazis. "" Like Hamas, he said, Hitler's army implanted itself in civilian neighborhoods and hospitals, but that didn't stop the Allies from fighting it. For all the latest developments on this story, listen to Morning Edition now. ""You had to act to try to minimize civilian casualties, but unfortunately many civilians were killed,"" he said. ""Now I think history would have taken . . . a totally different course if at the time public opinion was geared against the Allies, instead of being geared against the Nazis. "" Human rights groups and many in the international community have called for a cease-fire, which Netanyahu has repeatedly said won't happen until Hamas releases all of the nearly 240 hostages it took from Israel. Americans are split over Israel's response to the October 7 attack, with a new poll showing that a majority of Democrats now say it's been too much and a majority of Republicans say it's about right. The Biden administration and the Israeli government oppose a cease-fire, saying it would give Hamas time to regroup and prepare new attacks. But the White House has advocated for what it's calling humanitarian pauses — a limited stop to fighting in a specific area to get aid in and hostages out. Israel has instead agreed to what it's calling a humanitarian corridor, essentially allowing civilians stuck in northern Gaza to move south for several hours a day. Meanwhile, a growing number of Israelis are blaming their government for security lapses that they say made the country more vulnerable to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Some officials, including Israel's defense minister and the military chief of staff, have personally accepted responsibility. Many Israelis are also angry at Netanyahu because they say he has not done enough to secure the release of the hostages Hamas is holding in Gaza (so far only four have been freed — two Americans and two Israelis). Their family members of the hostages and thousands of supporters are marching from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem this week, in the hopes of increasing pressure on the government.  Netanyahu, the country's longest-serving prime minister — who has been in office for most of the past 16 years — was already deeply unpopular in many swaths of Israeli society. Last year he invited far-right ultranationalists to govern with him. And earlier this year he launched a controversial reform of Israel's judicial system that spurred massive protests. A poll conducted earlier this month found 76% of Israelis want Netanyahu to resign. But he has said ""the only thing that I intend to have resign is Hamas. "" In the NPR interview, Netanyahu was played the voices of voters who said they were disappointed in his leadership after the October 7 attacks. One was Margalit Zur, the grandmother of an Israeli soldier. ""I don't trust the government,"" she said. ""I don't trust Bibi first of all,"" using the prime minister's nickname. Elyahu Merimy, a Tel Aviv taxi driver, said he had always voted for Netanyahu's Likud party. ""But after what happened on the 7 of October, I don't know what to think about any one from the government, from the army, from the intelligence. I don't know what to say. How a thing like this can happen? I don't trust anyone anymore. ""In response, Netanyahu said that after the ""savagery"" of the October 7 attack, his constituents' feelings were ""understandable. "" But he insisted his country is ""united today as never before. "" The broadcast interview was edited by Reena Advani and produced by Lilly Quiroz and Shelby Hawkins.

Silver was declared dead this week and was identified by her remains found at her home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel. It was thought she might have been held hostage in Gaza following the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7. Silver, 74, spent her life pursuing peace in the region, her son, Yonatan Zeigen, told NPR in October. After the war in Gaza in 2014, Silver co-founded Women Wage Peace, which lobbies for a diplomatic resolution to the conflict and brings together women from both Israeli and Palestinian societies. She also served on the board of directors of B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization. Silver regularly volunteered for the organization Road to Recovery, which provided transportation for sick Palestinians from Gaza to Israel for medical treatment. On Oct. 7, Hamas militants killed an estimated 1,200 people and kidnapped another 240 in Israeli towns, according to Israeli officials. To date, more than 11,000 people have been killed by Israel's military response, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. ""She believed in the end of this cursed conflict and that people in Gaza and in the Gaza envelope inside of Israel deserved to live in peace,"" Ghadir Hani, a friend and fellow peace activist, said at the service.

""And so did another. ""Biden, Biden, you can't hide. We charge you with genocide. ""At a recent rally on downtown Detroit's riverfront, thousands called for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war, which began after Hamas militants killed hundreds of Israelis on Oct. 7. Israel has responded by attacking the Gaza Strip, which Hamas governs. The conflict has left more than 1,200 Israelis and 11,300 Palestinians dead, according to Israeli and Gaza officials. Speaking at the event, Michigan Democratic state Rep. Abraham Aiyash said the U. S. backing Israel signals a disregard for Palestinian lives in a way that goes directly against the country's founding principles. ""America, you promised the world that all men and women are created equal. Yet somehow we find billions of dollars to dehumanize Palestinians,"" said Aiyash, who is the majority floor leader in the Michigan House. Rallygoers expressed anger at the U. S. 's stance in the war: The Biden administration has vowed to militarily support Israel, and vetoed a United Nations resolution that called for a cease-fire, though it has softened its stance in recent days by allowing a separate resolution to pass, asking for extended humanitarian pauses. While advocates of a cease-fire say it would give much needed relief to civilians living in Gaza, the U. S. and Israel argue a pause in the fighting would give Hamas time to regroup and prepare more attacks. Israel has said it won't agree to a cease-fire unless Hamas releases the more than 240 hostages it is holding in Gaza. If you asked rallygoers like Arab American business owner and civil rights activist Nasser Beydoun, President Biden has so far failed on this issue. ""Where's his humanity?"" he asked. ""Is he that much of a Zionist that the Palestinian lives don't matter to him?""Beydoun is a former Republican turned Democrat who is currently running for Michigan's open U. S. Senate seat. He supported Biden in 2020. But now, he feels that the president and Democrats are failing him and other Arab Americans, which could have a political cost. ""He lost a constituency that voted overwhelmingly for him in Michigan,"" he said. ""And if he wants to see reelection, he needs Michigan. And right now he doesn't have it. And I don't think he'll ever come back from it. ""Michigan's large Arab American and Muslim American populations turned out big for Biden in 2020, helping him clinch the battleground and solidify his win over Donald Trump for the presidency. AP reported that 64% of Muslims nationwide supported Biden in 2020, while 35% supported Trump. And in heavily Arab American counties in Michigan, voters went for Biden by a little less than 70%. Biden's margin of victory in Michigan was 154,000 votes. The state is home to more than 200,000 registered voters who are Muslim and 300,000 people claim ancestry from the Middle East and North Africa. Michigan's Arab American population includes Muslims and Christians, along with recent immigrants and families whose ancestors arrived in the late 1800s alike. But the Israel-Hamas war is throwing the support of Michigan's large Arab American population into doubt for Democrats. Because they feel the White House is disproportionately supporting Israel at the cost of the lives of Palestinians, leaders in Muslim American communities have been encouraging others to not put Biden down on their ballot in 2024. ""They are being instructed that Biden is the issue here, that he is forming the policy and that the blood is on his hands,"" said Nazita Lajevardi, a political scientist at Michigan State University who studies both attitudes towards Muslims in the U. S. as well as Muslim American public opinion. They are also consuming Arab media publications and social media posts where Lajevardi says the message is, ""The way to end this type of atrocity is to vote him out of office. ""One of those disillusioned by the Biden administration is Saba Saed, a student at Michigan State University. ""I've never really trusted the American government system, especially when it comes to Palestine, because they failed us so many times,"" said Saed, who was born in the West Bank and spent half of her life there. ""But I never thought in my life that it would be this bad, this awful. ""Lajevardi said that sentiment has rung true for Muslims across the country. She says that in her online surveys of Muslim leaders and mosques, she's seen skyrocketing disapproval of Biden since the start of the war — and at a rate higher than that of Trump, who famously called for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,"" during his first campaign for president in 2015. It is precisely because of that disapproval that crosses party lines that Lajevardi says a growing number of people feel it is not worth voting for either political party, Democratic or Republican. ""Because how are they being represented substantively? How are their interests actually being advocated for by Democrats? I think that's a very fair question that Muslims are asking right now,"" Lajevardi said. ""Not voting for a Democrat in 2024 is not as costly as some may assume it is for Muslims. ""Another student at Michigan State, Yusuf Abbas, said he's also felt ""let down"" by the White House and Democrats. Abbas voted for Biden in 2020, but seeing Biden's response to the war, Abbas doesn't hold out any real hope that the U. S. will help create meaningful change in the Middle East. ""It was never a priority for any American administration to, to try to solve the conflict in a long lasting manner, in a just manner that works for both Palestinians and Israelis, and Biden is effectively no different,"" said Abbas, whose family is Palestinian. So, for someone who was never really eager to talk politics — let alone the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — Abbas has now taken it upon himself to be more vocal about the war. As the war has taken a toll on his and his friends' mental health, Abbas said the university's Arab cultural student groups have come together in this difficult time. ""I believe in discussing things and talking about it,"" he said. ""We can sit down and maybe have a serious conversation about it and discuss what's going on, because it hurts both of us. If you're Jewish or you're Israeli, or if you're Palestinian or Muslim or Arab, it hurts both sides. ""For Michigan House Majority Floor Leader Aiyash, he's using the skills he learned while organizing for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign to try to force Biden to act — and encourages other Arab Americans to do the same. ""We do have political power,"" he told attendees in closing remarks at the Detroit rally. ""We do have the ability to influence an election. ""And he addressed the Democratic establishment and Biden directly. ""And if you are not going to take that into consideration, and are simply using platitudes while your policies perpetuate violence and harm, we will not stand by it.

218,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/16/1213299121/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-gaza-war,"TYRE, Lebanon — In this historic port city, history repeats itself in the thud of rockets and the crying of displaced children. Since war began in Gaza last month, fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militia, has flared across the border between Israel and Lebanon. Both Israel and Lebanon have evacuated for safety tens of thousands of villagers living along that border. In Lebanon, many ended up in Tyre, 50 miles south of Beirut, where they are staying with relatives or given refuge in schools. Their escape is a reminder of the cost of war in Gaza, even far from its borders. On a recent day at the Tyre Technical School, a weary-looking woman carried to her car two fabric-covered foam mattresses handed out by relief officials. In the past hour, almost 50 people had come for the thin mattresses and blankets. ""Every time there is a crisis, we don't know if we will return to find our homes destroyed,"" she says. She asks to be identified only by her familial name Um Majid, referring to her eldest child, by which many women are known in this conservative society. At 49, she has been displaced before, but this time, she breaks into tears when asked about her children, the youngest 10 years old. ""We are a people who are oppressed and abandoned,"" she says, blaming the United Nations, the United States and what she called ""spineless"" Arab countries for again having to leave their home and the ripening olives in the fields in the village of Marwahin. Lebanon and Hezbollah have fought all-out wars with each other since the Lebanese-based militia was created in 1982 — the year Israel invaded neighboring Lebanon, where it occupied the south for 18 years. This is a border created partly when Great Britain and France carved up the region after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire a century ago, sowing the seeds, many Lebanese say, of the current turmoil. Um Majid, like most of those forced to evacuate, remains adamant that the trauma of being forced from their homes does not lessen their support for people of Gaza. ""Our path is the path of resistance, whether it's the path of Lebanon or the path of Gaza. We are with Gaza, even if our homes are destroyed, and our children die,"" she says. Hussein Abdul Hussein Hussein, a spry 92-year-old, stands by as his son Amin ties a pile of mattresses to the top of the car. The elder Hussein, whose family grows olives and tobacco, says instability is a way of life in Lebanon. Even before the start of the war in Gaza, Lebanon had been undergoing the overlapping crises of financial collapse, the effects of the COVID pandemic, the explosion of the Beirut port in 2020 and political paralysis that has left the country without a president for more than a year. For those living along the border with Israel, life has been even harsher. ""After '48, we were displaced about 20 times,"" says Hussein. ""Every time Israel felt like it, they would fire stuff at us and we would pick up and leave. What could we do?""This time, on Oct. 8 — the day after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel from Gaza, killing about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners — retaliatory attacks across the Lebanese border began in earnest. In the Gaza Strip, Israel's military response has killed 11,470 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Hezbollah, which is allied with Hamas, also stepped up strikes to try to divert Israeli military resources from Gaza. ""Every time we build for the future, a crisis happens and we have to leave,"" says Amin Hussein, who notes from a mountaintop near their village they can see Israeli settlements across the border. He says family members are now scattered across Lebanon — anywhere they could find a place to stay. At the technical school, administrators have emptied classrooms on the first floor to house families while their regular students continue classes a floor above. In the school courtyard, Lebanese aid workers try to distract anxious children with stuffed toys and face painting. One of the kids, Hassan al-Sayyed, 10, has a lion painted on his face because, he says, he is a lion. Standing next to his mother, he says his family left home because he and his sisters were terrified by the airstrikes around their village. Their father, Mustafa al-Sayyed, says he left behind fields of burned crops on land his family had been planting for 200 years. ""Even the soil was damaged,"" Sayyed says. He says white phosphorus fired by Israel has contaminated the soil and water, making it impossible to plant winter wheat and barley this year until seasonal rains wash it away. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch say Israel has fired white phosphorus — used as a smoke screen but barred under international law in civilian areas — into Lebanon. Israel denies it. The classroom the Sayyeds share with another family is completely bare of furniture. A little girl with a butterfly painted on her face is sitting on a foam mattress. On the second floor, next to a classroom full of young men answering questions about car mechanics from a teacher at a blackboard, the school's chairman, Mohammed Ali Jaber, says he worries about a generation of displaced children growing up without an education. ""Learning is everything. If you leave people who are illiterate then problems will be increased more and more,"" says Ali Jaber, 62. ""This is the atmosphere here. It's not a new thing here in Lebanon. ""A mile away, in the ruins of one of Tyre's ancient ports, marble pillars rise above the sparkling water of the Mediterranean Sea. A university student and her boyfriend sit on the stone wall for some rare moments of privacy at the now-deserted site. Tyre, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. It was the center of a sea-trading empire when it was captured by Alexander the Great 2,300 years ago. Today, it relies on tourism for a large part of its economy. The ancient port is just a little over 10 miles across the bay from the border with Israel. Site director Ali Bedawi says since the war began last month, they have heard daily explosions and seen smoke rising from Israeli attacks. Despite that, just off the rocks, a fisherman casts a long pole into the bay while local snorkelers troll the clear waters. One of them surfaces to show off his find. The snorkeler, who goes by his nickname Bahar, was a Lebanese militia resistance fighter during the Israeli occupation of Lebanon and does not want to use his full name because of risk of Israeli reprisals. He pours lumps of encrusted metal from a bag — what appear to be Byzantine crosses and small ancient coins. Between the metal and balls of quartz he says were used as ancient weights, out tumble spiny murex snail shells, whose mucus was used to make Tyrian purple dye used in royal garments in Phoenician times. For almost 40 years, since he was released from an Israeli prison in a prisoner swap, he says he has been snorkeling and finding treasures in the water. He points out the sound of explosions in the distance and then black smoke rising above a hill across the Lebanese-Israeli border. Bahar says they can't hear the outgoing militia attacks against Israel, only the incoming Israeli strikes. ""We don't want war, we don't want problems, we want to live,"" he says. ""But if Israel attacks us, we will defend ourselves. It is my legal right to defend my land and defend my honor. ""Like others across the Arab world, Lebanese have been horrified and enraged by the images of Israeli strikes on hospitals and homes in Gaza. They were equally enraged after a Lebanese woman and her three grandchildren driving on a main road near the town of Ainata, about two miles from the border, were hit in an Israeli airstrike last week. Israel denied it was aiming at civilian targets and said it was responding to Hezbollah strikes. Human Rights Watch described the Israeli strike as a possible war crime. Bahar blames other Arab countries for not doing enough to defend Palestinians. ""Not one of those damn Arab countries are helping,"" he says, except maybe Jordan, which has dropped medical supplies into Gaza. ""Where is Egypt in all this? If Egypt spits, Israel will drown,"" he says, citing an old saying about the power that Egypt would have if it would only use it. In the capital Beirut, Lebanon's diverse mix of residents — including Muslims, Christians, Arabs, Armenians, Turks and Kurds — is apparent on a street corner in the eastern suburb of Bourj Hammoud, where a makeshift shrine made of glass and metal holds religious statues and a broken plaster angel's wing. Mohammad Hassan, a 24-year-old doorman from Egypt, says he placed one of the statues of the Virgin Mary there. ""I found it standing next to the garbage, so I took it and cleaned it and put it there,"" says Hassan, who is Muslim. Hassan came from Egypt to work seven years ago to send money home to his widowed mother — but now he says that Lebanon has gotten so expensive, ""it is worse than Egypt. "" If he could raise the $5,000, he says he would join his friends who are paying smugglers to get them to Europe. He asks for his full name not to be used to be able to speak openly about leaving. ""A lot of Egyptians here have left,"" he says. Of the dangerous Mediterranean sea crossing, he says: ""A lot go to Libya and then to Italy and other places. It's true that there are people who make it and people who die"". A driver wearing plastic sandals and a tattered undershirt strolls up to join the conversation. ""Our country is the most beautiful country in the world, but now all we are thinking is how can we get away from here,"" says Robert, voicing a sentiment common among many Lebanese. ""The only problem is Hezbollah,"" he says. ""There's no work here because of the parties getting involved in politics. The state can't handle them, the army can't handle them,"" says Robert, who asked that his last name not be used to allow him to speak openly about Hezbollah. But at a cafe in a largely Shia suburb, dozens of young people sit watching a televised speech by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Lebanon has always been a divided country in many ways. A young woman wearing a black chador over her clothes, gathered with her family over lunch, pulls out a photo of Nasrallah from her purse and fondly shows it to her wriggling three-month-old nephew, telling him the name of the powerful militia leader. Many citizens say there is more than enough blame to go around for the state of the country, including corrupt politicians and militias interfering in politics. But the current political crisis, coupled with the war in Gaza, has hit hardest in the markets where many Lebanese face a daily struggle to pay for necessities. ""It's been a year, there's no state, there's no president, there's no stability,"" says Helene Khodor, shopping for vegetables at a corner market. ""We don't know what's going to happen. Everyone is emigrating. The youth aren't staying. You put this huge sum of money to educate them and then they get out and it's worthless because there are no jobs,"" she says in Armenian-accented Arabic. Khodor says she and her husband worked multiple jobs for years to send their daughter to the Beirut conservatory to study piano and then for a second degree in journalism. Now her daughter's salary as a piano teacher at Lebanon's premier music school is worth only about $100 a month — less than the cost of transportation to get to her job. ""We worked hard to get ahead,"" she says, ""and then we just get dragged back. """,npr_articles/article_218.txt,npr_results/article_218.txt.json
219,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/16/1212889717/satellite-images-us-israel-gaza,"The war between Israel and Hamas is being fought, in part, through disinformation and competing claims — and satellite imagery has emerged as an important fact-checking tool. It's also putting new scrutiny on how commercial satellite companies operate in a conflict area. The questions are more pointed than ever. Not only are companies able to capture crystal-clear overviews of things like military convoys and battlefield positions; they're also able to deliver those images more quickly and widely than ever. By publishing — or not publishing — real-time imagery, private satellite firms face a risk of serving the interests of combatants on either side, in a controversial war. If that's not complicated enough, consider this: The U. S. government has a special law restricting satellite imagery that depicts Israel. Here's an overview of that law, and how satellite companies are navigating a hotly contested conflict zone:It's a unique situation: For years, federal law has limited the quality of commercial satellite imagery U. S. companies can sell — if the images depict Israel and Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories such as Gaza. It's not unusual for countries to attempt to restrict satellite imagery of sensitive locations on their own soil. But in this case, the law seeks to protect an entire — and separate — country. ""This restriction doesn't even apply to the U. S. "" homeland and territories, satellite imagery analyst Matt Korda of the Federation of American Scientists told NPR. The limit has its roots in 1996, when Congress added an amendment on satellite imagery to the National Defense Authorization Act for the following fiscal year. Under the Kyl-Bingaman Amendment, or KBA, the office of Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs, which is part of NOAA, can issue a U. S. license for collecting or distributing satellite images of Israel ""only if such imagery is no more detailed or precise than satellite imagery of Israel that is available from commercial sources"" — meaning outlets beyond the U. S. For more than two decades, the resolution limit was set at 2 meters. So as technology and access to orbit improved, U. S. satellite companies lagged behind competitors such as the EU-based Airbus in providing images of Israel. Things finally changed three years ago, when the U. S. acknowledged that, with at least a dozen companies in eight countries offering imagery far superior to 2-meter resolution, the commercial satellite sector had surpassed the U. S. 's ability to control it. So in 2020, the CRSRA sharply lowered the KBA's allowed resolution, from 2 meters to . 40 meters — meaning one pixel in a satellite image of Israel can now depict a square on the ground measuring 40 centimeters by 40 centimeters. For reference, that's around the width of the handlebars on a 10-speed bicycle. ""That's certainly enough to be able to make out what is going on on the ground at a pretty high fidelity,"" Korda said. Israeli officials were unhappy with the change. ""We would always prefer to be photographed at the lowest resolution possible,"" said retired Brig. Gen. Amnon Harari, head of Israel's space programs, at the time. ""It's always preferable to be seen blurred, rather than precisely. ""The change was a boon for researchers like Korda, who studies nuclear programs in Israel and elsewhere. While some satellite companies can collect data at higher resolutions than . 40 meters, the new limit narrowed what used to be a wide gap in quality. ""There isn't a huge difference at this point anymore between what's available for looking at the United States and looking at Israel,"" he said. But, he added, the situation will eventually shift again, as resolution on international images continues to improve. ""That being said, the fact that the KBA even exists is clear indication that Israel is treated differently than other countries"" by the U. S. , Korda added. ""To me, the availability of high-resolution satellite imagery over Gaza is practically the same as it was before the war,"" said Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, who regularly studies satellite data. There have sometimes been gaps in images depicting the war, Lewis said, but he added that the reasons could be mundane, such as technical complications or a big satellite customer, such as the U. S. military, buying an image outright — something it has done before and after the war began. But there has been at least one change in how Planet Labs, a prominent U. S. company, distributes Gaza images, Lewis added. ""The only difference is Planet had a really unusual arrangement where if I tasked a satellite, that image pretty much goes in the catalog as soon as they take it and everybody gets to see it,"" Lewis said. ""Instead, what they started doing was distributing high-resolution images of Gaza through a folder so that media could access it, but so that combatants could not. ""When asked how Planet handles distributing images of a war zone, a company spokesperson sent a statement sent to NPR saying, ""To reduce the potential for misuse and abuse, we decided to apply additional review for SkySat imagery over the conflict region. ""Planet says it's continuing to make images of Gaza available to media and humanitarian organizations and other clients, noting that it has shared detailed images that were then featured in news stories detailing the war's impact. NPR also sought comment from Maxar Technologies, another leading U. S. satellite firm, but those messages were not returned before this story was published. Accusations have arisen that satellite companies like Planet might be redacting images of Gaza. When asked for a response, the Planet spokesperson said the company ""does not censor, modify, obscure, or manipulate images. ""Korda, of the FAS, says he hasn't seen any manipulations of images regarding the current conflict. And in general, he said, the precautions taken by companies like Planet strike him as responsible moves. But if Hamas wants to see accurate satellite imagery, it has options — including imaging satellites launched by Iran. ""Governments and terrorist groups alike want all the data they can get,"" Lewis said. ""So I'm sure Hamas wants this kind of data, just as I'm sure the United States and Israeli military want this kind of data. ""Detailed satellite images were once the province of secretive government agencies. But high-fidelity satellite photos are now a regular part of the news diet for millions of people, bringing before-and-after views of everything from natural disasters to genocidal violence from around the world. And in many cases, governments and defense agencies are private satellite companies' biggest customers. Last month, Planet told its investors that two sectors — ""defense and intelligence"" and ""civil government"" — were the company's two most lucrative areas for million-dollar-plus sales of annual contracts. And Lewis notes that for Maxar, the federal government is the company's biggest client. ""It is normally the case that in a conflict situation, we tend to see fewer Maxar images because they because the U. S. government is simply buying them,"" Lewis said. ""But that's not a change, that's not a restriction. That's just a particular quirk of that company's business model. ""Asked whether, for instance, the Israel Defense Forces might attempt to buy up images of their own positions, so no one else would have access to them, Lewis replied, ""If I were the IDF, I would try to do that. ""But, he added, ""there are now so many companies and those companies are based around the world that buying up every image is going to be pretty tough. ""Satellite companies also serve a wide range of smaller customers, from nongovernmental and aid organizations to media and think tanks. They each follow their own pricing models, with costs depending on factors such as whether the user wants to view or download the imagery, or publish it. ""Anybody who actually has worked with the satellite imagery industry knows getting a price can be the hardest part of any negotiation,"" Lewis said. Often, he said, ""the cost of access can range from a few thousand dollars upward from there. ""The companies also have differing levels of capabilities. ""Planet is a company that, their whole ethos is wanting to image the entire globe basically every day. Which is incredible, right?"" Korda said. ""That is an amazing achievement. But it's a really different type of model than a company like Maxar, which has extremely powerful satellites, but they don't image as often. ""Korda says it's healthy for the public to think about where satellite images come from, and who's providing them, as he's seen an increase in countries openly manipulating satellite imagery data. ""I think that's kind of the direction that we're heading,"" he said, ""just based on how countries are already trying to sometimes censor and manipulate data when sharing it with researchers. ""And of course, if an interested party wants to obtain an image that doesn't comply with limits set by U. S. laws or companies, other options are out there, including from Chinese outlets. ""We have found that you can almost always get a picture of any place,"" Lewis said. ""It's just a matter of finding the provider who has the capacity to take that picture.

220,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/16/1213307710/gaza-doctors-al-shifa-hospital,"Dr. Hammam Alloh hadn't left Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City for days. Incessant bombings and the deluge of injured had kept doctors, nurses and other medical personnel working around the clock, often for a week or more at a time. The 36-year-old nephrologist had saved countless lives since war broke out in the Palestinian territory, but on Saturday, after leaving to see his family, he lost his own. Alloh was killed alongside his father by an Israeli missile that struck his parents' home not far from Shifa. He is now among the more than 200 health care workers who have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Another 130 reportedly have been wounded. To date, more than 11,000 people have been killed by Israel's military response, which was launched after Hamas militants killed an estimated 1,200 people and kidnapped another 240 in Israeli towns last month. Several doctors have told NPR that news of colleague fatalities initially spreads by word of mouth and is followed by official lists every few days. But as Israel's military escalates its attacks across the territory, triggering communications blackouts, it has been difficult for officials to maintain an accurate count. And as the onslaught intensifies, the list gets longer. Those who are left behind say there is little time to mourn the dead or ensure their legacies are not buried in the destruction of the violence of war. In that spirit, doctors there shared details about their lost colleagues' lives with NPR. ""These men and women should be recognized for their heroism,"" Tarek Loubani, a Canadian Palestinian emergency room medical doctor, told NPR. Loubani is a long-time friend of Alloh. The two met in 2012 when Alloh was still in medical school and a group of Canadian physicians, including Loubani,  traveled to Gaza on a training mission. They had stayed in touch ever since, aided by Loubani's frequent trips back to Gaza to train doctors and bring medical supplies. ""He was a young, bright-eyed, bushy-tailed medical student who just wanted more than anything to help the people around him,"" Loubani recalled of those early days. ""[Alloh] was always a person who could lead the charge. He was a natural born leader and such a dedicated human being. ""Before his death, Alloh regularly updated the press about the ghastly conditions at Shifa, pleading with the world not to turn away. When he recently was asked by an American journalist why he refused to heed Israel's demands to evacuate the hospital, he responded, ""If I go, who will treat my patients? . . . You think I went to medical school and for my post-graduate degrees for a total of 14 years so [I'd] think only about my life and not my patients?"" The last time the two men spoke was on Oct. 8 — the day after the war began. Loubani said they hadn't been in touch since his last visit to Gaza about a year ago. During their brief exchange, Loubani told him he hoped Alloh would stay safe. ""And I promised him that if anything happened that we would take care of his family,"" Loubani said, his voice breaking. ""It's not just that I lost my friend. The Palestinians lost their future. ""Alloh was spearheading a new nephrology program in Gaza, Loubani explained. Now that he is dead, and much of the territory's infrastructure has been obliterated, those plans have turned to ash. ""Most of these [medical professionals] — men and women — when they get killed, it's also the death of the programs that they lead,"" Loubani added. ""It's also the death of all the patients they would have had. Also the death of a system. That's what it means when Hammam got killed. "" When some of the staff at Shifa first heard that Dr. Medhat Saidam's apartment building had been demolished by an airstrike on Oct. 14, they clung to the possibility that the renowned plastic surgeon had somehow escaped. Mohamad Mattar, head of the radiology department at Shifa Hospital, told NPR that upon hearing the news about Saidam, he thought of the rare cases in which people are buried alive, beneath piles of debris, and miraculously survive. ""We had hoped, but unfortunately we received the news that he had been killed,"" he said. Even more devastating to those who knew the soft-spoken man was confirmation that 30 members of Saidam's extended family were also killed by the missile strike. One of Saidam's former colleagues told NPR that the surgeon's wife and kids were pulled out of the rubble — still alive — the following morning. It is not uncommon for a single bomb to wipe out entire families. As Mattar previously told NPR, it's tradition in Gaza for parents, children, brothers and sisters to live in the same building. As a result, one strike can extinguish multiple generations at once. In Saidam's case, he'd come home from Shifa when his sister, who had her own children in tow, arrived seeking shelter. They were trying to escape the bombing of their own neighborhood. Mattar, who spoke with NPR from Shifa hospital before it ceased operations, talked about his friend as a focused and steady man. Whenever he ran into Saidam in the cafeteria or the hospital's corridors, he said, they'd discuss cases and patient care plans. ""He was calm. I never saw him anxious or angry or shouting like other doctors — even during the other wars. He kept his peaceful and quiet personality at all times,"" Mattar said. He added that Saidam never expressed any political views. The only manner in which he was assertive, according to Mattar, was when he was advocating for his patients, ""asking for facilities or instruments from the management of the hospital. ""As the war escalated and more victims with terrible burns from explosives were rushed to Shifa, Saidam's expertise became indispensable. ""He was of great value to the hospital because we have very few plastic surgeons in Gaza,"" Mattar explained. Mattar said he and other physicians have noticed ""that during this war, for the first time, many of the victims have high-degree burns — second- to third-degree burns, full-body burns, including kids and women. "" Treating those types of extreme injuries, he said, was Saidam's specialty. Ghassan Abu-Sittah is a British Palestinian plastic surgeon who lives and works in London. He returns to Gaza each time war breaks out. Over the years, he's gotten to know several Gazan physicians, working alongside them under dangerous conditions. This time around, he arrived two days after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in Israel that sparked the current war. He said that, more than a month in, he is at a loss for words to quantify the horror he is witnessing. ""A few days ago, we found out one of the senior nurses in the main operating room was killed. Then a pediatric resident was killed. A day before that, one of the young anesthetic residents had been killed,"" Abu-Sittah told NPR last week, during a 1 a. m. phone call over a tenuous connection. In most instances, he said, he doesn't have a personal connection with the victims beyond their resolve to stay and treat those they can help. But in their deaths there is a bond, ""because it could be any of us at any time. "" A couple of weeks ago, word came through that an obstetrician from the hospital had been killed in a missile attack on her home, along with one of her two daughters. Abu-Sittah had never met the woman, but she was well liked and ""everybody in the hospital knew her,"" he said. It wasn't long before the woman's surviving daughter arrived at Shifa as Abu-Sittah's patient. ""I operated on her,"" he said, in a sigh of exhaustion. ""The catastrophe with that case is that the girl was left basically on her own. The girl is 9, with three really horrendous facial injuries, and she is the only survivor in the family. "" NPR has not been able to reach Abu-Sittah since Israeli troops entered the hospital on Wednesday. It is unclear if he has been evacuated. On the day of the interview, he was optimistic that a ceasefire would be declared. He said he hoped to continue treating as many patients as possible until that day arrived. Abu-Sittah added: ""I think people are still in shock in Gaza. I think, because it's not stopped, people aren't taking stock of the amount and the magnitude of loss that they've had in terms of family and friends and loved ones and colleagues. . . . When it's over, then we'll grieve. """,npr_articles/article_220.txt,npr_results/article_220.txt.json
221,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/16/1213400196/israeli-military-gaza-updates-evacuations,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel's military signaled an intention to expand its military campaign southward in Gaza on Thursday, and another telecommunications blackout disrupted the flow of badly needed aid, all while negotiations continued over the release of dozens of hostages. U. S. officials have been working for weeks on a deal, with Qatar acting as an intermediary. President Biden said late Wednesday he was ""mildly hopeful"" about a possible deal that could involve the release of 50 to 100 hostages, likely women, children or elderly people. The precise details of any such a deal, however, remain unclear. ""Five to six times a day, I'm working on how I can be helpful in getting the hostages released and have a period of time where there's a pause long enough to let that happen,"" he said. A top administration official on Middle East issues, Brett McGurk, is in the region this week and will be ""heavily engaged in the ongoing negotiations to get the hostages out,"" a White House spokesperson said Thursday. Israeli officials have refused comment on any potential deal. Hamas officials have signaled an openness to a deal to release hostages. Last month, the group released four hostages — two Americans and later two older Israeli women. About 240 hostages are thought to remain in captivity in Gaza since they were kidnapped from Israeli towns and kibbutzim across the border during the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel that left 1,200 people dead. Israel's offensive into Gaza in response to the attack has killed at least 11,470 Palestinians, according to health officials in Gaza. U. S. officials believe that several Americans are among the captives, including a 3-year-old toddler. Hamas says Israeli airstrikes have killed dozens of hostages. On Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces announced that soldiers had recovered the body of an Israeli hostage from ""a structure adjacent"" to Al-Shifa Hospital, the sprawling medical complex Israeli forces entered early Wednesday. The hostage, a 64-year-old woman named Yehudit Weiss, was kidnapped on Oct. 7 from Be'eri, a small kibbutz near the Gaza border, the Israeli military said. Her husband was killed in Be'eri that day, Israeli media reported. Weiss had been diagnosed with breast cancer about three months before the Hamas attack, her family members told Israeli media earlier this month. Israel's military did not provide any details about when or how Weiss died. Israeli soldiers remain inside Al-Shifa Hospital, the largest and most modern hospital in the Gaza Strip. Many patients and staff are still inside the hospital, aid groups and health officials in Gaza said, but the hospital is now inaccessible to ambulances and patients. For weeks, Israel has said Hamas used the hospital and a network of tunnels underneath it to store weapons and plan attacks. Hamas denies those allegations. A Hamas spokesperson said that dozens of Palestinians had died in Al-Shifa over the past several days, and that dozens more had been killed as they tried to flee the hospital. Israel claimed no casualties ""among the patients, doctors and civilians"" at Al-Shifa. The renewed telecommunications blackout has kept Palestinians from being able to call for ambulances, reaching loved ones and has hampered aid efforts as the humanitarian situation remains desperate, aid groups told NPR. ""We regret to announce that all telecom services in Gaza Strip have gone out of service as all energy sources sustaining the network have been depleted, and fuel was not allowed in,"" Paltel, the Palestinian telecom company, said in a statement. Doctors Without Borders said its communication capabilities were ""very limited. "" The blackout comes at a moment when hospitals across northern Gaza have shuttered because they lack fuel for electricity and enough medical supplies, and as they face Israeli evacuation orders. ""These situations impede humanitarian and medical personnel from working safely and effectively,"" the International Committee for the Red Cross said in a statement. ""Even the potentially life-saving act of calling an ambulance becomes impossible. It hampers the ability of rescue teams and first responders to reach the wounded and injured. ""Without communications, the U. N. also cannot bring assistance into Gaza or distribute critical aid within Gaza. The blackout came one day after Israel's military dropped leaflets over a part of southern Gaza where many Palestinians have sought shelter.  The flyers ordered civilians in areas east of Khan Younis, which is in southern Gaza, to evacuate to ""known shelters. "" This includes people in the towns of Al Qarara, Khuza'a, Bani Suheila and Abasan, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The order was an indication that Israel may be poised to expand its area of heavy operations beyond northern Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of people from the north of Gaza have already evacuated to areas in the south, some injured or sick, walking for hours with the few possessions they could carry and sometimes amid active gunfire and bombings. With Israeli troops all but encircling Gaza City, tens of thousands have fled from the north in recent days. A shrinking area for displaced Palestinians to shelter likely threatens to worsen the health and living conditions of civilians there. Last week, the International Rescue Committee issued a warning about the high risks of the spread of deadly cholera and typhoid in Gaza because most of the population has no access to safe and clean water. The U. N. and other aid groups have objected to Israeli proposals to create a so-called ""safe zone"" in Gaza, a temporary area where displaced civilians could safely gather and receive aid. In a statement released Thursday, the heads of 18 international agencies said they would not participate in the establishment of a safe zone in Gaza without the agreement of all warring parties and other conditions in place to ensure safety. ""No 'safe zone' is truly safe when it is declared unilaterally or enforced by the presence of armed forces,"" wrote the group, which included the U. N. 's humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, its human rights chief, Volker Türk, and its high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi. More than 1. 5 million people in Gaza are estimated to be internally displaced, according to the U. N. That includes about 813,000 displaced people who are staying in at least 154 U. N. -run shelters — a number far more than what the facilities are capable of holding. ""Overcrowding is leading to the spread of disease, including acute respiratory illness and diarrhea, raising environmental and health concerns. The overcrowding is impacting the Agency's ability to deliver effective and timely services,"" the U. N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. Jaclyn Diaz reported from Tel Aviv.

The Israeli government says that the attack killed around 1200 people, most of them civilians. And Hamas also kidnapped hundreds more, including women and children, and took them back to Gaza as hostages. In response, Israel has bombarded and invaded Gaza.

223,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/15/1213145028/israel-hamas-gaza-hospital,"TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said troops found weapons and other equipment belonging to the militant group Hamas after entering Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, a major complex that is the territory's largest medical center. Israeli forces initially clashed with Hamas fighters on the street outside Al-Shifa Hospital, killing four militants, according to a senior Israeli defense official who briefed the media on condition of anonymity. The official said troops then entered the complex before dawn Wednesday, local time, on what Israel has called a ""precise and targeted operation. "" Israeli soldiers searched the hospital and found weapons, ""technological assets"" and an ""operational command center,"" Israel's military said in a statement Wednesday. ""What we have found, I think, is only the tip of the iceberg,"" said military spokesperson Jonathan Conricus in a video released by the Israel Defense Forces late Wednesday. The military also released photos and a video of what it described as guns, ammunition and body armor found inside the hospital. The senior Israeli official added that Israel had no reports of gunfire inside the crowded hospital, where many patients are being treated and Palestinians seeking shelter from airstrikes have stayed in hallways and on the floor. Hamas denounced the actions by the Israeli military early Wednesday, and it denied the claims by the Israeli military and U. S. officials that militants were operating in or underneath the hospital. The Gaza Ministry of Health reported that Israel's operation had damaged surgery facilities and patient care rooms, and that two hospital technicians were arrested by Israeli forces. The Israeli military action comes during the third week of a ground invasion in northern Gaza. Over the past several days, Israeli forces have encircled Al-Shifa and other medical buildings in northern Gaza, demanding that they be evacuated. Conditions at the hospitals continue to deteriorate, officials in Gaza say.  Hundreds of patients and staff were still inside Al-Shifa when Israeli troops entered. On Tuesday, Al-Shifa officials reported that the hospital had buried 170 people in a mass grave.  Israel's military said in a statement that ""troops delivered humanitarian aid"" to Al-Shifa. On Tuesday, officials from the White House and Pentagon said U. S. intelligence agencies ""have information"" that militant groups, including Hamas, use hospitals in Gaza ""as a way to conceal and support"" military operations and hostages. U. S. officials have not provided evidence to back up the claim. Human rights groups say militant activity inside hospitals does not give Israel free rein to endanger civilians seeking medical treatment or shelter there. The U. S. has urged Israel to protect civilian life as it conducts military operations in and around hospitals, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said Tuesday.  ""We believe that the protection of innocent civilians is, of course, not only a priority, but it must be upheld,"" Singh told reporters. ""We do not want to see a firefight in a hospital where there are innocent civilians. "" On Wednesday, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution on Gaza for the first time since Oct. 7, the day Hamas fighters crossed Gaza's borders and killed 1,200 people in Israeli towns and military bases and Israel began its military campaign in response. The resolution urged all sides to protect civilian life, particularly children, and called on Hamas and other groups to free all hostages. About 240 hostages are thought to be held by Hamas in Gaza. The resolution stopped short of calling for a complete cease-fire, instead expressing a need for ""urgent and extended humanitarian pauses"" in order to allow ""full, rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access"" to the Gaza Strip. The United States, which had proposed and vetoed other failed resolutions on Gaza over the past several weeks, abstained from Wednesday's vote. ""Ultimately, the United States could not vote yes on a text that did not condemn Hamas or reaffirm the right of all member states to protect their citizens from terrorist attacks,"" said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U. S. ambassador to the U. N. More than 6,000 gallons of fuel were allowed into Gaza Wednesday after weeks of restrictions from Israelis, according to Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of the United Nations relief agency for Palestine refugees, or UNRWA. This comes after weeks of UNRWA and other aid groups begging for fuel to be let in and only after several hospitals, including Al-Shifa, reported they lost power after running out of fuel to run their generators, leading to the death of some patients. But in a statement, Lazzarini said Israel has ""restricted the use of this fuel only to transport the little aid coming via Egypt. This fuel cannot be used for the overall humanitarian response, including for medical and water facilities or the work of UNRWA. """"It is appalling that fuel continues to be used as a weapon of war,"" the statement continued. ""For the past five weeks, UNRWA has been pleading to get fuel in support of the humanitarian operation in Gaza. This seriously paralyses our work and the delivery of assistance to the Palestinian communities in Gaza. "" ""By the end of today, around 70 per cent of people in Gaza will not have clean water.  Key services including water desalination plants, sewage treatments and hospitals have ceased to operate,"" Lazzarini said. UNRWA estimates that 42,000 gallons of fuel are needed each day for basic humanitarian operations. The lack of fuel has affected much of daily life in Gaza as electricity blackouts continue. Fuel is needed to pump water from wells, to operate desalination plants, to fuel generators at hospitals and bakeries. At one store in Rafah, the few groceries on display — a hodgepodge of canned goods, oil, snacks and condiments — are lit by candlelight due to electricity cuts. Daily needs have become astronomically expensive, Palestinians in Gaza say. One resident of Rafah, who gave his name as Abu Kareem, said a sack of salt had risen in price from one shekel to 15, or from about 25 cents to $4 in U. S. dollars. ""I was told today because there is no fuel, there is no water,"" he said. ""Why should I pay 150 shekels [about $40 USD] for salty, dirty water?""On Wednesday, Gaza's death toll reached 11,500, according to the Ministry of Health, although telecommunications disruptions have hindered officials' ability to tally the deaths, they said. An estimated 1. 5 million people in Gaza, more than 70% of the territory's population, are displaced, the United Nations says, as thousands continue to evacuate from northern Gaza to the south. ""Our dreams were cut off, our ambitions were cut off, our savings were destroyed, our children died, and our plantations are gone,"" said Eyad Baroud, a 47-year-old strawberry farmer who said his fields and crops have been damaged by Israeli airstrikes.

224,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/15/1212913674/poll-israel-hamas-war-biden-democrats-republicans,"Americans are split over whether Israel's response has been too much or about right in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack — with a majority of Democrats now saying it's been too much, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. The results were driven by people of color and younger respondents, who were far more likely than others to say Israel has gone too far, and said their sympathies lie more with the Palestinians than Israelis. There are also clear divides on whether to fund both the Israel and Ukraine wars or to fund neither, and whether the U. S. should take a leadership role in the world at all. Again, younger Americans and nonwhites — as well as majorities of independents and Republicans — say the U. S. should focus more on problems at home. When it comes to Congress and its sprint to fund the government by Friday, the survey found that new House Speaker Mike Johnson is largely unknown, but respondents said he should compromise with Democrats. Republicans, however, are split on whether that should be the case. Big majorities said it's not appropriate to use the threat of a shutdown as leverage during budget negotiations. Republicans, though, were more than twice as likely than Democrats to say use it. If the government does shut down, Republicans are more likely to get the blame, the poll found. Israel has responded to Hamas' attack with as massive show of force that has killed more than 11,000 people, according to Palestinian officials, the vast majority of them civilians. The poll found Americans divided over Israel's military actions. Thirty-eight percent said the Israeli response has been too much, while an equal number said it's been ""about right. ""The number of people who said the response has gone too far is up 12 points from a month ago. A majority of Democrats now say the response has been too much. There are big racial and generational divides. ""Too much"" aligns with pro-Biden groups. ""About right"" lines up with pro-Trump groups. By a 61%-30% margin, respondents said their sympathies lie more with Israelis than Palestinians, but that's driven by Republicans (79%) and independents (67%), who overwhelmingly support Israel. Democrats are split, 45%-45%. Again, there are big racial and generational divides. Some 36% said they don't want to authorize funding for either war, fueled by independents (49%) and Republicans (40%). Independent women were the most likely to say fund neither war (58%), 17 points higher than men who identified as politically independent. About an equal share — 35% — said they wanted to fund both wars, another 14% only want to provide funding to Israel and 12% only to Ukraine. There was a big age and racial gap here, too. Older voters and college-educated women were most likely to say fund both. There were big splits over whether United States should continue to play a leadership role in the world. The divides were again most acute by party, race and age. When it comes to the Israel-Hamas war, 55% said they disapprove of Biden's handling of it, 3 points worse than last month. Overall, Biden's job approval rating is languishing at just 42%. That cynicism extends beyond Biden, though. Democrats will feel good about the fact that people think they're more unified than Republicans by a 60%-27% margin. Newly minted Speaker Mike Johnson is still not well-known — 46% say they don't know who he is or are unsure what to think. But by a huge margin — 67% to 27% — respondents said they think it's more important for Johnson to compromise rather than stand on principle even if it means gridlock. Three-quarters say it's not acceptable to threaten a shutdown to achieve their goals in a budget negotiation by a 75%-23% margin. If the government shuts down, Republicans would get more of the blame. Parties share responsibility for the national debt, respondents say. Methodology: The survey of 1,429 adults was conducted Nov. 6-9 by the Marist Poll by phone, both cell phones and landlines using live interviewers, by text or online in both English and Spanish. The margin of error is + or - 3. 4 percentage points, meaning results could be about 3 points lower or higher.",npr_articles/article_224.txt,npr_results/article_224.txt.json
225,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/14/1212845254/gaza-hospitals-update-israel-hamas-war,"TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said early Wednesday that it is carrying out an operation against Hamas inside Al-Shifa Hospital, the major complex in Gaza City that is the territory's largest medical center. In a posting on social media, Israel's military said it was launching ""a precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area"" of the hospital complex. The operation was being carried out based on intelligence information, the military said. Israel had previously said that Hamas militants were embedded in the hospital, a claim that U. S. officials repeated. Conditions in the hospital complex have recently worsened, as the complex has run out of fuel to power its generators. On Tuesday, the White House said its own intelligence showed that Hamas has used hospitals in Gaza, along with tunnels buried underneath, to plan operations and store weapons. But it did not provide evidence. ""We have information that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad use some hospitals in the Gaza Strip, including Al-Shifa, and tunnels underneath them to conceal and to support their military operations and to hold hostages,"" said National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One. For weeks, Israeli officials have said that Hamas is headquartered in an extensive network of tunnels buried underneath Al-Shifa. Hamas has denied the allegations. And rights groups have said Israel still needs to refrain from attacks that endanger civilians. As Israeli troops encircle the hospital in Gaza City, conditions there and at other medical facilities in northern Gaza have worsened to unimaginable levels, health officials and humanitarian groups on the ground say. Hundreds of medical staff and patients remain in the Shifa complex, Palestinian officials and aid groups say, along with thousands of Palestinians who have sought shelter from Israeli airstrikes there, although many have fled in recent days. On Monday, President Biden called for ""less intrusive action"" around Gaza's hospitals as Israel's ground invasion continues. ""Hospitals must be protected,"" he said at the White House, adding that the U. S. is engaging in an ongoing effort to ""get this pause to deal with the release"" of some 240 hostages still held by Hamas. On Tuesday, officials at Al-Shifa reported that the hospital had buried 170 people in a mass grave. Without power to operate incubators or other life-saving medical equipment, hospital officials say that bodies are decomposing in its courtyard and babies are dying. There is no water or food for patients or staff at Al-Shifa, according to Palestinian health officials. ""Our staff is saying there is no electricity,"" said Paul Caney, an emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, which has several medical teams working at the hospital. ""People are staying in the corridors because of sniper fire near the windows and that they cannot move any of the patients to ambulances. ""There are more than 600 inpatients at Al-Shifa, including 37 babies and at least one patient in need of an ICU, the organization said, citing one of its surgeons who is inside the hospital. The surgeon described the situation as ""inhuman. ""Hospitals have run out of fuel to power their generators, including Al-Shifa and Al-Quds in the north of Gaza, and have ceased to function as medical facilities. Israel has blocked the delivery of fuel into Gaza, saying that Hamas has sufficient stores of fuel for hospitals and new deliveries could be stolen by militants. Of the hospitals in northern Gaza, where fighting has been most intense, Al-Ahli Hospital ""is reportedly the sole medical facility able to receive patients, amid increasing shortages and challenges,"" the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. Across Gaza, 22 of the territory's 36 hospitals are ""non-functional due to lack of fuel, damage, attacks and insecurity,"" the World Health Organization said Tuesday. Officials report a rising death toll as Israel continues its siege on the region in response to the Oct. 7 attacks by the militant group Hamas that killed 1,200 Israelis. More than 11,300 Palestinians in Gaza have died, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. An additional 196 Palestinians in the West Bank have died since Oct. 7, Palestinian officials say. For the third day in a row, the Ministry of Health said there have been challenges in updating the tally due to communications disruptions. Without fuel, Gaza's youngest patients are suffering the most. Al-Shifa ran out of fuel on Saturday, hospital officials say. Three premature babies have died since then, according to health officials in Gaza. Early Tuesday, the Israeli military said it had offered to transfer incubators to Al-Shifa Hospital from a hospital in Israel in a display of what it said was the military's commitment to distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters as its operations in Gaza unfold. ""The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is willing to work with any reliable mediating party to ensure the transfer of the incubators,"" a military statement said. The military also released what it described as a recording of a phone call between an IDF officer and the director-general of Al-Shifa Hospital in which the two parties apparently agree to the transfer of 37 incubators and four respirators for children. The authenticity of the recording could not be independently verified. The continued fighting has also meant other injured patients and displaced Palestinians who fear evacuating to the south are crowded into hospitals in the north for shelter. Israel says it has focused on some hospitals in Gaza because it says Hamas is operating from military facilities underneath them, an allegation Hamas denies. On Monday, the Israeli military released a video showing what it claimed to be Hamas tunnels underneath Al-Rantisi Hospital. Israeli military officials said that they found weapons under the hospital, which they said is evidence of Hamas' operations there. NPR cannot independently confirm these details. Hamas denies that it used the hospital as a military headquarters. Gaza health officials said the basement was ""included in the design of the hospital and includes the administration and hospital stores. It has become a shelter place for displaced people fleeing the bombing to take shelter inside the hospital. ""As northern Gaza's hospitals go dark, one facility remains: Al-Ahli Hospital, according to the U. N. and Palestinian health officials. Through spotty connection over Zoom late Sunday, British-Palestinian Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitta told the press and international medical community that he is treating patients in a nearly impossible situation at Al-Ahli. Sitta was speaking in a call organized by the Palestine Children's Relief Fund. He said the hospital was dealing with more than 500 wounded and has just three operating rooms, no access to a blood bank, no morphine or ketamine to help patients deal with pain and physically and mentally exhausted staff. ""You know, I did an amputation on a 6-year-old yesterday, her arm and her leg. My colleagues were working in the other room on a kid with shrapnel in his abdomen,"" Sitta said. ""And colleagues told me he has no surviving family. So now the family in the bed next to his are looking after him. ""He compared the situation facing the doctors and nurses at the hospital to what medical staff were dealing with in World War I. He said, ""The situation is beyond dire.

226,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/14/1212836719/ex-idf-soldier-calls-for-international-intervention-to-stop-settler-violence,"It wasn't long after Ori Givati became a combat soldier in the Israeli army in 2010 that he began to question his mission. He spent much of his time not acting on specific security threats in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, but making sure ""all of the Palestinians feel like they cannot lift their heads up,"" he told Morning Edition's Leila Fadel. Givati, 32, is now advocacy director for Breaking the Silence, a group made up of Israeli military veterans who are against their country's occupation of Palestinian territories. They collect testimony from former soldiers to educate the public on how the occupation is enforced. While much of the world's attention including Givati's is on Gaza, where Israel has been waging a punishing response to the Oct. 7 attack on several Israeli communities, he is also alarmed by what's happening in the other Palestinian territory where he once served — the West Bank. Settler violence aimed at Palestinians has surged and reached record levels there in the weeks since the war between Israel and Hamas broke out, according to the United Nations and several rights groups. Scores of Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and more than a dozen Palestinian communities have fled in fear of attack in the last month alone, which is almost twice as many as last year. Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights group, says 90% of attacks are closed without an indictment being filed. Givati says none of this is surprising. Below are some highlights from NPR's interview with former Israeli soldier Ori Givati. Answers have been edited and condensed for clarity and length. On how he views the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on IsraelI'm talking to you now probably in the most devastating time in my life as an Israeli, as an activist, as a person, human being seeing the atrocities of Oct. 7. You know, some of my family members were texting me from their basements that there are terrorists in their home. Luckily they survived, but that was the kind of text I received on Oct. 7. But at the end of the day, I think this is precisely what we have to remember when we talk about the concept of managing the conflict. The concept that we will maintain millions of people under our military occupation indefinitely—it failed. We have been saying it failed because we know how it works as soldiers who were sent to maintain it, to extend it, to entrench it. It failed before Oct. 7, but now more than ever, we know it failed. That means we have to change course. Because at the end of the day it doesn't matter how many Palestinians we will kill in this war in Gaza, there will be Palestinians in Gaza. It doesn't matter how many Palestinians we kill or arrest or settlers expel from their homes in the West Bank, there will be Palestinians in the West Bank. So, the only viable future here is to change course, we don't want to see more bloodshed. Of course Israel has the right to defend itself after the atrocities of Hamas. It's not a contradiction. We have to do what we need to protect our citizens, but we have to make sure that what we are doing has a political goal, a political end. On the relationship between settlers and the Israeli militaryI joined to be a combat soldier because I wanted to protect my country, my friends and my family. When I see the military that I joined used as an employee of the settler movement, this process is terrifying for me. It's already devastating for the security of Israel itself. You don't have the order to stop violent settlers. What you do have orders for is to protect the Jewish community. We don't have orders as soldiers to protect everyone in the area. We have hundreds of testifiers. None of them said that they received an order to detain a settler attacking a Palestinian, even though it's the most simple order. On how Israeli soldiers show Palestinians ""who's the boss"" Occupying millions of people for decades means you control their everyday life. The first command I received as a soldier in the West Bank was to make all of the Palestinians feel like they cannot lift their heads up. We have to make sure that they know who's the boss. How do we do that? We make sure that all of the Palestinians cannot pass a day without understanding who is controlling them. For example, one of the missions is called a mock arrest. A mock arrest is when a group of soldiers invades a Palestinian home in the middle of the night, arrests one of the family members. It can be a few minutes, sometimes it's a few hours. They choose, with intelligence, the home of a family that is not violent; they arrest the father, usually, and then bring them back because they're just training for a future mission. Imagine the impact of this mission to the kids, to the wife, to the family. On settler violence against Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West BankThe violence is not new. It didn't start during this war. It started in 1967 from the first day of the occupation. But today, what we're seeing in the West Bank is the peak of this violence. To understand the violence we have to understand what's behind it. Violent settlers understand that by attacking a Palestinian community in a rural village, if they do it with enough persistence and with enough interruption they can make them move away. Violent people exist everywhere, criminals exist everywhere. But what we are seeing today is a phenomenon of settlers attacking Palestinians while the military, which is supposed to protect the Palestinians, is actually protecting the attackers. Palestinians in these communities are left with zero protection of their families, of their lands, of their culture, and are basically left with no options, leaving sometimes decades-old communities. On why he finds the surge in settler violence ""terrifying"" for IsraelHow can we get even a step closer to a peaceful future when we give the violent settlers weapons and when they are in the government? (Givati is referring to the Minister of Police, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has been convicted of crimes like incitement to racism, destroying property and supporting an Israeli terrorist organization)In order for us to get any better from this situation, we have to do the opposite. We have to arrest violent settlers, not give them weapons. And we are not doing this. And that's why it's so scary for me, because it's becoming harder to understand the future we're moving towards. On the Israeli government and the international community's responsibilityThroughout the years, we heard all of our leaders — and I'm not talking only about Netanyahu; I'm talking about the people who are considered more moderate — saying condemnations about settler violence and how there are rotten apples and how we must stop them, all while doing nothing about it. Nothing. Now, Biden's statement [in which he said attacks by ""extremist settlers"" amounted to ""pouring gasoline""] on the Middle East is very important. But to prevent forcible transfer, which is happening every day in the West Bank, we need more than words. We are now in a place where, without direct intervention from the international community, the forcible transfer of Palestinians will go on and on. We're now seeing settlers exploiting the fact that eyes are on Gaza. Intervention can be anywhere from limiting the weapons to the settlers, to differentiation of settlements and labeling products, all the way to sending international forces to the West Bank. All of these options are there. The international community knows what to do, and they have to start using the many tools they have on their table right now.

227,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/13/1211987812/israel-hamas-west-bank-gaza-war-conflict-idf,"WEST BANK – There are days when you head out to report a story, and you think you know where it's going. And then it spins in an entirely different direction. This is the story of one such day last Tuesday in the Israeli-occupied West Bank – the other Palestinian territory. It's morning as our NPR team is traveling from Tel Aviv to the West Bank to see a small town called Deir Istiya, and to meet a 54-year-old farmer named Ayoub Abuhejleh. When we arrive at his home, he invites us inside and makes us Arabic coffee. Like many Palestinians in the West Bank, he tells us he hasn't been able to access his land and harvest his olives. ""I planted around 370 olive trees [and] grapes, figs, almonds,"" he tells us. It's harvest season, and while his plants are groaning with fruit, he says he hasn't been able to harvest a single olive. ""We faced a little bit of problems before in the harvest season, but in this season it's terrible,"" he says. He explains that soldiers with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and West Bank settlers have blocked him from his land since the war started on Oct. 7, when Hamas fighters attacked Israel.  While the world has focused on Israel's response in Gaza, violence in the West Bank is also spiking. Attacks on Palestinians by the Israeli military and settlers are up, according to the UNOCHA, which estimates more than 170 Palestinians have been killed and more than 2,600 injured in the West Bank since the war began. The IDF says it is conducting raids on militants. Abuhejleh says that when he tries to get to his olive trees, the war is the reason Israeli soldiers point to for stopping him. He is convinced they are using the war as an excuse to seize Palestinian land. Abuhejleh planted his trees in 2011, and this was the first year he was going to be able to harvest them. When he went to check on his trees Oct. 13, he found the dirt road he normally takes to his fields undrivable. He tells us that settlers rolled in with diggers, tore up the dirt road to his fields and severed the water lines he'd installed – an accusation that NPR was unable to confirm. He has not set foot on his land since. ""I am raising these olive trees like my children. So it's not the issue of income,"" he says, explaining that he has another full-time job with a non-government organization. ""It's our land, you know? The connection of the trees, the soil, the stones – this is the important [thing]. ""The olive harvest does represent a key supplement for family incomes in the West Bank. According to Abuhejleh, many families pass down their land for generations. He hopes his children will farm his land one day. This is how it works around here, says Dana Sharon, a rabbi from a kibbutz in central Israel. Rabbi Dana is Israeli and with a group called Rabbis for Human Rights. She and her colleague Dani Brodsky, the director of the organization's Occupied Palestinian Territory department, have joined us on our trip to Abuhejleh's home. Rabbis for Human Rights works with Palestinian farmers during the olive harvest to try to help farmers access their land safely. ""There is no other place to be as far as I'm concerned,"" Sharon says. ""The way things here are managed or mismanaged is beyond awful. I just want to make a very clear statement – not on my behalf, definitely not on behalf of my religion. ""Abuhejleh offers to show us his land – not walk on it, but just glimpse it from a nearby hill. He says he does this often to check if his plants have been damaged. We follow Abuhejleh in his car down a steep and winding dirt road. When we get to the valley, we stop and park. Abuhejleh points to tumbled rocks and a gaping hole in the road. ""So they damaged there, as you see,"" he says. ""Three times they damaged the road. "" The irrigation line that he mentioned is visibly cut in two. Our team pulls on helmets and flak jackets marked ""PRESS"" in big white letters before we begin to walk with Abuhejleh to the spot that he says looks onto his fields. We hear a buzzing sound, and when we look up, we spot a drone hovering about 60 feet above us. A camera flashes green and red – it's clear someone's watching. We're just not sure if it's Israeli military personnel or settlers. As we walk another 100 or so yards, people in uniform emerge from behind a rocky hillside. More arrive in an SUV. We stop and announce ourselves: ""Media. Press. "" They're clearly unhappy with us. Some have their faces covered with balaclavas. Soon about a dozen people in uniform are gathering around us – all of them carrying large assault-style guns. ""OK. So get out of here. Take your legs and go all the way back,"" one soldier says in Hebrew, pointing to the direction from which we came. They tell us we've crossed a barrier, but we point out there is no rope, no signs, nothing to indicate that. They insist the area is restricted, and it's a time of war. Our local producer Sawsan Khalife, along with Rabbi Dana and Brodsky try to talk to them in Hebrew. Crosstalk evolves into yelling. Abuhejleh is separated from the group, about 20 feet away, accompanied by multiple soldiers. They tell us they need to question him, and it will only take a few minutes. We say we don't want to leave without him. ""Can one of our Israeli friends stay here?"" we ask. The soldiers refuse, and a gun is raised. It points straight at us – and we begin to back away. ""Move on,"" we're told. Soldiers walk Abuhejleh out of sight around a hill, and as we make our way back to where the road was dug up, Rabbi Dana tells us she's worried. ""We've never seen anything like this before,"" she says. ""This is not according to any protocol that we're familiar with or are experienced with. ""Brodsky begins making calls – lawyers, the IDF, the local police – anyone who might be able to figure out Abuhejleh's status. We call our contact with the IDF, who says they will check on the situation. We don't want to leave Abuhejleh, and so the waiting begins. What was promised as a few minutes becomes 30 minutes. Then 45. Then 90. What appears to be the same drone comes back, flying lower, with its camera pointed at us. Eventually, our IDF contact calls back. He assures us that Abuhejleh is safe, and he strongly advises us to leave the area ""for our safety. "" So, reluctantly, we do. From there, we head to Feras Diab's office, the mayor of Deir Istiya. We had called him from the hillside, to see if he could help. He tells us he is also a farmer like Abuhejleh, with 160 olive trees. He says he has run into the same issues trying to harvest. Big portraits of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the current Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, hang on his wall at town hall. We ask the mayor why scenes like the one we just witnessed are unfolding in fields all around his town, and why he thinks Israeli soldiers are doing this. ""This is an old thing that we are seeing in a new way,"" he says in Arabic. ""Their goal, their aim, is the land. And they're using the war in order to seize the land. "" From the mayor's office, we return to Abuhejleh's house to speak to his family. It's tense. Everyone is worried. Then, more than five hours after Ayoud was detained, a cell phone rings – he has been released. Abuhejleh's sister bursts into tears of relief. She tells us in Arabic: ""You Americans. Look at what's happening to us Arabs here, to our people, to our land. ""Abuhejleh's son drives to pick him up, and we wait with his extended family – children, grandchildren, sisters. And then, a celebratory horn honking is heard over the hill, coming towards his house. Abuhejleh gets out of the car, smiling, and he's rushed by his entire family – his young grandchildren run to him. He hugs and kisses them. Some are crying. We sit down with Abuhejleh to make sure he's OK and to ask what happened after he was separated from us. He tells us that after he was led away, blindfolded and handcuffed, he was driven to a military office in a nearby settlement where he was mocked and questioned for hours. ""They say it's our land. It's not your land. So you must forget it,"" he says. Later, when we would ask the IDF why he had been detained, they would provide no comment. Now that he's home, he assures us he's unharmed. And as we're about to leave, we ask if he plans to go back to see his land, even after today's incident. ""I will go back. Don't worry,"" he says. ""They will arrest, and I will return back – until I will fix my land. It's our land.

228,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/13/1211781246/unrwa-aid-gaza-palestinians-israel,"The main U. N. agency in Gaza has been called a ""lifeline for Palestinian people in Gaza"" and has been instrumental in sheltering displaced people and providing other critical assistance to Palestinians during the war between Israel and Hamas. Now, it's in turmoil after it fired several employees following allegations they were involved in the Hamas attacks in Israel on Oct. 7 that killed about 1,200 people. UNRWA, formally known as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, employs 13,000 people in Gaza alone. Here's an overview of the organization, its history and the current allegations. UNRWA was formally established in 1949 by U. N. resolution and tasked with carrying out direct relief to 700,000 Palestinians who were displaced by the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. For over 70 years, the U. N. General Assembly has continued to renew UNRWA's mandate, instructing the agency to provide health care, housing and financial assistance to Palestinian refugees throughout Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Before the latest conflict began, education made up the bulk of UNRWA's funding, with the agency running schools for half a million school-age children. UNRWA's services are available to those who are registered as a Palestinian refugee, which the agency defines as a person whose ""normal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict. ""The descendants of male Palestinian refugees, including adopted children, are also eligible. According to the agency's website, more than 5. 9 million people are currently registered under that criteria, including roughly two-thirds of the estimated 2. 3 million people living in Gaza. The agency says it employs more than 13,000 aid workers, including refugees themselves, in the Gaza Strip alone. Those workers operate more than 150 permanent and temporary shelters and run 80 mobile health teams, including some that have been damaged or destroyed in the most recent conflict. It is unclear exactly what the employees did, but UNRWA said it was ""taking swift action"" after Israel presented it with evidence that 12 people who worked for the organization took part in the Oct. 7 attacks. Neither Israel nor the United Nations immediately provided further details about the allegations. UNRWA said of the 12 people implicated, nine were fired, one was confirmed dead, and they are looking into the identity of two others. In a statement to NPR, the Israeli military said it found incriminating evidence that several of the agency's employees were involved in the Hamas attack and that U. N. facilities were actually used for terrorist purposes. UNRWA has asked the U. N. 's Office of Internal Oversight Services to conduct an investigation. It's unclear how long that will take, and it's also unclear how long the agency can continue to operate with its current funding. Over 90% of UNRWA's funding comes from ""voluntary contributions"" from U. N. member states, according to recent financial data. In 2022, the agency says it received over $1 billion in total pledges. With a contribution of $344 million, the U. S. was the largest individual donor in 2022, followed by Germany and other European countries. Almost immediately after the employees were fired last week, the United States said it was pausing its funding while it looked into the allegations. Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and Italy followed suit. Last year, the U. S provided $422 million to the agency. As of Jan. 27, UNRWA said nine countries had temporarily suspended their funding. ""While I understand their concerns – I was myself horrified by these accusations - I strongly appeal to the governments that have suspended their contributions to, at least, guarantee the continuity of UNRWA's operations,"" said U. N. Secretary-General António Guterres. The Jordanian king has urged countries to continue funding to UNRWA. UNRWA said that 2 million people in Gaza depend on the aid that the organization delivers. It said that if funding is cut off, UNRWA will not be able to meet the needs of Palestinians in Gaza through February. The agency estimates that up to 1. 7 million people are sheltering in or near its facilities, which include schools and aid warehouses. UNRWA has been coordinating convoys of food and medical supplies into Gaza. ""It would be immensely irresponsible to sanction an Agency and an entire community it serves because of allegations of criminal acts against some individuals, especially at a time of war, displacement and political crises in the region,"" UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini said in a statement. For many of these countries, the incentive for funding UNRWA is maintaining a sense of stability in the region, said Anne Irfan, a lecturer at University College London who studies the international refugee system. ""Historically, the primary concern, certainly on the part of the U. S. , was that Palestinian refugees might be susceptible to communist recruitment,"" she told NPR in an interview last week. These days, some politicians have swapped the word ""communist"" for ""terrorist,"" the official U. S. designation for Hamas fighters. But the rationale remains similar. Irfan compared it to the Marshall Plan, the U. S. policy of providing financial aid to Western European countries following World War II. But over time, support for the strategy has, at times, given way to political pressure. In 2018, the Trump administration withheld millions of dollars in aid funding for UNRWA and other Palestinian aid groups. Administration spokespeople said the holdup would pressure UNRWA to undergo reform, but the then-president tweeted that the cuts were related to Palestinian leaders refusing to ""talk peace. ""Under the Biden administration, the U. S. has resumed funding for UNRWA and other Palestinian aid groups, but has also seen that aid criticized by congressional Republicans, creating a permanent layer of uncertainty for UNRWA's operations. Even before the latest war broke out, UNRWA's funding was so unstable that it put the agency at risk of unraveling, according to a report from the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit think tank that advocates for resolving armed conflict. On Oct. 7, Hamas-led militants crossed from Gaza into southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking over 240 hostages, according to counts from Israeli authorities. Israel has responded with a total siege, heavy bombardments and a ground offensive in Gaza that have killed more than 26,000 Palestinians and displaced many more, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. When it comes to the latest conflict, UNRWA is not solely administering aid to those that remain in the territory, but also actively trying to get more of that aid into Gaza. Israeli defense forces have closed all but one border crossing into Gaza and are imposing strict limits on what can pass through out of concerns that Hamas, which rules Gaza, might co-opt the supplies to further its own fighting. An average of 30 trucks a day have passed through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt since the first aid trucks entered Gaza on Oct. 21, but UNRWA says that's nowhere near what's needed to meet demand. The agency has placed a special emphasis on the lack of fuel, which it says is needed to power generators for everything from hospitals to water treatment plants. In a more big-picture sense, UNRWA has backed a call for an ""immediate humanitarian cease-fire,"" a permanent cessation of violence to stop what it called the ""horrific"" and ""unacceptable"" killing of civilians. Among the fatalities in over a month of war in Gaza are at least 99 UNRWA aid workers, the agency's commissioner said at an international conference on Thursday. ""That's the highest number of U. N. aid workers killed in such a short amount of time,"" Lazzarini said. And UNRWA officials confirmed to NPR on Wednesday that at least one-third of the staff were killed south of the Wadi Gaza line. Israeli leaders had told civilians in Gaza to relocate to that southern area for safety as they stepped up attacks in northern Gaza. Israel affirmed UNRWA's ability to operate in Gaza with ""the full co-operation of Israel authorities"" in a 1967 agreement. Its commitment to that agreement is ""begrudging"" but necessary, as Irfan, the University College London scholar, describes it. ""On the surface, Israel is really critical of UNRWA,"" she said. But behind the scenes, ""they see it as preferable to the alternative. UNRWA provides the services which would otherwise come under Israel as the occupying power. ""Following a deadly round of fighting in 2007, Israel implemented a strict land, air and sea blockade on Gaza, which not only limited the region's economic prospects but has severely limited the inflow of basic goods like food and medicine over the last decade and a half. Even before the latest war broke out, the aid that UNRWA was delivering was ""in some cases, really basic, essential stuff,"" Irfan said. ""It's water rations or food provisions — stuff we would probably consider emergency relief. ""But Israeli politicians, including current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have at times called for UNRWA's dismantling, saying that the agency does the work that should be done by a government that includes elected Hamas officials. ""Israel regards UNRWA as part of the problem,"" said Ahron Bregman, an Arab-Israeli relations scholar with the King's College in London. ""With UNRWA support to Palestinian refugees — feeding them, educating them, providing them with health facilities — Hamas is free to fight. ""Bregman told NPR over email that a common grievance among Israeli politicians is that UNRWA regards the children of Palestinian refugees as refugees themselves, which has increased the number of dependents treated by the agency over time. As a former director with the agency pointed out to NPR, that policy is consistent with how other U. N. organizations treat refugees around the world. ""UNRWA is not a political organization,"" Scott Anderson, the then-director for the agency's West Bank operations, said in a 2018 interview with NPR. ""It's part of the social fabric that exists in Gaza. ""NPR's Ruth Sherlock contributed reporting to this story.",npr_articles/article_228.txt,npr_results/article_228.txt.json
229,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/12/1212529494/international-outcry-grows-over-unbearably-desperate-situation-in-gaza-hospitals,"Al-Shifa, the largest hospital in Gaza, has effectively ceased to function and patient deaths there are rising significantly, the head of the World Health Organization said Sunday. Meanwhile, health officials said Gaza's second largest hospital, Al-Quds, was suspending operations from lack of fuel and electricity. Palestinian health officials also said on Sunday that 23 of Gaza's 35 hospitals had stopped working. Israel's military says it's been battling Hamas fighters around Al-Shifa. ""The situation is dire and perilous. It's been 3 days without electricity, without water and with very poor internet which has severely impacted our ability to provide essential care,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a social media post on Sunday. He added that there is ""constant gunfire and bombings in the area"" and that the facility ""is not functioning as a hospital anymore. ""Tedros called for an immediate cease-fire. Earlier, Doctors Without Borders released a voice memo from Dr. Mohammed Obeid from inside Al-Shifa saying the lives of dozens of babies are in peril after their incubators shut down because fuel to power generators ran out. ""We had two neonatal patients die actually because the incubator is not working because there is no electricity,"" Obeid said. ""So the situation is very, very bad. We need help. ""Obeid said the hospital is treating 600 patients and that they are also running out of water and food. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told CNN on Sunday that the goal is to evacuate all the patients from Al-Shifa. He said about 100 patients have been moved so far and special corridors are in place to help civilians travel out of the fighting zone. The prime minister also blamed Hamas for hindering evacuation efforts. ""We're obviously treading carefully when it comes to hospitals but we're also not going to give immunity to the terrorists,"" Netanyahu said on CNN's State of the Union. Later Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press, Netanyahu claimed Israel had offered fuel to the hospital, but it was refused. ""What happens is, the Hamas that is hiding in the hospitals and placing itself there doesn't want the fuel for the hospital,"" the prime minister said. NPR could not immediately verify Netanyahu's claim of Israel helping evacuate patients from the hospital or that it had offered fuel to Al-Shifa. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the U. S. was in ""active consultations"" with the Israeli military over the fighting near hospitals. ""The United States does not want to see firefights in hospitals, where innocent people, patients receiving medical care, are caught in the crossfire,"" he said on CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday. Nine Americans and one green card holder are still unaccounted for since the Hamas incursions, Sullivan said, adding that the U. S. is in close contact with the families of the American hostages. ""We don't know the status – whether they are alive or whether they have passed away – but we are looking to get the safe recovery of all of those individuals,"" he said on CNN's State of the Union. The regional directors of the World Health Organization and United Nations agencies have recorded 137 attacks on health care facilities in Gaza since the fighting began, resulting in 521 people killed and 686 injured. According to the groups, 16 health care workers have been killed and 38 have been injured on duty. ""Decisive international action is needed now to secure an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and prevent further loss of life, and preserve what's left of the health care system in Gaza,"" the groups said Sunday in a joint statement. Robert Mardini, director-general of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said on social media that the ""unbearably desperate"" situation at Al-Shifa Hospital must stop. United Nations humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said there can be ""no justification for acts of war in health care facilities. ""Israel has not allowed any fuel to enter Gaza for more than a month. Israeli officials have confirmed that the military continues to clash with Hamas militants in the vicinity of hospitals in the Gaza Strip, but said Al-Shifa is not under siege. Meanwhile, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said on social media that Gaza City's Al-Quds Hospital is ""out of service and no longer operational"" because of ""the depletion of available fuel and power outage. "" The PRCS, which runs Al-Quds Hospital, said hundreds of patients were trapped and 14,000 people were sheltering there. On Saturday, Israel demanded the evacuation of Gaza hospitals and accused Hamas of using human shields in the facilities. ""The hospitals need to be evacuated so we can deal with Hamas,"" Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for Israel's military, told reporters. Those who do manage to evacuate still face Israeli airstrikes in southern Gaza, where the United Nations says its shelters have only one shower for 700 people. Meanwhile, thousands rallied in Israel Saturday night for the return of about 240 hostages held in Gaza. As fighting continues, Netanyahu said he does not anticipate Israel's military operation to last as long as it had for the U. S. to fight ISIS or al-Qaida. ""It took you many years. I don't think it's going to be many years. But I've set targets and not a deadline,"" he said on Meet the Press. On Saturday, in a televised speech, Netanyahu said there would be no cease-fire until all hostages are released. He also said Israel was forging ahead with his vision for post-war Gaza, which clashes with Washington's ideas. Netanyahu said Gaza will be demilitarized and Israel will maintain security control for the foreseeable future, saying that the Palestinian Authority would have no role there. Washington has tried to discourage Israel from reoccupying Gaza. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the U. S. envisions a Palestinian government in both Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank as a step toward Palestinian statehood, which Netanyahu staunchly opposes. The Palestinian Health Ministry reports more than 11,000 people in Gaza have been killed in Israeli military operations since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people.

231,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/11/1212496317/london-gaza-israel-protest-ceasefire-uk,"LONDON — Hundreds of thousands of people marched in London on Saturday calling for a cease-fire in Gaza, in what was the largest pro-Palestinian rally in the city since the Israel-Hamas conflict began a month ago. London's Metropolitan Police put the number of protesters at over 300,000, while organizers say it could also have been one of the largest protests in British political history, suggesting 800,000 people took part in the march. Saturday's rally came amid a growing political row over British Home Secretary Suella Braverman's suggestion that London's police had been biased in their handling of pro-Palestinian protests and her labeling of the protests as ""hate marches. ""Protesters marched overwhelmingly peacefully through the city, meeting at London's Hyde Park and walking to the U. S. Embassy. The Met police reported ""no issues'' with the protest itself, saying that it had stuck to the prescribed route. The route for Saturday's march, which coincided with Armistice Day, was intentionally drawn up by protest organizers to avoid London's war memorials such as the Cenotaph, where two minutes of silence were held to commemorate the U. K. war dead an hour before the march began. London's police did, however, report incidents of far-right violence in the city, with about 100 counterprotesters arrested. London Mayor Sadiq Khan blamed the far-right violence on the home secretary's language. Scotland's leader Humza Yousaf called for the home secretary to resign, saying the far-right had been ""emboldened"" by her. The Met Police said Saturday evening that they had detained a breakaway group of 150 pro-Palestinian protesters, sometime after the main demonstration had ended. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Saturday evening that he condemned ""the violent scenes we have seen from far-right groups and Hamas sympathizers. All criminality must be met with the full and swift force of the law. ""The pro-Palestinian march drew a diverse crowd, with many families and children taking part. Amanda Cattle, 60, told NPR she thought it was all the more important to march for a cease-fire on Armistice Day. ""My grandfather was a soldier through the whole of the First World War. I always wear a poppy and I always commemorate, but what I really think we should be commemorating is trying to find peace and trying to stop the genocide of the Palestinians which the Israeli government is perpetrating,"" she said. ""It's horrific. ""Protesters made their way from all around the country for the march. According to reports in the British media, the Stop the War Coalition, one of the organizers of Saturday's event, said coach companies across the country reported that all their vehicles were fully booked with waiting lists in some areas. Dorothy Moss, 71, traveled from Leeds, in the north of England, to take part. ""My father was a Jewish refugee, my great uncle was killed in Auschwitz,"" she told NPR. ""What is happening in Israel against the Palestinians is currently at a level of genocide. People of Jewish background should know what genocide is,"" she said. ""We've had experience in our families. It needs to stop, now. "" Israel contends that it is targeting Hamas, not the Palestinian people. Israel's attacks on Gaza have killed more than 11,000 people, according to Gaza health officials. It comes after Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people. Yasmin Hussein has made the two-hour journey from Bedfordshire, in the east of England, every weekend to attend the pro-Palestinian marches in London. ""That's the least we can do for the Palestinian people,"" she told NPR. Hussein was tearful as she explained why she was there. ""I'm here for the people of Palestine, for the children of Palestine, for the innocent people of Palestine. They are human beings, they have not asked for this,"" she said. ""Just stop, please.

232,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/11/1212465136/gaza-hospitals-updates-israel-military-rantisi-shifa,"TEL AVIV, Israel —Israel's military pressed ahead Saturday with a campaign to force the evacuation of hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip so it can pursue Hamas militants it believes are taking cover there. Palestinians said the hospitals, already overwhelmed with patients, are barely functioning, or have suspended services in some cases. ""The hospitals need to be evacuated so we can deal with Hamas,"" said Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman. ""We intend on dealing with Hamas who have turned hospitals into fortified positions. "" The increased pressure from the Israeli military on Gaza's hospitals to evacuate over the past two days has further stressed an overtaxed medical system in the besieged area. Hamas and another Palestinian militant group, Islamic Jihad, have both reported fighting with Israeli forces in areas around the hospitals. Palestinian officials say several Gaza City hospitals, including Al Rantisi Children's Hospital, have been surrounded by Israeli troops. Israel's military said it surrounded Al Rantisi and told everyone to leave, including staff, patients and civilians sheltering on the hospital grounds. The military said Hamas fighters were also present and tried to prevent civilians from leaving. But eventually many civilians left, the military said — many by foot, some by ambulance. Israel's military said it killed the ""terrorist"" who held approximately 1,000 civilians ""hostage"" at Rantisi. With the forced evacuations and ongoing military bombardments from Israel, Gaza's medical system is ""on its knees,"" said World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The WHO's director-general said on Friday that the organization had documented five attacks on five hospitals in a single day in Gaza in the previous week. Half of Gaza's 36 hospitals and two-thirds of the territory's primary health care centers are no longer functioning, he added. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said with the intensified Israeli bombardments around hospitals as of Friday, several facilities were directly hit. On top of this, dwindling fuel remains an acute issue for civilians in Gaza. By Saturday, Al Shifa hospital, the largest such facility in Gaza, had lost power, forcing a shutdown of services requiring electricity, according to Palestinian health officials in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. The Ministry of Health said its intensive care and pediatric departments and the oxygen equipment stopped working. Al Shifa was also the site of an explosion early Friday.  Several videos shared online by witnesses showed people injured in a courtyard that is part of the Al Shifa Complex, which has also served as a shelter for the displaced and injured since the Israeli incursion began. Palestinians blamed Israel for the attack. But Israel said that an errant Palestinian rocket was responsible. Just a week ago, Israel acknowledged an airstrike just outside that hospital killed more than a dozen people. Israel said it targeted Hamas members trying to leave the hospital in an ambulance. The Israeli military maintains it has not directly targeted a hospital, but the health officials in Gaza say the Al Shifa Medical Complex has been hit five times in recent days.

The lives of thousands of civilians, patients and medical staff are at risk,"" said William Schomburg, head of International Committee of the Red Cross' sub-delegation in Gaza.

233,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/11/1212429107/some-veterans-want-a-ceasefire-in-gaza,"Saturday marks Veterans Day in the United States. And while corporations shell out discounts and lawmakers offer their thanks for veterans' service, some veterans say the day is a painful reminder of their own service, especially as war rages in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. ""As I reflect on what's going on today in the Middle East in particular, you know, my goal is to be able to celebrate Veterans Day and not add more to Memorial Day,"" said Dennis Fritz, a retired command chief master sergeant in the Air Force. Fritz now serves as director of the Eisenhower Media Network – an organization of national security experts, including former military and intelligence personnel, that are critical of ""the undue influence that the military-industrial-congressional complex. "" Eisenhower's experts have also argued that NATO's expansion provoked Russia's attack on Ukraine and have called for an end to U. S. military backing for Kiev. The group's primary funder is Ben & Jerry's co-founder and former CEO Ben Cohen. ""I've unfortunately had to send troops off to war, and some of them never came back,"" Fritz said. He, like others NPR interviewed, is critical of the Biden administration and Congress' response to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza. Since last month — when Hamas stormed into Israel and killed some 1,200 people and captured about 240 hostages — Israel has launched a devastating bombing campaign on Gaza that has killed more than 11,000 people. Nearly 1. 5 million more have been displaced. President Biden has repeatedly affirmed his support for Israel's right to exist and defend itself against attacks. But he has also called for Israel to pare back on civilian casualties and allow for some humanitarian aid into Gaza. These pleas, however, have come short of the cease-fire that many, including some veterans, have demanded. ""I'm disappointed in our response in that we have not tried to pull Israel back in their response,"" Fritz said, noting the billions of dollars the United States sends in military aid to Israel each year. ""That's escalating the conflict. And I don't think us sending additional weapons systems out there is helping the matter,"" he said. Ralph Lide, a fellow Air Force veteran, expressed similar concerns. ""One of the things that does concern me is when I see billions of dollars being relegated to foreign countries. And at the same time, we have homeless veterans, and we have veterans walking on the street who need medical care and they are not able to get it. ""On a given night, there are more than 33,000 veterans experiencing homelessness, according to a 2022 report from the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Lide also said that he is concerned that as the war wages on, the United States might be compelled to get further involved militarily — something he does not support. Washington has said it has no plans to have U. S. troops directly involved in the conflict. ""I think war should always be the last resort,"" Lide said. ""And I think there are a lot of people in Congress who've never worn a uniform. They've never had anyone to put their lives on the line for this country. And they should not just cavalierly enter our troops into combat. "" As some veterans have called for a cease-fire in the war, they have met heavy resistance from many lawmakers on Capitol Hill. On Thursday, the White House announced that Israel would allow a four-hour-a-day pause in fighting in order for civilians trapped in northern Gaza to move further south. The daily pause, billed by Israel as a ""humanitarian corridor,"" falls short of the cease-fire that some have sought. Also on Thursday, protesters with the group About Face: Veterans Against the War were arrested at the Capitol calling for a cease-fire. ""Veterans Day weekend is often difficult, oftentimes because it's just filled with platitudes where there is a ritualized, almost religious-type obligation to thank veterans for their service in this country without really inquiring into what that service entailed,"" said Matthew Hoh, a retired Marine Corps captain and State Department officer who is associate director of Eisenhower Media Network. Hoh participated in the U. S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — a role he says he regrets. Watching the violence unfold in Gaza, he said, reminds him of those wars. ""Whether it's the checkpoints, the harassment of people, the humiliation of people by a foreign occupying power, whether it's the kicking in doors, terrorizing families, whether it's the killings of people shot dead by foreign occupation forces, the parallels there between what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan and what the Israelis are doing was clear to me,"" Hoh said. Hoh is now a member of Veterans for Peace and has participated in a half-dozen demonstrations against the war in Gaza. He said the only way forward in the conflict is an immediate cease-fire with the goal of reaching a political, not military, resolution. ""This type of warfare, this type of violence, is only going to be repaid in spades.

234,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/11/1211767117/israel-netanyahu-growing-opposition-hamas-war-gaza,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Noam Tibon was swimming in the Mediterranean Sea on Oct. 7 when he heard sirens, followed by an alarming text message: Hamas militants had infiltrated his son's community in southern Israel. He told his son to lock himself in a safe room. Then Tibon, a retired major general in Israel's army, grabbed his pistol, hopped in his car — and drove south from Tel Aviv, making phone calls along the way. ""I tried the chief of staff, the southern commander and the division commander — I know all of them — but nobody responded to me,"" Tibon, 62, tells NPR. When he finally encountered Israeli soldiers, Tibon asked them to continue south toward the front line with him. ""But their commander said, 'No, I need permission, I need orders,'"" Tibon recalls. ""At that time, I knew: This is chaos. Nobody's giving orders. ""Tibon says he's never been a political man. But he calls what he witnessed that day a ""colossal breakdown"" of the Israeli security apparatus to which he devoted his career. And there's one person he blames. ""Benjamin Netanyahu cannot stay even one more day on the chair of the prime minister,"" Tibon says. ""He is a failure and he must go. ""In Israel, grief and anger are raw after Hamas militants stormed into parts of the country on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, and kidnapping more than 240. In response, the Israeli military has unleashed more than a month of heavy attacks and a total siege on the Gaza Strip, which is ruled by Hamas. Israel's offensive has left more than 11,000 Palestinians dead in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry there. But a growing number of Israelis are blaming their own prime minister for security lapses that may have made the country more vulnerable. A Nov. 3 poll found 76% of Israelis want Netanyahu to resign. On Nov. 7, a leading pro-Netanyahu newspaper reversed its stance and ran an editorial calling for his ouster after the war. Polls taken last month show Netanyahu would lose if elections were held now. In power for most of the past 16 years, Netanyahu has long portrayed himself as tough on security. But critics say he strayed from that focus, and gambled with it. Last year, he invited far-right religious parties to govern with him. Together they have expanded Jewish settlements in the West Bank, alienating the moderate Palestinian Authority, which governs that territory. Meanwhile, Netanyahu was accused of bolstering the more hard-line rule of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, in a risky move to try to drive a wedge between Palestinian leaders in the two noncontiguous territories. And when Netanyahu earlier this year launched a controversial reform of the country's judicial system, weakening the courts and giving himself more control over them, it divided Israelis and prompted massive street protests. To Tibon, it was all a diversion from Israel's own security. Since Oct. 7, divisions among Israelis over Netanyahu's policies have now given way to greater unity — against the prime minister. On Nov. 2, a municipal official from Netanyahu's Likud Party in the country's south, where the Hamas attacks happened, resigned from the party on live TV. ""I place the blame on the Israeli government. I call here on all my friends, members of the Likud Central Committee, to take a similar step, in view of this incredible failure,"" said Tamir Idan, head of the Sdot Negev Regional Council, waving his resignation letter. Israel's defense minister, the military chief of staff and the head of the country's domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet have all said they personally accept responsibility for security lapses. Netanyahu admits mistakes were made. He told ABC News on Monday: ""The responsibility of a government is to protect the people and clearly that responsibility wasn't met. ""But in a now-deleted social media post, he blamed defense and intelligence officials for giving him faulty assessments. The prime minister says there will be an investigation — and that he's happy to answer questions himself — but only after the war is over. At news conferences, he's nevertheless been asked repeatedly about whether he plans to resign. ""The only thing that I intend to have resign is Hamas,"" Netanyahu told an Oct. 30 gathering of foreign reporters. ""We're going to resign them to the dustbin of history. ""One of the slogans from protests earlier this year over Netanyahu's judicial reforms — ""Lech ha bayta,"" meaning ""Get out"" in Hebrew — has been repurposed at fresh demonstrations in recent days. Protesters have gathered outside the Israeli legislature and at Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem. Netanyahu's supporters say these are the same left-wing critics who led previous rallies against the prime minister's judicial reforms. And they say the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks were not the prime minister's fault. But the latest protests have been bolstered by participation by some of the families of the more than 240 hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. At a recent rally in Tel Aviv, Tsipi Haitovsky, the neighbor of a family with several members among the hostages, told NPR she wants Netanyahu to resign immediately. But she says the hostage families are divided. Privately, they're criticizing Netanyahu, Haitovsky says. But many have been hesitant to raise their voices. Even some of Netanyahu's fiercest critics say war is not the time for political recriminations. ""There's this kind of belief that in the middle of war, you can't change the leadership,"" Haitovsky says. Netanyahu is banking on Israelis not wanting to change leaders during a war, says Mazal Mualem, an Israeli political analyst and the author of a biography called Cracking the Netanyahu Code. Mualem says Netanyahu is pragmatic — a realist. He believes he's got a window of opportunity to salvage his legacy while the war is underway, she says. Because he knows his premiership is unlikely to survive beyond that. But Netanyahu is also a fighter. ""And the more demonized he feels, the harder he fights,"" Mualem says. Tibon, the army veteran who raced south on Oct. 7, took security into his own hands that day. He told NPR he drove past bodies and burned-out cars along the road. At one point, a young couple emerged from the bushes, having escaped a Hamas attack on a rave party in the desert. He gave them a lift. At another, Tibon says he engaged militants in a gun battle himself. He fought his way to his son's house, in a kibbutz near the Gaza border. ""When I got there, I knocked on the window and said, 'Dad is here. ' And my little granddaughter, 3 1/2 years old, said 'Grandpa came!'"" Tibon recalls. ""And you know, that was the greatest moment of my life. ""Locked in their basement, his family survived the Hamas attacks that day. But Tibon says an immediate change of Israeli leadership is the only way to ensure no other family goes through what he did.

235,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/11/1211769259/israel-hamas-gaza-jerusalem-shops-war,"JERUSALEM — The Old City of Jerusalem is thousands of years old. People from all over the world travel here to see the expansive history and the foundation of religions and empires — until now. Today, walking around the Old City feels like a ghost town. In the Jewish Quarter, your voice echoes off the stone-covered paths and shut businesses. And it's having a very real impact. According to Israel's tourism minister, before the war began between Israel and Hamas, about 15,000 tourists a day entered Israel. On Oct. 30, there were just 26 tourists for the entire country. Many restaurants and shops depend on the constant stream of tourists for their livelihood – and the war has hit Jerusalem's economy hard. Walking around the Old City and speaking to shopkeepers provides an insight into how it's affecting the locals. Mihran Krikorian unlocks his small, stylish wine bar to reveal more than a dozen tables and chairs stacked up against the walls. He has permits to have 16 tables outside and four inside, but he hasn't bothered to put out more than a few lately. Krikorian's restaurant is on what is normally a bustling street in the Armenian Quarter of the Old City. ""It's a lot of money to run the place. And if this is the situation [and] it's going to stay, then we will start losing a lot monthly,"" he says. ""So that is why we're rethinking, we're trying to talk with the owner of the [space] so that maybe we can come to an agreement about the rent and everything, you know, until things get back on our feet. He's a good guy. ""Krikorian is a third-generation Armenian living in Jerusalem. His grandparents fled here during the massacre of Armenians during the 1910s. He says his restaurant is loved for its Armenian food. He wants it to be known as the go-to spot for Armenian wine as well – and he had just begun to import it as the war began, but stopped because he couldn't afford it. Krikorian says the financial struggles are widespread, and that many of his friends are out of jobs right now. But the emotional weight of the conflict is a separate burden to bear. His wife is Palestinian and has family in Gaza. ""So everyone is kind of uneasy and depressed,"" he says. ""At least we still have a home to go to. You know, it's very hard. ""Café Bajjali & Ko is a Palestinian-Korean fusion restaurant in the Christian Quarter of the Old City. Natalie Bajjali named the restaurant after her father and mother's surnames. As a Palestinian-Korean woman, she wanted to share the food she grew up enjoying. And for the three months she's been open – she did. But Bajjali shut her doors after the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7 over safety concerns and hasn't reopened since. ""In the past, if any situation does happen in Jerusalem or in the country, the first place to strike is probably the Old City,"" she says. ""As you see walking through the city, there's not many people, there's not much traffic, people are scared to come down. ""Her restaurant is close to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which is typically a popular pilgrimage site for Christians. Earlier this week, there were only a few people walking around inside the basilica, and the surrounding area was mostly empty. This restaurant space has been in Bajjali's family since the 1920s, but she is not sure when – or if – she'll reopen. ""I'm just thankful for being safe being here,"" she says. ""Priorities have changed – my priorities are not my business anymore, in a sense. My mind is elsewhere. ""Itay Levy's shop is one of the only businesses open on Jewish Quarter Street. His windows are lined with small wooden harps that he handcrafts out of cypress wood. ""This is called Kinnor. It is a Jewish instrument that King David played,"" Levy says, holding the instrument. ""It's like a little harp – eight-string harp. ""He has also only been open for three months. Since the war, he says business has nearly come to a standstill. The sign for the name of his store is in Hebrew, and when asked what it means, he translates: ""The Work of Peace. """"We are in a war,"" he says. Levy is Jewish, and says he didn't have words to describe the emotional toll the Oct. 7 attacks have had on him. ""Each day, I deal with it . . . every day is like a new adventure. ""According to Jerusalem locals, Hummus Lina is the best hummus spot in the city. It's a hole-in-the-wall kind of eatery, typically mobbed by all types of people this time of day. It's owned by Ghaleb Abdulfatah Zahdy, who is standing behind a small counter smashing a fresh batch of chickpeas in a big bowl. ""The recipe I have is the one I learned from my father,"" Zahdy tells us in Arabic. This used to be his father's shop before he took over. It's been open for 35 years. He says he identifies first as Muslim, then as Arab, then as Palestinian. ""All types of people are welcome here,"" he says, before adding that there has been almost no business in the last month. Today, there is just one customer sitting in the shop, who Zahdy says knew his father too. Even though no one is stopping by, he says he stays open to get out of the house and pass the time. He says it's costing him money just to run the water and electricity. ""In the past four weeks, I've had very few customers . . . very few Jewish customers. People are just afraid,"" he says. ""Thank the lord I'm doing fine, but all of this that's going on around me is very disturbing. It hurts to see that happen, but I'm alright.

236,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/11/1211234951/colleges-face-pressure-to-curb-antisemitism-and-islamophobia,"It didn't take long after the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre in Israel for demonstrations on U. S. campuses that began as vigils to devolve into vitriol and violence. At Cornell University, a student was arrested for allegedly threatening to slit Jews' throats. At Drexel University, a Jewish student's dorm room door was set on fire. At the Cooper Union in New York, pro-Palestinian demonstrators banged on windows and doors of a library where Jewish students were holed up inside. And at Tulane University, protesters assaulted a Jewish student, breaking his nose. ""There was blood pouring down my nose. It was all over the sidewalk,"" recalls freshman Dylan Mann, who says he is still recuperating, physically and mentally. ""It was scary,"" he adds. ""And I think what we're seeing right now is a lot of shouting at each other. And at the end of the day, it's not going to change anyone's mind. It's just going to add fuel to the fire. ""Hard numbers for incidents specifically on campuses are hard to come by, but overall, the Anti-Defamation League says the number of verified antisemitic incidents across the U. S. in the first two weeks following Oct. 7 are nearly quadruple what they were at the same time last year. ""Things have intensified in ways we have never seen before,"" says Jonathan Greenblatt, the organization's CEO. ""We're talking about assaults, vandalism, harassment, bullying, and a dizzying array of activities. ""Pro-Palestinian students complain they're also being targeted. Many have been harassed, and doxxed, and have lost jobs because of it. Some have also suffered physical assaults, including a Stanford student who was hospitalized after a hit-and-run on campus that's now being investigated as a hate crime. Here, too, concrete numbers for campus incidents are difficult to pin down. But the wave of attacks and intimidation was enough for the Biden administration this week to inform colleges they must unequivocally condemn antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents on campus, and take aggressive action to curb it. If they don't, officials warn, they could lose federal funding.  ""The universities, generally, are failing the test. I would give the vast majority of university administrators an F,"" Greenblatt says, noting not only schools' sluggishness in condemning the October 7th Hamas attacks, but also in addressing students' security concerns in the days following. Greenblatt says when it comes to antisemitism, colleges have traditionally had something of a blind spot, treating anti-Jewish hate differently than anti-LGBTQ hate, for example, or racism.  ""Universities for far too long have been permissive about [antisemitic] actions they would never countenance if directed at any other community, Greenblatt says. ""I'm talking about hateful speakers who come to campus and incite anti-Semitism and bigotry against Jewish students. I'm talking about classes that regularly slander and delegitimize Jews and Israel. It creates the conditions in which crazy people feel impelled to take action. And I worry it could get worse. ""Schools across the nation have now begun beefing up security and setting up task forces to deal with antisemitism. At the University of Pennsylvania, for example, where there have been many incidents of antisemitic harassment, vandalism, and threatening emails that are now being investigated by the FBI, the university concedes it ""has work to do"" to root what it calls the ""evil"" of antisemitism. But to many, it's not enough. Some Jewish students are withdrawing applications from certain schools.  Many donors — Jewish and non-Jewish — are pulling their giving, or threatening to, if universities don't do more to condemn – and curb – antisemitism. And a Jewish high school in New Jersey has told colleges they can't come recruit there unless they prove they've got a solid campus safety plan to protect Jewish students. ""We can't send students to a situation where they cannot be safe,"" says Rabbi Joshua Kahn, Head of School at Torah Academy of Bergen County. ""This has to be dealt with urgently. Every single student on a college campus should feel safe. "" Even on relatively calm campuses, Jewish students say they're rattled by acts like the destruction of pictures of Israeli hostages. ""Seeing the posters ripped down on my walk to class can really just clog my brain for the day, and make it hard to focus,"" says University of Michigan student Emma Jonas. What is equally upsetting, she says, is that so many colleges are failing to make this a teachable moment. Students are uninformed, Jonas says, as she saw recently at a campus demonstration where pictures of young children being held hostage were taped to baby strollers. A student came by and was shocked to learn that such young children and babies were among the hostages, Jonas says. ""This has been going on for three weeks. And for someone's first encounter with it to be [that day], I was totally shocked,"" Jonas says. ""I do believe this is very much driven by ignorance,"" says Maria Ayoub, a Palestinian student at the University of Maryland, College Park.  She was among several others who recently had an encounter with a group of pro-Israel students on campus. ""We heard some Palestinians yelling at them, telling them to kill themselves 'and just to get out, you're not welcome' and all these things,"" Ayoub recalls. But what could have gone really bad, actually went the other way. ""We were like 'That's not okay, you can't say that to anybody,'"" Ayoub says. ""So we did apologize [to the pro-Israel students] on that person's behalf. ""Two hours later, the pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli students were still talking, — about the suffering on both sides, for example, and what certain slogans like ""From the river to the sea"" do and don't mean to them. Aleena Hassen-Friess, one of the pro-Palestinian students there, says she also heard things she never had before, like the fact that the Israeli military dropped leaflets warning people in northern Gaza to evacuate to evade upcoming strikes. Keren Binyamin, a Jewish student, says it was just the first clue of their vastly different realities. For example, while Binyamin and her friends believe  official Israeli reports that women were raped by Hamas, she was stunned to learn that some pro-Palestinian students believe that didn't happen. ""I was beyond shocked at the disparities in our information,"" says Binyamin.  ""We were just operating in such different bases of fact. ""As the students spoke, passers-by stared and snapped pictures of the students in kippahs talking to those wearing keffiyehs. Before it was all over, Ayoub and Binyamin even shared a laugh. ""She said that me and her looked very similar, like we could practically be sisters,"" Ayoub recalls. ""She looked a lot like me, we had the same eyes and hair,"" says Binyamin, who is of Iranian descent. ""We stood next to each other like 'Look, isn't this so funny,' and there was a chuckle. """"It definitely made us laugh,"" says Ayoub. Before leaving, the two shook hands and traded phone numbers. But those kinds of encounters are more the exception than the rule. Things didn't go nearly as well, when Morgan Marietta, a professor at the University of Texas, Arlington, organized a Q&A for students with the school's resident Middle East expert. Pro-Palestinian students balked, insisting the single expert would be one-sided and unfair. Students protested outside, Marietta says, and disrupted the event from within, shouting questions like ""What's the difference between Zionists and Nazis?"" and ""Why don't you care about Palestinians?""""These were not questions seeking actual information or discussion. They were assaults,"" Marietta says. And things went downhill from there. ""There was a student shouting, 'F*** all of you, f*** Israel, f*** the United States!' "" Marrietta says. ""How she thought that would persuade anyone that she was taking a reasonable position is beyond me. Universities have failed these students, deeply failed them. ""Marietta says schools could begin to correct the problem with a mandatory training during freshman orientation on how to have a robust — but respectful, and intellectually honest — academic debate. But for his efforts, Marietta ended up rebuked by the university, and he resigned from his job as department chair, rather than comply with new restrictions imposed by the university on any future events. In his resignation letter, Marietta called the new policies ""transparent attempts to [. . . ] curtail the academic freedom of scholars"" and he wrote that ""universities must not cower away from the truth in order to pacify protesters. ""The University of Texas, Arlington, through a spokesperson, declined to comment. To many, it's simply too soon for calm conversation. An Arab-American student leader at the University of Maryland says he is skeptical that the kind of empathetic conversation that happened on the College Park campus could happen more broadly right now. ""It's hard to have these conversations,"" he says. Personally, he's ""willing to converse with Jewish students, but I will say that generally, the person has to have a level of understanding of our position,"" and ""cannot be coming at us with the idea that Palestinians are all terrorists. I refuse to have conversations with people who harbor those beliefs. ""The student asked that his name not be used, noting the many pro-Palestinian students who are getting harassed and doxxed. ""I don't want to have to face backlash, especially when it's often blatant smearing and libel, because of employers not wanting to hire someone who is allegedly antisemitic or allegedly a terrorist sympathizer. ""As this student and many others see it, universities are leaning too pro-Israel, and are not doing enough to prevent harassment of pro-Palestinian students. Patty Perillo, University of Maryland vice president of student affairs, says official statements since Oct. 7 were vetted by both the rabbi and imam on campus. ""They helped us consider different words and they helped us consider a different statement,"" she says. But she concedes, ""you just know that you're not always going to win. "" Some blowback is inevitable, she adds, from one side, the other, or both. ""It's tough. There's no doubt about it, you can get slammed either way. ""Some schools are taking a cue from the Kalven Report, a 1967 University of Chicago paper that implores universities to stay neutral on political and social issues. Schools should be the home — and sponsor — of critics, the case goes, not the critics themselves. But Perillo calls that untenable.  ""You can't stand in neutrality,"" she says. ""We're an institution that says we're deeply invested in inclusive community. You can't say that and then stand on the sidelines. ""Kaiser Aslam, the Muslim chaplain at Rutgers University-New Brunswick, agrees that schools need to play a role. His campus has a large population of Muslims and Jews, and he says when emotions run high, it's not the time to run away; rather, he says, that can be the most teachable moment. ""Meaning, in that moment in which we feel very sensitive and raw, oftentimes that's where, if there was some inert Islamophobia or anti-semitism, those come to the surface,"" Aslam says. ""And that's a great opportune moment to correct it rather than to try to ignore it or excuse it. """,npr_articles/article_236.txt,npr_results/article_236.txt.json
237,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/11/1212326333/proportionality-israel-gaza-war-war-crimes,"Israel is coming under mounting criticism for its actions in Gaza where more than 11,000 people have been killed, according to Palestinian officials, the vast majority of them civilians. This follows Hamas' attack on Israel last month that killed around 1,200 people. Targeting civilians is a war crime. But what if there are civilians in or near a legitimate military target? This is where something in the laws of war called ""proportionality"" comes into play. As in, the military advantage must be proportionate to the loss of civilian life. In such a case, the U. S. military uses what's called a ""collateral damage estimate,"" or CDE, which determines how many civilians would be killed or wounded when a military target is hit, says Michel Paradis, a human rights lawyer who teaches at Columbia Law School. And then you get into how valuable is the target. If it's a member of al-Qaida plotting the next attack, the calculus may include the possible collateral death of one or two civilians, but if the target, for instance, is Osama bin Laden, then a higher number of likely civilian deaths may be considered acceptable. The numbers are generated by military and civilian officials and are classified. And a decision to strike that target could go up the chain of command, depending on the number of casualties. ""This is an oversimplification,"" said Paradis, ""but for example if the CDE is 1, then a lieutenant can order the strike. If it is 10, it must go to a major, is 100 it must go to a colonel, and if 1,000 it must go to a general. All along the way, you also have military lawyers consulting in the process in the hopes of keeping you honest. """"Who decides proportionality?"" asks Aaron O'Connell, a retired Marine colonel who teaches at the University of Texas. He presented this scenario: ""It is a reasonable person standard, and the standard is this: As long as the violence is intended for a legitimate military target, like a Hamas command center under the al-Shifa hospital, collateral damage is acceptable. Whether 20, 200 or 2,000 noncombatants get killed is the question the hypothetical person has to answer to make a judgment on whether war crimes occurred. A pretty loose standard. ""Israeli officials have said they will take steps to limit civilian casualties, but it fell to a Pentagon official, Dana Stroul, to provide more detail during a hearing on Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the Israeli-Gaza war. ""They have dropped 1. 5 million leaflets in Gaza asking civilians to evacuate,"" Stroul said. ""They have sent over hundreds of thousands of text messages and made phone calls to cell phones. . . . In our conversations with the Israel Defense Forces they have made clear they assess collateral damage estimates before they take strikes. ""Israel is known to do a lot more in the way of precautionary measures, says Paradis, the human rights lawyer; this has not always been consistent. ""The most famous of these is 'roof knocking,' in which they drop a small but loud explosive onto the roof of a building that is going to be the target of a strike,"" he said. ""They wait 15 minutes to an hour to let people evacuate, and then they conduct the strike. ""But the attacks two weeks ago against a suspected Hamas leader inside a tunnel next to the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza raised questions about proportionality and led to accusations of war crimes being committed by Israel. Some 50 civilians were killed in the attack. ""Given the high number of civilian casualties [and] the scale of destruction following Israeli air strikes on the Jabalia refugee camp we have serious concerns that these are disproportionate attacks that could amount to war crimes,"" the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement. Indeed, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken urged Israel to do more to protect civilians. Speaking to reporters in New Delhi, Blinken said, ""Far too many Palestinians have been killed. Far too many have suffered these past weeks. And we want to do everything possible to prevent harm to them and to maximize the assistance that gets to them. ""The issue of proportionality ""is pretty subjective,"" said a retired senior military officer who served in the Middle East and requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the topic. ""The attacker makes the determination, but ultimately public opinion will decide. Israel will probably do what it believes it must to win while trying to mitigate the domestic and international consequences by using as much precision as they deem appropriate.

238,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/11/1212458974/israel-revises-death-toll-hamas-attacks-oct-7,"TEL AVIV, Israel — In a text message to journalists on Friday, a spokesperson from Israel's Foreign Ministry said ""around 1,200"" is now what he called ""the official number of people"" killed by Hamas militants on Oct. 7. That's about 200 fewer victims than Israel had been citing for more than a month. ""This is not a final number. It is an updated estimate,"" Lior Haiat, spokesperson for the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, wrote. He added that the toll might still change again. Israeli media quote unnamed officials as saying some remains were initially misidentified. Many of the bodies were burned and mutilated that day, and the process of identifying them is still underway. The number of hostages being held in Gaza remains at around 240.

239,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/11/10/1211672951/israel-hamas-war-mental-health-gaza-children,"When Iman Farajallah was growing up in Gaza, she says she witnessed the first and second intifadas — Palestinian uprisings against Israel's occupation of Gaza and the West Bank — and subsequent wars with Israel. ""The experience was so vicious, so scary, so harmful that there are no words that you can actually describe it,"" says Farajallah, a psychologist who now lives in the United States and works with refugee children at a community clinic in San Francisco. ""How can you describe when [an] Israeli soldier comes and jumps from the walls into our home, beating up my brothers, beating up my mother?"" Yet, as a child, she says, she wasn't able to talk to anyone about how terrifying those experiences were. ""Nobody ever talked to me about my trauma,"" she says.  Now there is new trauma for children in Gaza. The current conflict began on Oct 7, when Hamas attacked parts of Israel, killing 1,400 people and kidnapping more than 200, including 32 children. In response, Israel began bombing Gaza and launched a ground invasion. The children in Gaza, including the hostages, are trapped in a war zone. According to Palestinian health officials, of the more than 10,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza in the past month, about 4,000 were children. Gaza is becoming a ""graveyard for children,"" U. N. Secretary-General António Guterres said on Monday. And even as the World Health Organization warns about the spread of infectious diseases in Gaza, some researchers are concerned that those children who do survive might be scarred for the rest of their lives. Researchers say the cumulative trauma of chronic ethnic-political violence has a profound and lasting impact on children's mental health and development, affecting their functioning and outlook on the world as young adults. Studies show that even youth who seem to become desensitized to the violence around them remain deeply scarred — unless, that is, they are given a chance to recover. This is especially a concern for children in Gaza, who were already struggling with significant mental health issues well before this conflict. For years, numerous studies have documented unusually high rates of mental and behavioral health issues among Gaza's youth, who make up nearly half of the population in the territory. Most of them have never known a life without the threat of violence and conflict. In recent years, Farajallah returned to Gaza to talk to kids and their families, and document how violence has affected their physical and mental health. Many children struggle with symptoms of physical trauma, says Farajallah. ""A lot of them have been impacted by the bombs,"" she says. ""So they have scars. They have splinters and fragments in their body. Some of them [have] lost their limbs, some of them have lost their eyesight. ""She also saw a whole range of mental and behavioral health symptoms among children in Gaza, like ""fear of darkness, general tension, flashback, nightmares, avoidance, difficulty sleeping and a recollection of their trauma. "" Many other studies have documented high levels of emotional distress and mental illness among children in Gaza and the West Bank. A review study in 2011 found high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder among Palestinian children, with estimates in various studies ranging from 23% to 70%.  According to UNICEF, before the previous conflict in 2021, one in three children in Gaza needed care for conflict-related trauma. In a study in 2022, the nonprofit Save the Children interviewed nearly 500 children and 160 parents in Gaza. It found that 80% of children in the study showed symptoms of emotional distress. About half of them there reported having contemplated suicide, and three out of five kids were self-harming. Four in five children reported they were living with depression, grief and fear. A series of international studies following both Israeli and Palestinian children over several years have documented how exposure to high levels of ethnic and political violence not only hurts children's mental health but also makes it more likely for some to become aggressive toward others. Back in 2007, a team of American, Israeli and Palestinian researchers began following hundreds of children in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza to understand how much political and ethnic violence they were exposed to and how that was affecting them in the long run. ""We were able to look at exposure to violence from middle childhood, around age 8, all the way through late adolescence, emerging adulthood,"" says Eric Dubow, professor of psychology at Bowling Green State University. They looked at a range of exposures to political and military violence, from having family members or friends and acquaintances die to seeing someone held hostage, tortured or abused to witnessing the destruction of buildings, buses or properties.  While both Israeli and Palestinian children were exposed to relatively high levels of violence, Dubow says Palestinian children's exposure was significantly greater than for Israeli children on all measures they looked at. For example, they found that 55% of Palestinian children reported having at least one friend or acquaintance die due to political or military violence. In comparison, 13% of Israeli Jewish kids and only 3% of Israeli Arab kids had the same experience. While 43% of Palestinian children had witnessed someone being held hostage or tortured or abused by Israelis, 14% of Israeli Jewish kids said they had witnessed such violence by the other side. ""There's no question that the Palestinian kids are being exposed to a lot more political violence than the Israeli kids,"" says Dubow. Dubow and his colleagues found that high levels of ethnic-political violence also increased the levels of violence in communities, and perhaps more important for kids, within families. ""When families are growing up in these conflict zones, it affects the parents,"" says Dubow. ""The parents become more depressed, the parents become more aggressive toward each other. ""So children in a conflict zone are more likely to experience violence at home and more likely to be harshly treated by their parents, he says. His team found that overall  exposure to violence affects both Israeli and Palestinian kids in a number of harmful ways. ""The more violence they see all around them in their broader social environment, the more likely they are to have higher levels of post-traumatic stress (PTS) reactions,"" says Dubow's colleague Paul Boxer at Rutgers University. As the team reported in a 2013 study, the Palestinian children had the highest levels of PTS symptoms, followed by Israeli Jewish kids and then, Israeli Arab kids. And these symptoms stayed with the kids through the seven years of the study, following the oldest cohort into adulthood. Post-traumatic stress is debilitating for youth, says Dubow. ""Their sense of the world is shattered,"" he says. ""They don't feel secure in their families. They don't feel secure in their relationships with others. They're constantly on guard. "" Dubow, Boxer and their team also found that greater exposure to ethnic-political violence was associated with more aggressive behaviors among children in all age groups they looked at. The aggression starts out as ""pushing and shoving other kids,"" says Dubow, ""but by the time they're [in] adolescence and late adolescence and even into early adulthood, then we start to see more severe physical aggression and we also start to see more support for violent political demonstrations. "" By the seventh year of the study, when the oldest kids were young adults, nearly 22% of Palestinian youth and 15% of Israeli youth said they had participated in at least one violent political protest in the past year. He and his colleagues also wanted to know how these children who were seeing so much violence around them from a young age were reacting to violence. So they did an experiment and showed the kids a violent video to gauge their emotional reaction. ""We actually hooked kids to this machine that basically has little straps that go around the fingers and measures the amount of sweat under the skin,"" says Dubow. The amount of sweat is an indicator of emotional arousal – the more someone sweats, the stronger their feelings. As the researchers reported in a study this year, one group of kids got sweaty and anxious after watching the video. ""Those kids actually show more post-traumatic stress symptoms because they are emotionally aroused by the violence,"" says Dubow. But the other kids weren't aroused by the violence in the video – they were numb to it.  And these are the kids, Dubow says, who had become aggressive toward others and were more likely to participate in violent political protests as young adults. ""Most of us, when we're exposed to violence, it's abhorrent to us,"" says Dubow. ""We reject it. We think it's horrible. "" But when children are constantly exposed to violence from a young age, some start to become desensitized to it. ""By becoming numb to the violence we see, it makes it a lot easier to accept violence as a typical way of responding to a social situation,"" he adds.  These kids start to believe ""that the world is a more violent place, that aggression is a good way to solve problems,"" says Boxer, ""and [that] the world in the broader sense, is a very hostile environment where there may be others who are consistently out to get them. "" For all the outcomes Boxer and his colleagues looked at, Palestinian children fared worse than Israeli kids. The ongoing conflict, he says, only makes things worse. Both children in Gaza and the Israeli children directly exposed to the Hamas attacks are now at a greater risk of long-term post-traumatic stress and other mental health problems, says Dubow. ""It's almost unfathomable to think about what's happening to kids there,"" says Boxer. What kids in Gaza need most urgently, he says, is to be safe. It's part of what's known as ""psychological first aid,"" he says. ""So making sure kids are warm and clothed and fed, kept physically safe. ""Only then, he says, can they receive care to minimize the long-term mental health impacts of what they have been through in recent weeks. But Iman Farajallah, the Palestinian-American psychologist, says mental health care alone can't heal children in Gaza. ""When you work with a child, he's going to ask you, 'but what if another war broke out? Can you protect me? Can you protect my parents?' "" she says. ""Our answer is 'no, we can't. ' "" With violence spiraling in the war, she fears that the children in Gaza won't have a real chance to recover from their trauma.

240,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/10/1212073968/israel-gaza-hamas-war-crimes-hospitals,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Is a hospital ever a legitimate military target?Israeli troops have surrounded and forcibly evacuated hospitals in Gaza, which have also suffered repeated damage in the Israel-Hamas war. The protected status of these hospitals is a source of fierce disagreement between Israelis and Palestinians. Palestinians say that hospitals should never be harmed. ""Hospitals have specific protections under international law and there should be the utmost care to protect those facilities,"" said Wesam Ahmad, with the Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq, which is based in the West Bank. Israel's military counters by saying that Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, operates in tunnels beneath Gaza's hospitals in hopes this will spare the militant group from Israeli attack. ""Hamas is cynically using hospitals as a shield for its underground terror complex,"" said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Israel's chief military spokesperson. Israel raises this issue almost daily, and argues that these Hamas actions can override the legal safeguards normally provided hospitals. This is all part of the larger debate over civilian casualties. More than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza since fighting began Oct. 7, mostly civilians, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. Most of the 1,200 dead in Israel from the Oct. 7 Hamas attack were also civilians, according to Israeli officials. Israel argues it's pursuing Hamas and can't avoid civilian casualties because Hamas embeds itself in Gaza's most populated neighborhoods. For Hamas, this is a ""win-win strategy,"" said Pnina Sharvit Baruch, a lawyer who served in Israel's army as a top legal adviser on military operations. ""Either Israel refrains from attacking this [Hamas] military infrastructure because civilians might get killed. Or Israel does attack. Civilians get killed and the whole world puts pressure on Israel,"" said Sharvit Baruch, now with the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. But Sari Bashi, the head of global research at Human Rights Watch, said Israel is unleashing massive firepower — and knows the outcome. ""The Israeli military has been launching explosive weapons in densely crowded city blocks, causing tremendous civilian harm. That's predictable,"" Bashi said. So what exactly do the laws of war say about hospitals?The Geneva Conventions of 1949 provide special protection, saying ""civilian hospitals . . . may in no circumstances be the object of attack but shall at all times be respected and protected by the parties to the conflict. ""However, this shield is not absolute. The Geneva Conventions go on to say that a hospital can lose this protected status if an armed group uses the hospital to carry out ""acts harmful to the enemy. ""Legal scholars say a Hamas attack from a hospital could make it a military target, though not immediately. The Geneva Conventions add that the opposing side, in this case Israel, must give the hospital ""due warning"" and allow a ""reasonable time limit"" to see if the attacks stop. And any retaliation must be proportionate. A lone gunman firing from a hospital wouldn't give an army the right to destroy the entire building and harm large numbers of civilians, according to lawyers. ""I am particularly worried about the risk of indiscriminate attacks because of the way the Israeli military is waging this war,"" said Bashi of Human Rights Watch. The former Israeli military lawyer, Sharvit Baruch, spent years working with Israeli commanders as they compiled target lists during times of relative calm. She said she could veto planned attacks as legally problematic, though commanders could appeal up the chain of command. She acknowledged that when fighting erupts, there simply isn't time to review every attack. And she also noted there are times when Israel might act within the letter of the law, yet harms itself in the court of international public opinion. ""You see the devastation in Gaza, the heart breaks,"" she said. ""There's immediately a sense that Israel is using too much force, this can't be legal. ""Palestinian officials in Gaza say more than 100 health care facilities have been damaged in Israeli attacks and more than 40 ambulances destroyed over the past month. Two attacks have received widespread attention. The first was an Oct. 17 explosion in the parking lot of the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City. Palestinians said several hundreds were killed and blamed an Israeli airstrike. Israel denied involvement, saying the cause was an errant rocket fired by Palestinian militants. U. S. and other intelligence agencies also investigated, and said the evidence pointed to a Palestinian rocket. The second episode was Nov. 3, when Israel acknowledged an airstrike just outside Shifa Hospital, the largest hospital the Gaza Strip. Israel said it targeted an ambulance that Hamas fighters were using as cover to get away from the hospital in Gaza City. Hamas denied this, while hospital officials said bystanders accounted for many of the 13 killed and dozens injured. At least some of the casualties were among the thousands of Palestinians who are camping out on the grounds of Shifa and other hospitals, hoping they will provide at least a bit more safety than other places in Gaza, a territory under almost round-the-clock bombardment. Sari Bashi said Human Rights Watch is investigating this attack on Shifa hospital, noting Israel said the Hamas fighters were leaving the hospital, not attacking from it. She also said that Israel gave no warning it was striking. ""These are the kinds of rules that all the nations in the world have agreed to,"" she said. ""And even on its own statements, the Israeli military is not accepting those rules. ""The same rules of war apply to Hamas, which makes no pretense of observing them. A 1977 addition to the international rules of warfare state that ""under no circumstances shall medical units be used in an attempt to shield military objectives from attack. ""Hamas denies the Israeli allegation that it has headquarters under Shifa Hospital. But the militant group does acknowledge building a vast tunnel network, and it is widely believed to be operating underground in and around sensitive civilian sites. In addition, Hamas has always targeted Israeli civilians, from scores of suicide bombings in the 1990s and early 2000s, to its Oct. 7 massacre in southern Israel. The group holds about 240 hostages, most of them civilians, and during the past month, has fired thousands of rockets in ongoing attacks directed at civilians in Israeli cities. Sharvit Baruch put it this way: ""How can we eliminate the threat of Hamas and spare civilians in the Gaza Strip?""Neither Israel nor its critics, she said, has a good answer.

241,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/10/1211687030/the-death-of-a-palestinian-olive-farmer-emphasizes-conflict-over-land,"The Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 killed some 1,400 people, according to Israeli authorities. Palestinian authorities maintain that the Israeli response has killed more than 10,000. So it's reasonable to ask why the death of a single olive farmer has captured such attention. Numerous news outlets, including NPR, covered the killing of Bilal Saleh outside his village last month. Human rights groups and think tanks have highlighted the case. The episode represents a microcosm of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Though that conflict reflects many divides — over identity, security, faith, nationalism, and history, to name a few — it's commonly expressed as a struggle over land. Saleh lived with his family on the West Bank, a region occupied by Israel since a 1967 war. It's home to millions of Palestinians, and has been projected as territory for a future Palestinian state. But Israeli settlers have claimed large parts of it for decades, building fenced or walled communities that are connected to Israel proper by their own limited-access highways. The U. S. and United Nations have branded the settlements illegal. Israelis refer to the region as Judea and Samaria, biblical names that represent their claim to it. Saleh's home was in As-Sawiya, a village on a ridgeline overlooking a valley filled with olive trees. An Israeli settlement called Rehelim stood on the opposite side of the valley, encroaching on what As-Sawiya residents regard as their land. Saleh took part when he, his family and many of his neighbors descended into the valley for the annual olive harvest. Saleh's brother-in-law, Hazem Saleh, described the harvest as more than agriculture. It was like a ""festival. "" Whole families bring ladders to the fields. ""We take food. We take kids,"" he told Morning Edition. Residents of the village knew they were also taking a risk when they harvested on October 28. They had strained relations with Rehelim across the way, and knew a war was underway. But they went ahead. They were on wooden ladders picking olives when Israeli settlers approached. The Palestinians say they decided to retreat, and then Bilal Saleh realized he had left behind his cell phone. His family last saw him going through the trees to get it. He was out of sight in the trees when his wife heard him shout, and at least two gunshots sounded. His friends and relatives later found him with wounds to the chest and arm. Lacking first aid supplies, they used a ladder as an improvised stretcher to carry him uphill to the nearest road. He died in the presence of his wife and children. His wife, Ikhlas, used an Arabic saying to explain her thoughts when she realized he was dead: ""My back was broken. ""When we spoke with her on Oct. 31, a man was in custody for the crime. The Israel Defense Forces arrested an off-duty soldier. Israeli military law is supreme in the occupied territories. The arrest made the case different from other violent incidents on the West Bank, but Ikhlas was unimpressed. ""I don't believe that he's going to be charged or he will be punished. He will be there for a few days. Then he will be released,"" Ikhlas said. ""The law that they have for themselves is stronger than our existence. ""Days later, her prediction came true. The soldier's lawyer said he was free. The IDF did not answer a request for comment on the status of the case. The suspect's lawyer accused Saleh of supporting Hamas, but Saleh's family denies any connection to the group. Palestinian authorities say that since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on Oct. 7, 176 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank. Most were killed by Israeli forces in what Israel characterized as counter-terrorism operations. Some were killed by settlers. On Oct. 25, President Biden said he was alarmed by extremist settlers attacking Palestinians in the West Bank, equating it to ""pouring gasoline on fire. "" In a joint press conference with the prime minister of Australia, Biden said, ""They're attacking Palestinians in places that they're entitled to be, and it has to stop. They have to be held accountable. ""The U. S. administration has cautioned Israel against actions that would widen the war, including acts that would inflame the West Bank. But on the question of West Bank settlements, Israeli authorities have often disregarded the advice of their allies. ",npr_articles/article_241.txt,npr_results/article_241.txt.json
242,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/10/1212069162/israel-gaza-fighting-pause-explained,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel has agreed to allow civilians stuck in northern Gaza time to move safely to areas in the south for several hours each day, the White House announced. This ostensibly will also allow more aid to reach Palestinians in Gaza, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Thursday. Going forward, there will be an announcement made three hours before each pause, Kirby said. Israel is referring to this as a humanitarian corridor. ""Israel has an obligation to fully comply with international law, and we believe these pauses are a step in the right direction, particularly to help ensure that civilians have an opportunity to reach safer areas away from the act of fighting,"" Kirby said Thursday. While Israel gave Palestinians six hours on Friday to make it to Gaza's designated safe route, civilians to the north reported that dozens of people were killed in airstrikes around multiple hospitals. Periods to allow for safe evacuations stem from recent discussions between U. S. and Israeli officials. But the agreement — the framework of which is not new — shouldn't be mistaken for a longer-term cease-fire or humanitarian pause. Israel has already held four- or five-hour pauses several times in the past week. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have managed to use them to head to southern Gaza. More than 50,000 civilians in Gaza used the ""humanitarian corridor"" on Thursday, IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said at a press briefing Thursday. Israel also hasn't committed to pausing airstrikes — rather, they agreed to avoid certain areas during this break. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk criticized such a move. ""Demands for civilians to relocate to an Israeli Defence Force designated 'safe zone' are also very alarming. A so-called 'safe zone,' when established unilaterally, can heighten risks to civilians, and raises real questions as to whether security can be guaranteed in practice,"" Türk said in news conference in Amman, Jordan. ""At the moment, nowhere in Gaza is safe, as bombardments are being reported in all parts of the Strip. It also needs to be absolutely clear that civilians are protected under international law wherever they are. ""He repeated a demand for a cease-fire, as many humanitarian groups have done in recent weeks. Establishing a longer humanitarian pause or even a cease-fire is the subject of several ongoing talks over the release of hostages between U. S. officials and leaders in the Middle East. CIA chief William Burns and leaders of Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, met with the Qatari prime minister in Doha Thursday to discuss a deal for releasing the some 240 hostages kidnapped one month ago, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, in Egypt on Friday morning, President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi welcomed the Qatar emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, at the Cairo International Airport. Qatar continues to play a major role in talks to release hostages as it holds the best position to influence Hamas on this issue. An estimated 240 people were kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7. Around 1,400 people in Israel were killed when Hamas attacked more than a month ago. More than 11,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since this war began, according to new data released Friday by health officials in the Hamas-run territory. Overnight, reports from hospitals, aid groups and witnesses on the ground said multiple hospitals had been hit by and suffered damage from Israeli airstrikes. A video posted on social media from a witness in said that Al Rantisi hospital was being surrounded by Israeli tanks and that people were being ordered to leave without the assistance of humanitarian groups, such as the Red Cross, to ensure safety. Overnight ten employees of Al Awda Hospital, in the north of Gaza, were injured and some departments at the hospital were severely damaged after airstrikes targeted the area surrounding the medical facility, according to the Al Awda Health and Community Association. A video shared by the hospital shows the staff cleaning debris from the streets and entrances just outside of the hospital after airstrikes hit the area overnight. The clip also showed severely damaged ambulances. Al Awda Health and Community Association said that at least two ambulances and at least nine other vehicles were damaged or  completely destroyed in the attacks. Several videos also shared overnight showed people injured at a facility that is part of the Al-Shifa Hopsital in Gaza City. It's the largest hospital in Gaza, and has been a shelter for the displaced and injured since the Israeli incursion began. Just a week ago, an Israeli airstrike just outside that hospital killed more than a dozen people. Israel said it targeted Hamas members. The Israeli military maintains it has not directly targeted a hospital, but the health officials in Gaza say the Al-Shifa Medical Complex in the north has been a target for Israeli military airstrikes five times. ""Strikes on hospitals and in the vicinity of hospitals in Gaza City have been particularly intense, especially around the two biggest hospitals in the area — Indonesia hospital in Beit Lahiya and Al Shifa hospital in Gaza City. Meanwhile, the strikes on surrounding areas render access to hospitals difficult, including by destroying roads,"" said Türk, the U. N. 's High Commissioner for Human Rights. ""Some hospitals, including Al Quds and Al Shifa hospitals have also received specific evacuation orders, in addition to the general evacuation orders to all of northern residents of Gaza,"" he said in his speech in Jordan. ""But such evacuation, as the World Health Organization has warned, is a 'death sentence' in a context where the entire medical system is collapsing and hospitals in southern Gaza have no capacity to absorb more patients.

243,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/11/10/1211567204/satellite-images-israeli-military-hold-ground-around-gaza-water-facilities,"Israeli forces that swept into the north of Gaza have taken up positions near vital water infrastructure, satellite imagery from the commercial company Planet reveals. Imagery from Nov. 6 shows Israeli armored vehicles arrayed around a seawater desalination plant on the north side of Gaza City and immediately next to a sewage treatment facility to the south. The water facilities were all occupied shortly after Israeli ground troops moved into Gaza on Oct. 27. Planet imagery suggests that Israeli forces had reached the desalination plant by Oct. 30. Troops reached the wastewater treatment plant south of Gaza City on Nov. 1, according to imagery from Planet and the European Space Agency's Copernicus satellites. A third facility, a sewage treatment plant immediately adjacent to Gaza's border with Israel, appears to have drained its treatment basins within days of the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, according to Planet imagery. But the imagery did not show evidence that Israeli forces are operating near the facility. The Israel Defense Forces declined to answer NPR's queries about the facilities, saying it did not comment on operational activity. Speaking on Monday on ABC News, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel would likely take responsibility for security in Gaza ""for an indefinite period. "" Simply occupying infrastructure like water and power facilities does not necessarily violate the laws of war. ""Infrastructure in warfare is protected,"" says Marc Garlasco, a former United Nations war crimes investigator who now works for the Dutch non-profit PAX. Israeli forces cannot damage or destroy facilities designated essential for human life, he says, but ""just because the Israel Defense Forces are operating around them does not mean they're doing anything nefarious. ""Gaza has long suffered from water and sewage issues. The tiny strip has little surface water, and many of its wells are brackish. It depends on water piped in from Israel, and more recently, a trio of desalination plants that operate along the Mediterranean Coast. Those plants, along with several new sewage treatment facilities, have been funded in recent years by international bodies such as the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Islamic Development Bank. Water and sewage treatment has been mostly inoperable in Gaza for weeks, according to the Palestinian Water Authority. Fuel and electricity shortages led to the shutdown of wastewater and desalination facilities since mid-October, according to information on the authority's Facebook page. Additionally, Palestinian officials say Israel's extensive bombing campaign has damaged pipes and sewers throughout Gaza City. Israel also shut off pipes that supply water from its territory to Gaza shortly after the Hamas attack on Oct. 7. It has since resumed piping water to parts of southern Gaza. But fresh water still remains scarce throughout Gaza. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization warned that a lack of desalination had significantly increased the risk of bacterial infections like diarrhea throughout Gaza. Damaged water and sanitation systems have further increased the risk of disease outbreaks. Since mid-October, the WHO says that diarrhea cases have increased dramatically, with half of all infections in children under 5. Cases of skin rash, chickenpox, scabies and lice are also rapidly on the rise. In addition to the water facilities, the satellite imagery from Planet also shows that Israeli forces have taken up positions in several school buildings throughout North Gaza. The imagery shows Israeli armor parked in courtyards, with additional strong points nearby. When it comes to the laws of war, school buildings are not protected so long as students aren't present, Garlasco says. The decision to use schools is often a tactical one, because the design of many schools offer cover from the enemy, he says. ""It's a building, with a wall around a courtyard, and militaries like that because it's protective for them. ""But the use of schools by militaries has caused problems in the past. In Iraq, in 2003, for example, the U. S. 82nd Airborne Division operated out of a school in Fallujah. Iraqi citizens protested, leading to an incident that killed 17 civilians and wounded 75. Garlasco says that while controlling these kinds of civilian facilities may make sense to the Israeli military in the short-term, he hopes they will hand them back as soon as the fighting is over. ""Gaza is a very dynamic situation,"" he says. ""But you definitely want schools and other civilian infrastructure turned back over to the population as quickly as possible.

Among those killed or kidnapped were more than 50 citizens of Thailand — 34 killed and 24 taken hostage, Thailand's ambassador to the U. S. , Tanee Sangrat, confirmed to NPR Wednesday. Nineteen more Thais were injured in the attacks. Many hailed from the same impoverished region of northeastern Thailand that Namsan comes from. Thais make up the largest group of foreign nationals working in Israel, mostly employed doing unskilled labor in the country's farms. Despite the barrage of Hamas rockets he witnessed that day, Namsan, 27, says initially he wasn't too worried. Although things had been quiet along the Gaza border for a few months leading up to Oct. 7, he'd seen incoming rockets before — they weren't targeting the farm fields where he worked, but instead appeared bound for Israeli cities farther away. He assumed the same was true last month. He was unaware that the attacks were in fact targeting kibbutzim, where he and other foreign laborers were working. He only learned that days later. The news didn't come through any official channel. He learned it instead on a Facebook page run by fellow Thais working in Israel. Among those Hamas killed were several Thai farmhands who worked north of him. Namsan didn't know them well, but says they'd played a few pickup games of soccer together. The news shocked him. He approached his Israeli employer about going home, was made current on his wages and later boarded a Thai government evacuation flight. Now, back at home in Thailand, he's theoretically on a 45-day holiday mandated in his contract. But ""if things get better in that time, I was told I can just come back and finish out my contract,"" he says. Namsan wonders if and when he'll be able to return to Israel. ""I want to go back. In Isaan I can't make any money,"" he says, using the Thai name for the northeastern region where he lives. Rice and sugar-cane cultivation dominate the heavily agricultural area, where the average monthly income per household reported in 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, amounted to less than $600. Yahel Kurlander, a sociology professor at Tel-Hai College in northern Israel who studies the country's Thai migrant population, says in 2012, Israel and Thailand forged a bilateral agreement to ease entry for Thai farm workers. Some 30,000 Thais were working in Israel prior to last month's Hamas attack. Namsan is one of more than 7,000 who have since chosen to go home — at least temporarily, Kurlander says. ""The majority of Thai workers actually stayed in Israel,"" she says. ""[They] are completely safe because they are located in areas . . . far from Gaza. ""Phairin Phuangsri, who works about 60 miles east of Gaza, is one of them. ""We have a lot of soldiers here and we aren't concerned,"" says Phuangsri, 41, who comes from a small village near Surin, Thailand, and has worked in Israel harvesting tomatoes and eggplant for about three years. His family in Thailand, however, is on edge, he admits. They've seen videos of the death and destruction in the aftermath of the Hamas attack and learned of the deaths of the 34 Thais who were killed. They are worried he will get injured or killed, and have implored him to come home. ""I keep telling them, it's not like that where I am. I'm fine,"" he insists. Julie Fox, a researcher for Hostage Family Forum, an Israeli nonprofit which advocates for Hamas abductees, says that while the fate of Israeli hostages captured on Oct. 7 dominates the international media, the 24 Thais — as well as Nepalis, a Filipino and a Tanzanian who are believed to have been kidnapped in the attacks — have received much less attention. Nepali agricultural students were also reportedly killed Oct. 7, as were at least two Filipinos. Using Facebook and other means, Fox has been trying to track down and inform families in Thailand to let them know of loved ones who are either missing or dead. ""It's taken a very long time for anyone from the [Thai] government to be in touch,"" Fox says. ""I'm often the first person to speak to them, and I'm not an official at all. I'm a volunteer. ""Kurlander also asserts that ""the Thai government is working very, very slowly, letting the families know. ""Sangrat, the Thai ambassador to Washington, tells NPR that Thailand's Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin and the country's Ambassador to Israel Pannabha Chandraramya ""have worked very hard to disseminate this information to all the [Thai] workers and nationals in Israel. "" Officials are doing everything they can to reach the families of victims, he says. ""I think that we all try to do our best to facilitate and offer assistance to our workers,"" Sangrat says. Thai authorities have reportedly been working unofficially through Iran, which supports Hamas, to secure the release of their hostages, U. S. and Israeli media have reported. Sangrat tells NPR that Thai Muslim leaders are ""working with many Middle Eastern countries with whom we have close and friendly relations to secure and expedite the safe release of Thai hostages,"" but says he has no information ""about specific countries and channels that they employ these efforts. ""Israeli officials are already eyeing options for filling the gap left by the Thai laborers who've departed, as well as thousands of Palestinian workers expelled by Israel since the Hamas attack. A just-signed bilateral agreement with Sri Lanka opens the door to hiring 10,000 farm laborers from that country. But even before the Hamas attack, in May, a similar deal was inked with India to import some 42,000 Indian laborers to replace Palestinians in the construction industry. Meanwhile, Namsan says he feels like he's in limbo — wanting to return to Israel, but not sure if now is the right time. There are other options for Thai laborers closer to home — in South Korea, for example, but the government there requires a test of Korean language skills. One of the draws of Israel, Namasan says, is that it has no such language requirement for Hebrew. As for Phuangsri, after three years in Israel, he's finally managed to pay off debts back in Thailand. He's just to the point where he can begin saving for his family's future, he says. ""I'm not ready to go back,"" Phuangsri says, despite his family's pleadings. ""In my village, I work hard but don't earn anything. I'd rather stay here and make money.

245,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/09/1211571220/israel-gaza-damage-map-satellite-imagery,"A month into the war between Israel and Hamas, images of widespread destruction, craters and collapsed buildings have become commonplace. Despite the photos and footage, a comprehensive survey of damaged properties on the ground is impossible at the moment, due to the ongoing conflict. But new analysis of imagery from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 satellite allows for what researchers say is likely to be the most comprehensive look yet at the scale of damage in the Gaza Strip. On Oct. 7, Hamas-led militants stormed from the Gaza Strip into Israel, killed 1,400 people and took more than 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials. In response, Israel's military has launched near-continuous airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, killing over 10,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and displacing nearly 1. 5 million people, according to United Nations figures. Since the onset of the war, an estimated 27% to 35% of all buildings in the northern half of the territory have likely been damaged, according to analysis by Corey Scher of New York's CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University. Throughout the Gaza Strip, they estimate that between 13% and 18% of all structures have been destroyed or damaged, a range of 38,000 to 51,500 buildings. ""It's just steadily increasing,"" said Van Den Hoek, a satellite imagery and remote sensing expert who has been studying this imagery since the war's onset. ""There's broad damage in areas where people live — cities, refugee camps. "" The Gaza Strip is a narrow section of land situated between the Mediterranean Sea, Egypt and Israel. Its footprint is roughly equal to that of the city of Philadelphia, but with a half million more people, many packed into concrete high-rises in tight cities up and down the coast. On Oct. 13, the Israeli military ordered all residents of northern Gaza — over 1 million people — to evacuate to south of the Wadi Gaza, a river that roughly splits the Gaza Strip in two. At the time, the United Nations said it would be ""impossible"" for so many people in Gaza to move without ""devastating humanitarian consequences. "" Nevertheless, bombing raids have intensified throughout the Gaza Strip, especially in the north where the Israeli military has surrounded Gaza City. The Israeli military says it's fighting to destroy Hamas, which rules Gaza, so it can no longer attack Israelis. Israel, the United States and the European Union have long designated Hamas a terrorist organization. On Oct. 31, an Israeli airstrike hit the densely populated refugee camp of Jabalia, north of Gaza City. There are news reports of subsequent deadly strikes at Jabalia, which is Gaza's largest refugee camp. Israel has said the attacks killed dozens of militants, including Hamas commanders. The Health Ministry in Gaza said at least 195 people were killed. It is not known how many residents remain in the northern half of the Gaza Strip. The United Nations estimates that over 160,000 displaced people are sheltering in 57 schools across northern Gaza operated by UNRWA, the U. N. relief agency that aids Palestinians. A further 117,000 displaced people are sheltering in hospitals in Gaza City and northern Gaza, they estimate. The World Health Organization said on Oct. 29 that ""evacuation of hospitals is impossible without endangering patients' lives. ""The Israeli military has denied targeting Gaza's hospitals. Despite this, Israeli airstrikes on or near hospitals in the northern half of Gaza continue, according to witnesses and international aid groups. On Friday, Israel struck an ambulance convoy at Gaza's largest medical facility, Al-Shifa Hospital, killing at least 13, according to the World Health Organization. The Israeli military said it struck an ambulance ""being used by a Hamas terrorist cell. "" Israel has said Gaza militants use ambulances to transfer operatives and weapons. On Monday, two rockets landed near the gates of Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said, injuring at least 21. ""We are still seeing extensive, new damage happening in the northern Gaza region,"" says Scher. The researchers noticed a comparative lull in damage from bombardments between Oct. 25 and Oct. 29, prior to Israel's ground invasion that began at the end of last month. But in the most recent satellite data update, from Nov. 5, damage again appears to be widespread and growing. South of Wadi Gaza, airstrikes continue, though at a much slower pace than in the north. There, Scher and Van Den Hoek estimate at least 8,900 buildings have been damaged or destroyed, representing about 5% of all structures in that area. Late on Saturday, bombs fell on Al-Maghazi refugee camp, killing at least 45, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The Israeli military said Sunday that it was looking into whether or not it was active in the area at that time. Nearby, The Associated Press reports that Israeli airstrikes struck near Bureij refugee camp, killing at least 13. Gaza's Health Ministry reports at least 52 mosques and seven churches in the territory have been damaged since the beginning of the conflict. UNRWA says 50 of its installations in Gaza have also been hit with airstrikes or bombs, resulting in the deaths of at least 66 displaced people on their properties and hundreds injured. But as Hamas rocket attacks continue, and artillery shelling and small-arms fire intensifies within the territory, determining the source of the damage detected by satellite imagery becomes increasingly difficult.

247,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/08/1211483883/olympics-russia-israel-gaza-sanctions-ioc,"When violence in Israel and Gaza escalated after last month's terror attack by Hamas, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) issued a statement warning against ""discriminatory behavior"" against Israeli athletes competing around the world. ""[A]thletes cannot be held responsible for the actions of their governments,"" an IOC spokesperson told the German Press Agency, promising ""swift action"" if incidents occur. Russian officials reacted angrily to the IOC's stance toward Israel, noting that in October the Russian Olympic Committee was suspended for actions taken in occupied regions of eastern Ukraine. ""This is, of course, outrageous,"" said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in an interview posted on Telegram. ""Once again we see an example of the bias and ineptitude of the International Olympic Committee, which time and again proves its political bent. ""Olympic officials say the Russian Olympic Committee's (ROC) latest suspension followed Moscow's decision to absorb sports organizations in four occupied territories of Ukraine, describing that action as a ""breach of the Olympic charter. ""According to an IOC statement, the ROC ""cannot receive any funding from the Olympic movement"" including revenue from international broadcast rights. Russia's sports programs have faced a series of sanctions since 2017 after it was revealed that coaches and trainers created a nationwide system of athletic doping using banned substances. It's still unclear whether Russian athletes will be allowed to compete independently - without flying Russia's flag or playing the Russian national anthem — during the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, though that appears likely. Lavrov said the two cases show clear bias between the treatments of Russia and Israel. ""[The IOC] actively supports everything that meets the interests of Western countries, primarily the United States, and tries to find wordings that generally props up this policy,"" Lavrov said on Nov. 2. In a separate statement, an IOC spokesman said the situation involving Russia and Ukraine is unique and ""shouldn't be compared to any other war or conflict in the world. "" Russia has now appealed the IOC's decision to an international tribunal called the Court of Arbitration for Sport, based in Switzerland, which says it will review the case. ""[T]he parties are exchanging written submissions and the panel of arbitrators that will decide the matter is being constituted,"" CAS said in a statement on Monday. Jules Boykoff, a professor at Pacific University who studies politics and the international Olympic movement, predicted the IOC will face growing pressure and questions over Israel's ground war in Gaza. ""Palestine is a participant in the Olympics, they have their own national Olympic committee and it remains to be seen whether territory will actually be captured by Israel and kept,"" Boykoff said. ""That would be in clear violation [of the Olympic charter] in the same way as what Russia has done,"" he added. Boykoff said an increasingly volatile global situation - with wars in the Middle East and eastern Europe and growing tensions between the U. S. and China — has shaken the Olympic movement in ways the IOC is struggling to manage. ""In reality sports are politics by other means and that is becoming ever more clear the closer we get to Paris 2024,"" he said. ""It's going to be a heck of a summer in Paris, that's for sure. ""Eight months out from the Paris Summer Olympics, France has already seen large pro-Palestinian protests. Israel and the Palestinians have a fraught Olympic history. In 1972, members of Black September — an affiliate of the Palestine Liberation Organization - took Israeli athletes hostage at the Munich Summer Games. Eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team died in the terror attack, along with a German policeman and five Palestinian terrorists. According to a 2022 NPR report, about 900 million people are believed to have watched the hostage crisis on television. ""From start to finish, it was the first time terrorists had hijacked a televised event and turned it into their own drama,"" said Bruce Hoffman, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who has studied terrorism for decades. In May, French officials unveiled their security plans for next summer's Olympic events, saying that 35,000 uniformed police will patrol the event.",npr_articles/article_247.txt,npr_results/article_247.txt.json
248,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/08/1211459955/gaza-massachusetts-family-home,"It took 27 days — of constant bombardment, dwindling food and water, sleepless nights and pleas for help — before Wafaa Abuzayda, her husband Abood Okal and their 1-year-old son Yousef could escape from Gaza. The three had been visiting relatives for the first time in upwards of six years when Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7. They were among the roughly 600 Americans who found themselves trapped in Gaza as Israel retaliated with air strikes and, later, a ground invasion. They evacuated to the south, where they sheltered in a house with some 40 other people near the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, ready to rush over at a moment's notice if they got word the gate would open. Abuzayda and Okal slept on the floor, careful to keep Yousef sandwiched between them so that if a bomb did hit, they would all die together. ""I used to ask God: 'If you want to take us, take three of us,' "" Abuzayda told Morning Edition. ""Not one of us, not two of us: three of us. Every day I used to pray for that. "" They called the U. S. embassies in Jerusalem and Cairo for weeks asking for help. With each passing day they felt increasingly abandoned by their own government as they ran low on necessities and grew more cut off from the outside world. They went to the Rafah crossing multiple times at the direction of the State Department, only to be turned away. The three were finally able to cross into Egypt and travel back to Massachusetts earlier this week. Abuzayda and Okal say they are grateful to the State Department employees who helped them and relieved to be home. But their families — and minds — are still in Gaza. Okal's parents are torn about whether to leave, knowing his three siblings — and their spouses and children — cannot. Abuzayda's parents were expecting to leave with them, but found out at the border that their names weren't on the list of those allowed to cross. The couple say they're even more worried about their relatives now, since it's harder to communicate with them from overseas. That's on top of the survivors' guilt they feel for leaving the enclave of 2. 3 million people, where nearly 11,000 lives have been lost in just over a month and many others have been irrevocably changed. ""I had . . . mixed feelings about if I'm happy or not, because we left a lot of people behind,"" Abuzayda said. ""I wish we could take the 2 million with us. "" Saying goodbye to their families was the hardest moment of the past month, Abuzayda said, because they didn't know if they would see each other again. Her dad even called her afterward to give instructions in case that happened, in what was essentially a living will. Okal said they were so focused on getting to safety, primarily for their son's sake, that they ""didn't realize what actually departing meant until we did it. "" They established unimaginably close bonds with the family members and strangers they were sheltering with, and leaving them behind in such uncertainty ""is not to be underestimated. ""He said he and Abuzayda both cried while taking their first showers after getting to Cairo, because they hadn't had one for weeks — and knew that their parents still could not. Abuzayda has been texting her family constantly and will start to panic if she doesn't hear from them within an hour — which can happen often, since the internet connection can go out for days at a time in Gaza. The updates they do get are particularly visceral for them. ""We know . . . how is the feeling when they hear the bombing and everything, the sounds, how we freak out, how we jump,"" Abuzayda said. ""Every time we hear there is a loud sound just next to them, I cry because I know how does it look like. "" There's often a considerable delay between hearing about an air strike on the news and confirming that their relatives are OK, Okal added. Just hours before speaking to NPR, he learned that one of his cousins had lost three of her children in a bombing several days earlier.  He said there's no way to confirm how many people they have lost, both because the connectivity is bad and because so many people are still missing or trapped in the rubble. ""As soon as, hopefully, this comes to a stop, I think that's really when the magnitude of personal loss will unfold,"" he said. The families of Abuzayda and Okal — who are both U. S. citizens — have told them this war is worse than anything they've experienced there before. And the two say their homeland is no longer the Gaza they used to know. Abuzayda vividly remembers the day they drove from the north to the south, after the Israel Defense Forces told people to evacuate. She and Okal, in separate cars, lost service for several hours and ultimately ended up coordinating by calling her brother, who lives in the West Bank. She saw many others making the journey on foot, carrying their clothes and belongings. She said it reminded her of the 1948 mass displacement of Palestinians that Palestinians call the Nakba, meaning catastrophe. As they drove, they passed the remnants of many of the places they used to love — restaurants and beach areas, now gone. ""I can't forget what I saw that day,"" she added. Abuzayda and Okal hope the remaining Americans in Gaza can get the same help leaving. But that doesn't stop the fear, the misery, the danger for the rest of the Palestinians trapped in the Gaza Strip. ""Every minute that passes by, another child is killed, another innocent life is lost,"" Okal said. ""And I think that needs to stop. "" Okal hopes the war will end ""before it's too late,"" though believes ""in many aspects"" it is already is. He points to the civilian death toll, especially among children, as well as the scarcity of food and water and the destruction of infrastructure. ""Hopefully new construction and rebuilding of Gaza happens, but it would be a different Gaza,"" he said. ""And I think the scars that are left with people — not just the physical ones, but the the mental ones and the emotional ones — are going to be hard to heal. "" The two are saddened that this was their young son's first experience in Gaza. It's hard for them to envision a world in which they don't return, but at this point they aren't sure they ever will. In fact, Abuzayda said, she doesn't want to leave the U. S. at all, out of concern she wouldn't be able to get back if something bad happened.  ""My answer is I don't want to fly again,"" she said. ""That's it. It doesn't matter where, but I don't want to fly again. "" The broadcast interview was produced by Taylor Haney and edited by Arezou Rezvani.

249,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/08/1210712449/north-israel-hospitals-go-underground-lebanon-hezbollah,"NAHARIYA, Israel — When you visit the Galilee Medical Center in northern Israel, you can hardly tell you're underground. There are nursing stations, hospital beds and a separate neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU. There are familiar hospital scenes: a father caressing the feet of his newborn, family members crowded around the bed of an ailing loved one, and a nurse drawing blood. The community hospital in Nahariya is just 6 miles from the border with Lebanon — where tensions and fighting between Israel and Lebanese militants are intensifying. The Israeli military says about 125,000 people have been evacuated from the border region to points south. ""We are underground with the patients because we are preparing ourselves to continue taking care of our patients, even under fire,"" explains Dr. Masad Barhoum, the director of the hospital. He's wearing a protective vest over his dress shirt. It took only a few hours to move the first patients underground on Oct. 7, when Hamas-backed militants crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking over 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials. In the month since, Israel has bombarded Gaza, run by Hamas, killing more than 10,000 Palestinians and damaging overcrowded hospitals there, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The war has also ignited what experts are so far calling a ""limited spillover"" of conflict between Israeli forces and militants in neighboring Lebanon. In northern Israel, the exchange of rocket fire and artillery with Iran-backed Hezbollah and other armed factions in Lebanon comes daily. In recent days, civilians on both sides of the border have died amid dozens of airstrikes. Just outside the hospital in Nahariya, it's common to hear drones and air raid sirens. ""Almost all the hospitals in Israel are preparing for the big war with Hezbollah,"" Barhoum says, ""but we, specifically, are preparing this moment for many years. ""Galilee's wartime protections were used in Israel's 2006 war with Lebanon. During that conflict, a missile from Lebanon hit the fourth floor of the hospital. Staff had already moved their medical care underground, so no one was injured in the attack. All across Israel, but especially in the north, hospitals are moving underground or into fortified areas, or are preparing to do so. In the northwestern city of Haifa, Rambam Health Care Campus, has converted a three-floor underground parking garage into a hospital. Where there used to be parking spots, there are now hospital beds, oxygen hookups, monitors and a respirator. Rambam, Israel's largest trauma hospital, has 1,400 beds underground. ""I'm not familiar with another facility like this in the whole world,"" says Dr. Netanel Horowitz, who is part of the team setting up the garage-turned-hospital in Haifa. ""If we need tomorrow to go down, it's ready. ""Each day, Horowitz says, he and his team are alert to elevated border action that could drive them underground. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, has said he's ready to escalate the war further at any moment, depending on the course of Israel's offensive in Gaza and its behavior toward Lebanon. ""All scenarios are open on our Lebanese southern front,"" he said on Friday in his first speech since the conflict began. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had his own threats for Hezbollah, saying an attack from Lebanon ""will come at a price. ""At Nahariya's Galilee Medical Center, the first unit to go underground was the NICU, where vulnerable babies get medical care. It took staff several hours to move all the equipment and patients down. ""I'm not afraid myself,"" says Dr. Vered Fleisher Sheffer, who runs the unit, ""but the safety is so important to our parents and our most vulnerable babies. "" When NPR visited late last month, there were babies being treated who were delivered as early as 24 weeks, their treatment just as seamless as if there wasn't a war. It's a stark difference from what's happening with the health care system in the Gaza Strip, which was already struggling before Israel launched its latest military response to the Hamas attacks. Eighteen hospitals and most of the primary care centers have stopped functioning due to attacks or lack of fuel since Oct. 7, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Galilee isn't just going underground for safety. The hospital's first floor is fortified to withstand a missile attack, protecting the trauma department, ambulance bay and other surgical rooms from an attack out of Lebanon. Heavy steel doors guard the opening to the first floor trauma center and emergency room. Nearby there's a shower ready in case Lebanon uses chemical weapons. For the last few weeks, the hospital has been receiving Israeli soldiers wounded from fighting in Gaza, as well as more than 200 northern residents who have been injured in rocket attacks from Lebanon. Dr. Bahir Sirhan, who works in the Galilee hospital's emergency department, says there's no need to wait for future escalation. ""The threat is real,"" he says. ""The war is already here. It's here. ""A few weeks ago, Sirhan was working when a call came in that an ambulance was on its way in with four people injured in a rocket attack near the border. Some of the patients, it turned out, were his relatives. ""We have drills to receive such trauma cases, but no one prepared me for receiving family members,"" he says. ""I went from being a doctor to being a family member and it was a bit confusing. It took me several moments to cool down my nerves and start after receiving them. ""He says when the patients recognized him, they called his name, and his presence calmed them down. Their injuries weren't critical and they have since recovered. But the experience still haunts him. ""I don't wish to treat my family again,"" he says. ""That's a nightmare. ""At Rambam Hospital in Haifa, the underground facilities sit mostly empty, but ready. Many parking spots have hospital beds already, other sections have numbers to signify a patient area with hookups, waiting for the beds that are currently in use upstairs to be rolled down. On a recent visit, hospital leaders were running a drill to help nurses and doctors get used to working in the facility. Though the hospital had previously used the underground garage during the COVID-19 pandemic, only a set number of staff had worked in that space, so for many, the practice exercise was the first time they'd been down there. ""I cannot lie and say it's not a terrifying and frightening situation because it is,"" says Alina Maister, an internal medicine nurse who is part of the training exercise and describes the last month in Israel as ""one long day. """"It's better to know what to do, how to do it, and be prepared for the worst so we can manage it in the best way possible,"" she says. While touring the facility, she says she exchanged questioning glances with her fellow nurses. ""It's hard to imagine how our jobs would look down here,"" she says. ""Where is everything? Where will people be? What is the plan?""During the drill, dozens of staff members begin to practice triage and treatment of pretend-patients played by their coworkers and members of the Israeli military. Challenges become obvious: The acoustics make it difficult to hear the patients, and hospital sections — the ICU, the operating rooms — are in new locations, so the staff need to practice rolling the beds in the right direction. But Maister says she's confident they'll figure out what to do in time. ""We know how to handle most situations. I think it's one of the strengths of nurses. ""At Rambam, the pediatric dialysis is already fully functional in the garage. That section of parking spots is buzzing with the hum of nurses, children playing video games and a father listening to a pop song with his daughter. Tal Romano's 4-year-old son Hadar is getting dialysis treatment. ""It makes me feel more comfortable,"" Romano says, sitting next to his son. ""It feels very safe down here. ""While Romano speaks to NPR, a nurse draws a flower in pen on Hadar's leg to make him laugh. Romano says his only critique of getting treatment underground is that Hadar misses the colorful kid-friendly decor of the upstairs unit. ""For the kids, it's a little bit difficult, you know, he doesn't see the outside world,"" says Romano. ""He doesn't get used to it so easily.

250,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/07/1210897789/rafah-crossing-gaza-egypt-israel-hamas-war,"LONDON — Sometimes called the Gaza Strip's ""lifeline,"" the Rafah border crossing with Egypt has come under extreme focus as the latest war between Israel and Hamas grinds into its second month. It is controlled and operated by Egyptian authorities, with Hamas also exercising control over who can pass through — the only Gaza crossing not controlled by Israel. Although Egypt has frequently closed the crossing, adding to Gaza's isolation, the crossing has nevertheless served as a vital link between the besieged territory — which has been under an Israeli-imposed land, sea and air blockade since 2007 — and the rest of the world. The blockade was tightened after the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which Hamas-led militants forced their way into the country and killed 1,400 people, returning to Gaza with more than 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials. Israel's heavy military response has killed more than 10,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Humanitarian groups say Israeli bombings and complete siege of the territory have now made the need even more critical to transport aid through Rafah to Gaza's more than 2 million people. The crossing opened last week for the limited evacuation of foreign passport holders and some critically injured Palestinians. The White House said Sunday that 300 Americans and their families have been able to get out of Gaza in recent days, though other U. S. citizens remain in the territory. On Monday, the Rafah crossing reopened once more for foreign passport holders whose names were included on an approval list, according to a statement by the General Authority for Crossings and Borders, run by the Hamas government in Gaza. On Tuesday, it opened once more for those on a new list of people approved to cross into Egypt. In normal times, Rafah is primarily a civilian crossing for Palestinians needing to go to Egypt for medical care and personal reasons. But with all other borders closed since the conflict began, it has now become the only entry point for what little humanitarian aid has been allowed into the enclave. The Rafah crossing, located on Gaza's 7. 5-mile border with Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, is one of three Gaza Strip border crossings, and the only one that doesn't communicate with Israel. The two other Gaza Strip border crossings are Erez, where people cross into Israel from northern Gaza, and Kerem Shalom, a commercial goods junction with Israel in southern Gaza. Kerem Shalom was the primary crossing for humanitarian aid before the war. Both it and Erez are now closed, leaving Rafah the only way in and out of Gaza. It has never been easy for Palestinians to leave Gaza via Rafah. Any Palestinian wishing to use the crossing must register with local Palestinian authorities two to four weeks in advance, and can be rejected by either Palestinian or Egyptian authorities with little warning or explanation. In the past 10 years, the Rafah crossing has been closed for more days than it has been open. Gaza was part of historic Palestine prior to the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, when more than 750,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes in what Palestinians call al-Nakba, or ""Catastrophe. ""Egypt captured Gaza during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, and consequently there was no border in Rafah. Egypt's Sinai Peninsula — where Rafah is located — was invaded by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Sinai was later returned to Egypt following the Camp David Accords and a 1979 peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. The last Israeli soldiers withdrew from the peninsula in 1982. Israel opened the Rafah crossing following the 1979 peace treaty, and the movement of people from Gaza into Egypt remained in Israel's control from 1982 until 2005. From November 2005, the Rafah crossing came under Egyptian, Palestinian Authority and European Union control — the first time Palestinians had gained partial control of one of their international borders. After Hamas seized control of Gaza in June 2007, the European Union withdrew control of the border. Israel and Egypt's subsequent joint blockade and their decision to shut down the Rafah crossing following the Hamas takeover effectively sealed off the Gaza Strip on all sides. Since then, the crossing has only been intermittently open to Palestinians. To get around the Israeli-imposed economic blockade, smugglers dug hundreds of tunnels beneath the Rafah border, allowing all sorts of goods into the Gaza Strip. Once the secret work of criminals, smuggling became a lifeline for Palestinians in Gaza following the 2007 blockade. Rafah soon became a smuggling hub. Anything from cigarettes to clothing has been smuggled into Gaza via tunnels connecting the Egyptian and Palestinian sides. In 2015, Egypt flooded the tunnels, with the aim of putting an end to the smuggling. Egypt's campaign to destroy the tunnels was largely successful and badly hit Gaza's economy. There have been reports in recent years of Palestinians in Rafah attempting to restore the tunnels. As Israel's pounding of Gaza intensifies and the humanitarian situation worsens, the crossing has become the focal point both for relief efforts and for those hoping to leave the Gaza Strip. Getting aid in and people out has been difficult. As a civilian crossing before the war, Rafah was ill-equipped for a large-scale aid operation. Juliette Touma, director of communications at UNRWA, the U. N. relief agency that aids Palestinians, tells NPR by phone from Amman, Jordan, that organizing aid efforts from the Rafah crossing in response to the conflict has been ""like setting up a humanitarian operation from zero. ""While some aid is now coming into the strip — an average of 30 trucks a day are now getting in since the first aid trucks entered Gaza on Oct. 21 — humanitarian groups say it is nowhere near enough to meet needs. According to Israeli authorities, more than 525 humanitarian aid trucks have entered Gaza since Oct. 21, bringing water, food and medical supplies. ""When you look at the bigger picture, it's absolutely nothing,"" Touma says. ""Before the war started, 100 trucks would deliver aid into the strip every day, and this was before Gaza was under constant bombardment, before more than half the population was displaced. ""No fuel has entered the enclave at all in the last month, says Touma. Most of the aid that came into Gaza before the war was via the Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel. Touma says that with no proper logistics operation set up on the Egyptian side of Rafah, the makeshift aid operation from Rafah is ""geared to fail,"" with trucks having to take a lengthy and cumbersome route through the Sinai Peninsula to reach the crossing point. ""We spend so long getting the trucks to the crossing point, then they go through inspection for hours, then they have to reroute and when they eventually enter Gaza, it's often late at night,"" Touma says. ""Then our [UNRWA teams in Gaza] pick the aid up, often at night, often under a sky full of bombardment. ""Before the crossing partially opened to some aid trucks on Oct. 21, Egypt's foreign minister told CNN the crossing was inoperable due to damage inflicted by Israeli airstrikes on roads linking the Palestinian and Egyptian sides.",npr_articles/article_250.txt,npr_results/article_250.txt.json
251,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/07/1211133698/gaza-hospitals-airstrikes-israel-hamas-war,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Hospitals in Gaza are facing dire conditions as much-needed fuel is running dry and staff try to operate amid overcrowding, disintegrating sanitation and threats from Israel. Health officials in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip report 18 out of 35 hospitals are no longer operational, according to new numbers released Tuesday.  At least 71% of all primary care facilities across Gaza have been shut down due to damage or lack of fuel, the officials said. The United Nations says an estimated 117,000 displaced people, in addition to patients and hospital staff, are in the hospitals still operational in Gaza City and northern Gaza. Israel has dropped leaflets and sent messages telling people to leave these areas as troops close in. ""It's a health catastrophe right now what is happening in Gaza,"" Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesperson for the World Health Organization, told NPR. Over the past few days, several hospitals in Gaza have reported damage from Israeli airstrikes, according to witnesses on the ground and humanitarian aid groups. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said on Monday that an aircraft ""targeted the vicinity of the Al-Quds Hospital with two rockets, approximately 50 meters from the hospital's gate. ""The Rantissi Children's Hospital and the Nasser Hospital Complex also have been damaged through direct and indirect airstrikes, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza and the United Nations.  Israel has also struck Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest medical facility and  where thousands of sick, injured and others are being treated and sheltered, and the Indonesian Hospital. Some strikes have hit the hospitals' infrastructure directly; others struck in their vicinity, like an ambulance convoy outside Al-Shifa on Friday. Health officials in Gaza said that on Nov. 6, Al-Shifa Hospital's fifth floor was hit by Israeli airstrikes, destroying the building's solar panels — the facility's last source for energy. The attack reportedly killed several people, including displaced individuals sheltering there for safety, the health officials said. The constant bombardments are one thing, but these facilities are already struggling to meet the needs of their patients because of the lack of fuel, the WHO's Jasarevic said. ""Doctors need to have electricity in a hospital to be able to perform surgical operations, and they need surgical material. Now, both of those things are missing in most of hospitals. Fuel is running really low. It's the last the liters of fuel that is being used in hospitals and they have to ration it,"" Jasarevic said. ""You have to run generators. You also need to have a light. You can't just do surgeries with the flash flashlight of your mobile phone. ""The Israeli military says that it has not hit any hospitals. These facilities are on the radar of the military, however, because Israel says that it has intelligence that Hamas is hiding in tunnels underneath medical facilities in Gaza. That includes in Gaza's Indonesian and Al-Shifa hospitals. The military believes that there are Hamas tunnels in the vicinity of these medical facilities, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesperson, said on Monday. Hecht said the Israeli military hasn't attacked hospitals, but rather that the military is considering how to deal with those sites to try ""and minimize as much as we can the collateral damage. ""Indonesia's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi disputed Israel's claim and said in a statement that the Indonesian Hospital ""is a facility built by the Indonesian people entirely for humanitarian purposes and to serve the medical needs of the Palestinian people in Gaza. ""B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights group, urged Israel not to bomb Al-Shifa. ""According to Israel, Hamas has chosen to set up a military base underneath the hospital. If that is the case, Hamas is committing a war crime that is morally reprehensible and absolutely prohibited under international humanitarian law,"" the group said in a statement. It continued: ""Even if there is a military facility operating under the hospital, this does not allow Israel to bomb the site. Such an attack would result in unbearable, horrifying harm to civilians and constitute a war crime — violating the provisions of international humanitarian law that Israel has repeatedly declared its commitment to uphold.

252,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/07/1210775385/israel-hamas-gaza-hostages-prisoner-exchange,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Shmuel Brodutch sits under a tent outside Israel's military headquarters every day now, with one demand of his leaders: to strike a deal with Hamas for the release of his three young grandchildren and daughter-in-law. ""The only way to bring them back safe is to have a deal,"" Brodutch said. The U. S. is seeking a pause in the Hamas-Israel war, in order to allow for the release of the roughly 240 hostages taken prisoner inside Gaza during the deadly Hamas massacre of some 1,400 people in southern Israel on Oct. 7. Many Israelis are advocating a far-reaching idea: a historic prisoner exchange in which Israel would release all its Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails. ""All in exchange for all,"" says the poster Brodutch holds under his tent. Hamas has so far released four hostages through Qatar's mediation. It has called for a grand prisoner exchange to release the rest. Israel says no such deal is on the table. Yet a recent Israeli opinion poll found nearly two-thirds of Israelis surveyed support a prisoner exchange. Another poll found split opinions but no overwhelming opposition. Israeli ground troops were able to free one hostage soldier after their incursion into Gaza, but it's unlikely troops can free hundreds of others, with Hamas believed to be holding them in their labyrinth of underground tunnels and chambers. ""If the army will go to free them, a big percentage of them will be dead. I don't want to get my grandchildren back as corpses,"" Brodutch said of his grandchildren, who are four, eight and 10 years old. There is precedent for the idea of a prisoner exchange. In 2011, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to a swap with Hamas, releasing more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel in exchange for the release of captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was held by Hamas in Gaza for five years. One of the released prisoners in that swap is now the head of Hamas in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, whom Israel accuses of helping mastermind last month's attack. That history is why some Israeli families oppose a prisoner exchange. Emuna Nisim Libman's brother is being held in Gaza, but she does not support a prisoner swap to get him back. ""I miss my brother with all my heart, but we know that a ceasefire and prisoner exchange is destructive for our children's future,"" and could lead to another Oct. 7 style attack, she said in a recent video. A massive advocacy effort has been formed by the main group representing family and friends of the Israeli hostages. The group has been careful not to adopt an official position on how Israel should secure their release. ""We're not busy telling government or any other officials how to do that,"" said Shiri Grosbard, whose colleague, Sasha Trupanov, was taken hostage. ""We just want them home. ""But the families have been ramping up pressure on the Israeli government, demanding meetings with Netanyahu and accusing the government of not prioritizing their loved ones' release over Israel's military bombardment on Gaza, which has claimed the lives of at least 10,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials. Individually, families are increasingly advocating the idea of a prisoner exchange with Hamas to bring their loved ones home. ""Definitely,"" said Malki and Shelly Shemtov, whose son, Omer, recently turned 21 in Hamas captivity. A comprehensive prisoner exchange could see Israel release all its Palestinian prisoners. About 6,700 inmates are being held in Israel on what are called security offenses. That includes about 560 serving life sentences for the killing of Israeli civilians and soldiers over the decades, according to Qadoura Fares, a Palestinian official in the West Bank who oversees prisoners' affairs. He said some 65 women and 250 minors are among them. ""It's the most despicable murderers that massacred and killed Jews for years, for decades,"" said Yohanan Plesner, director of the nonpartisan Israel Democracy Institute. ""But at the same time, we have never dealt with such a situation of of so many Israeli hostages, so many innocent Israelis, youngsters, kids, that are held in captivity. ""He said he believes Israelis ""will be willing to go very far in order to get them released, short of one important goal, which is, it's not instead of the goal of dismantling Hamas. ""Standing outside military headquarters, one Israeli, Sarah Tal, offered her own proposal. ""We will let them go from the prison to Gaza, and then we'll kill them in Gaza,"" she said. ""We continue the war. "" It's unclear how Israel can pursue its twin goals of getting hostages released safely and eliminating the very group holding them. What is clear is that many Israelis are open to making a deal with Hamas to secure the captives' freedom.",npr_articles/article_252.txt,npr_results/article_252.txt.json
253,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/06/1210992532/israel-hamas-cease-fire-humanitarian-pause,"As the conflict between Israel and Hamas enters its second month and the death toll in Gaza climbs, humanitarian groups' calls for a cease-fire are growing — though they don't appear to be moving the leaders of Israel or its key ally, the U. S. Israel continues to strike Gaza from the air and on the ground, seeking to remove Hamas from power in response to its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which militants killed some 1,400 people and took another roughly 240 as hostages. More than 10,000 people — mostly women and children — have died in Gaza in the four weeks since, Gaza's Ministry of Health reported on Monday. That same day, the heads of 18 United Nations agencies issued a rare joint statement reiterating their calls for an immediate cease-fire, as well as the immediate and unconditional release of all civilian hostages. ""Enough is enough. This must stop now,"" wrote the signatories, which include the heads of the World Health Organization, UNICEF and the High Commissioner for Refugees. Other activists and world leaders have made similar — and increasingly forceful — pleas in recent days. Tens of thousands of people gathered in Washington, D. C. , this weekend to demand a cease-fire in one of the nation's largest pro-Palestinian protests since the conflict began. Others have taken place in New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco — as well as cities throughout the United Kingdom, Europe and Latin America. Pope Francis renewed his appeal for a cease-fire over the weekend, saying in a speech at the Vatican that ""I implore you to stop, in the name of God. "" Many Arab nations also want an immediate cease-fire, which officials from Jordan and Egypt reiterated after their meeting with U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday. In the U. S. , several progressive House Democrats introduced a resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire, which roughly a dozen lawmakers have signed onto since mid-October. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. , became the first senator to call for one last week, emphasizing that it should only happen after all of the hostages are released. Four of the hostages — including two Americans — have been released so far, and Hamas says dozens have died in Israeli airstrikes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected calls for a cease-fire. He reiterated in a televised address on Friday that one cannot happen without the return of the hostages. ""This should be completely removed from the lexicon,"" he said. ""We say this to our friends and to our enemies. We will simply continue until we defeat them. We have no alternative. ""  The Biden administration, however, is increasingly pushing for a humanitarian pause. The United Nations defines a humanitarian pause as a ""temporary cessation of hostilities purely for humanitarian purposes . . . usually for a defined period and specific geographic area where the humanitarian activities are to be carried out. "" The U. N. defines a cease-fire as ""a suspension of fighting agreed upon by the parties to a conflict, typically as part of a political process . . . Its aim is usually to allow parties to engage in dialogue, including the possibility of reaching a permanent political settlement. "" Israel is opposed to a cease-fire because it has not accomplished its stated goal of dismantling Hamas, Ivo Daalder, a former U. S. ambassador to NATO, told NPR's Morning Edition, adding that Israel's government insists it is ""using force in a proportionate manner, designed to only target those who are direct combatants in the fight. ""But that's not what the rest of the world is seeing, Daalder says. He says the mounting civilian deaths in Gaza are behind the growing calls for a cease-fire — as well as the Biden administration's push to tell Israel that ""you need to really find a way to allow the war to be fought in a more discriminate way that does not necessarily affect all of these civilians. "" The U. S. has publicly supported Israel's right to defend itself and similarly opposed a cease-fire, with Blinken saying that one would allow Hamas to ""regroup and repeat what it did on October 7th. "" But as the death toll rises and domestic protests grow, the Biden administration appears to be looking for a middle ground. After meeting with Netanyahu and his war cabinet in Tel Aviv, Blinken told reporters ""We provided Israel advice that only the best of friends can offer on how to minimize civilian deaths while still achieving its objectives of finding and finishing Hamas terrorists and their infrastructure of violence. "" In recent days, top U. S. officials have asked the Israeli government to pause operations in certain areas of Gaza in order to facilitate the release of hostages and delivery of aid. Just over 450 aid trucks had entered Gaza since the Rafah border crossing reopened on Oct. 21, the U. N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Sunday. It said the daily number of confirmed trucks crossing through is less than 19% what it was before the current conflict. A pause would mean stopping military operations in a specific area for a specific amount of time, in contrast to a broader cease-fire. ""One is temporary and designed to achieve something that's happening on the ground,"" Daalder says. ""The other is designed to be permanent and to end the military phase of the conflict. ""President Biden himself has shown support for the idea, telling supporters during a campaign speech on Wednesday that ""I think we need a pause. "" He also said Netanyahu had agreed to one such pause in order to facilitate the release of the two American hostages from Gaza on Oct. 20. Blinken pushed for more pauses during his visit to Tel Aviv late last week, but does not appear to have persuaded Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister said in his televised address that he had told Blinken: ""We are continuing full force, and that Israel refuses a temporary cease-fire that does not include the return of hostages. ""Blinken told reporters on Sunday that Israel has raised ""important questions"" about how humanitarian pauses would work, and the U. S. is working to answer them. He said on Monday that the two countries are engaged ""on the particular practicalities"" of humanitarian pauses, and called those efforts — both to make progress on hostages and increase aid to Gaza — a work in progress. ""We've engaged the Israelis on steps that they can take to minimize civilian casualties,"" Blinken said. ""We're working . . . very aggressively on getting more humanitarian assistance into Gaza. And we have very concrete ways of doing that, and I think you'll see in the days ahead that that assistance can expand in significant ways so that more gets into people who need it and gets to the people who need it, as well as making sure that people can continue to come out of Gaza. "" The White House said Biden and Netanyahu spoke on Monday morning, including about the ""possibility of tactical pauses to provide civilians with opportunities to safely depart from areas of ongoing fighting, to ensure assistance is reaching civilians in need, and to enable potential hostage releases. ""  It said the two agreed to speak again in the coming days. ",npr_articles/article_253.txt,npr_results/article_253.txt.json
254,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/06/1210847774/gaza-americans-israel-hamas-war-middle-east,"With few journalists on the ground and frequent phone and internet blackouts, it has been hard to get a clear picture of what life is like for people in Gaza. It is becoming a little more clear now that some foreign nationals have been allowed to cross from Gaza into Egypt. One of them is 65-year-old Qassem Ali. Ali grew up in the northeast Gaza village of Beit Hanoun and worked as a journalist. He studied in America, and in 1997, got U. S. citizenship. Over a Zoom call, he told NPR he was visiting his 90-year-old mother in northern Gaza — about two miles from the border with Israel  – when, on Oct. 7, Hamas insurgents crossed into Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 200 others hostage. The morning the war began, Ali was on the rooftop garden of his family home. ""I love gardening, so I have a nice rooftop,"" he said. ""I hear the missiles . . . and, you know, [as a] former journalist, I start filming. ""His video shows a lush garden full of plants. There is a sunrise and the sounds of birds chirping, and then — explosions. One after another. And close. ""I figure it will be serious,"" Ali recalled. ""So I decided to take a shower before the Israelis — I know it's crazy but that's the reality — I took a shower quickly because I don't want to be dying while I'm naked, you know?""He and his mother fled to his sister's apartment in Gaza City. The missiles from Israel followed them there, so they fled again. The days started to blur together. ""You don't know days, my friend,"" he said. ""You don't know if it's Monday or Friday, all the days are the same. If you ask me now what's the day, I don't know. That's the life of war. Especially this war. "" ""I have been covering all the wars in Gaza . . . but this is different. This is not just a war. This is more than a war. ""In the four weeks since the conflict began, more than 10,000 people have died in Gaza, according to the Ministry of Health. Despite all this — despite the violence, despite not knowing what day it is, despite being a U. S. citizen — Ali said he didn't think about trying to leave. Not at first. ""I wanted to stay with my sister and my mother,"" he said. But then he managed to talk to his 13-year-old daughter Nadia, who lives in Canada. ""And I couldn't die without seeing her. So then I decided to leave,"" he said. Ali said he didn't hear anything from the American government, even after he registered as a citizen trying to leave. But it was his American passport that eventually got him out — through the Rafah crossing into Egypt this past Friday. He said those who crossed were put on a bus and they traveled for hours through checkpoints and searches until they eventually arrived at a hotel in Cairo Saturday morning. ""The only thing I wanted to do is just go have a shower,"" he said. ""For 26 days, you don't even wash your face or brush your teeth, and [you are] in the same clothes. And it's hot during the day, and you're sweating. ""Ali spoke to All Things Considered host Mary Louise Kelly on Sunday from Cairo, where he said he was preparing to move on to Malta. As for what's next, Ali said he wants to see his daughter in Canada — and his other kids — but not  right away. He said he needs time, psychologically and physically, and he wants to protect his kids from what he has experienced. He doesn't want to bring the war to them.

255,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/06/1210713218/israel-says-hamas-wont-rule-gaza-so-who-will,"TEL AVIV — As Israel presses its military operation in the Gaza Strip, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country will never again let Hamas rule the territory. But here's the problem for Israel: Right now, no one else wants to rule the Gaza Strip. Israel's immediate goal of removing Hamas is a major military challenge that's likely to take two to six months, according to Yaakov Amidror, a former general and national security advisor in Israel. ""We will not allow an organization to be on the other side of the of the fence with capabilities to attack the civilians and to launch rockets into Israel,"" said Amidror, who is now a military analyst at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security. Israel launched its ground operation on Oct. 27, and troops have swiftly taken over much of northern Gaza, and encircled Gaza City, the largest urban center. But taking full control of the territory may be the easy part. The more daunting challenge could be finding a replacement who's willing and able to run Gaza. Israel withdrew all its troops and Jewish settlers from Gaza in 2005 after nearly four decades. There's no desire for another extended stay, said Amidror, expressing a sentiment that many current Israeli officials have also stated. ""We don't want to take responsibility for 2 million Palestinians to rebuild Gaza,"" he said. So who might take on such a monumental task?Orna Mizrahi, a former deputy national security advisor, concedes there's no clear candidate. ""If you want to replace Hamas, who is going to come afterwards? What is going to be 'the day after?' This is the big question,"" said Mizrahi, now with Israel's Institute for National Security Studies. The Palestinian Authority nominally leads the Palestinians in the West Bank, but is widely seen as weak and ineffective. The PA used to run Gaza, as well. U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that over time a ""revitalized"" Palestinian Authority could return to Gaza. But that seems unrealistic at the moment, said Mizrahi. ""I'm not sure that the Palestinian Authority will want to come after Israel,"" she said. In fact, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas — who turns 88 years old next week — reportedly told Blinken that, ""I will not return (to Gaza) on top of an Israeli tank. ""Hamas took charge in Gaza by first winning Palestinian elections in 2006. The following year, Hamas militants drove the Palestinian Authority out in a bloody one-week battle. Since then, Israel and Hamas have battled repeatedly, but the Israeli military operations were always limited, and it sought to degrade, but not to oust the militant group. This time, Netanyahu says Israel will destroy Hamas and never allow it to have political or military power in Gaza again. ""So anything less than that will be viewed as a failure,"" said Chuck Freilich, a former deputy national security advisor. ""Whether you think it's the right thing to do or not, the (Israeli) government may have just roped themselves into doing that. ""Privately, Israeli officials are talking about bringing in the international community to help run a future Gaza. But no one is raising a hand to volunteer at this point, and prospects are not promising. Neighboring Egypt isn't interested. The Egyptians have long sought to keep Gaza's chaos from spilling over its border. Wealthy Arab states like Qatar cut large checks to Gaza, but show no interest in getting directly involved. The United Nations has long provided basic services likes food, health care and schooling in Gaza, but is not equipped to govern. In addition, Freilich says, Hamas would not accept rule by outsiders, especially someone installed by Israel. ""How do you keep them in power? Remnants of Hamas will be doing their best to kill the guy who's in power,"" he said. Yaakov Amidror said Israel should remember an important precedent. Israel invaded southern Lebanon in 1982 to drive out Palestinians attacking northern Israel. Israel did push out the Palestinians, but then found themselves stuck in southern Lebanon. Meanwhile, the Lebanese group Hezbollah emerged and developed into a much more potent force than the Palestinians that Israel had evicted. Israel finally left southern Lebanon in 2000 in a unilateral pullout. Hezbollah continues to fire rockets on northern Israel to this day. At the moment, the skirmishes on Israel's northern border are limited. But Israel is deeply concerned that Hezbollah could turn the northern border into a second front in the war. ""We learned the hard way in Lebanon,"" said Amidror. ""We cannot be the kingmakers. You cannot come from outside and determine who will be the Palestinian government. They have to make decisions. They have to make the choice. ""But right now, it's hard to see any good choices. Greg Myre is an NPR national security correspondent who was based in Jerusalem from 2000-2007.

256,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/06/1210831466/death-toll-gaza-israel-hamas-conflict,"TEL AVIV, Israel — The conflict between Israel and Hamas has reached a gruesome milestone: More than 10,000 people have died in Gaza in the four weeks since the conflict began.  On Monday, the Ministry of Health in Gaza reported more than 10,000 people killed — most of them women and children — in the besieged territory. In the West Bank, 155 people have been killed since Oct. 7, the health ministry says. There have been more than 100 attacks on health care facilities according to several humanitarian groups, including the U. N. agency for Palestinian refugees, or UNRWA. The groups also reported 88 workers with UNRWA have been killed since Oct. 7, ""the highest number of United Nations fatalities ever recorded in a single conflict. ""This all started nearly one month ago, on Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked several communities in Israel, killing 1,400 people and kidnapping around 240 people. Israeli forces launched an intense response that included a bombardment on Gaza from the air and ground invasion, with the ultimate goal of eliminating Hamas. More than 340 Israeli soldiers have died since the Oct. 7 attacks, Israel said. Humanitarian groups like the UNRWA continue to plead for the release of hostages and for each party to agree to a cease-fire. ""We need an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. It's been 30 days. Enough is enough. This must stop now,"" the aid groups said. On Sunday, Israeli forces reached the coast of Gaza, splitting the besieged area in half and essentially cutting off the north from the south, Israel's military said. ""In the last 12 hours, the soldiers of the division struck around 50 targets, including combat zones, operational residences, outposts, military positions and underground infrastructure, and eliminated terrorists in close-quarter combat,"" the military said. Phone, 4G cellular networks as well as internet services were cut off in Gaza for several hours. By Monday morning local time, the networks appeared to have been at least partially restored. Israeli bombs hit refugee camps. One attack on the Maghazi refugee camp early Sunday killed at least 33 people and wounded dozens, health officials in the region said. The Rafah border crossing was reopened Monday for foreign passport holders whose names appeared on the approval list, according to a statement by the General Authority for Crossings and Borders, which is run by the Hamas government in Gaza. Individuals whose names don't appear on the list will not be allowed to leave Gaza. As fighting around Gaza City continues, many Palestinians are trying to head south as Israel's military continues to urge civilians to do. On Sunday, for the second day in a row, Israel's military announced another window for civilians in the north of Gaza to travel south. A day earlier, the military also allowed passage for a few hours, but people trying to flee found the roads impassable. Israel has accused Hamas of firing on Israeli troops who were attempting to secure the route for civilian passage. The United Nations estimates that of the roughly 300,000 people trapped in northern Gaza, only 2,000 were able to move south this weekend, according to monitors on the ground. The ones that have managed to flee have mostly traveled by foot for miles — adults carrying babies or pushing wheelchairs with the elderly, and holding the hands of children lugging bags full of whatever belongings they could grab. Some waved white pieces of cloth to show they were civilians. They walked by piles of rubble, looking exhausted, as shells exploded in the distance. NPR spoke with a group traveling in Gaza who said they had to walk past dead bodies rotting in the street as bombs dropped in the distance.  They declined to provide their names over security concerns. President Joe Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday morning, discussing the efforts to release hostages held by Hamas and ramping up humanitarian aid to Gaza, the White House said. While Biden reiterated ""his steadfast support for Israel and the protection of Israeli citizens from Hamas and all other threats,"" the White House said the two leaders discussed the possibility of ""tactical pauses"" to allow civilians to leave areas of ongoing fighting, to ensure assistance is reaching civilians and to enable hostage releases. Biden also raised the need to hold extremist Israeli settlers in the West Bank accountable for violence against Palestinians, which has escalated since the Oct.  7 attacks. Their conversation followed U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's busy weekend tour of the Middle East, finishing with a stop in Turkey on Monday. On Sunday, he made an unannounced visit to Iraq and met with Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in Baghdad for more than an hour. Blinken also made trips to Israel and Jordan and had a sit-down with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah in the West Bank. Blinken's stop in Turkey comes as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan strongly criticized Israel and Netanyahu this weekend. Blinken met with Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan to discuss, among other things, the war and the need to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza, he told the media. Despite this whirlwind visit, Blinken's efforts yielded little obvious progress on cease-fire talks or increasing humanitarian aid to Gaza. Blinken said he remained optimistic and told the media, ""We're working on all of this almost every single minute. ""CIA Director William Burns is reportedly visiting Israel Monday, as well.

About 1,400 people were killed in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel and more than 240 people were kidnapped. In the four weeks since, almost 10,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks on Gaza. The week ended with demonstrations across the globe, calling for a cease-fire and a humanitarian end to the violence. Here is a look at scenes from the past week.",npr_articles/article_257.txt,npr_results/article_257.txt.json
258,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/05/1210641727/israel-war-hamas-latest-updates,"TEL AVIV, Israel — A scattered group of runners hustled along the sparkling blue water of the Mediterranean Sea in Tel Aviv's Jaffa Port early Saturday morning. They gathered not to run for themselves, but for the more than 240 hostages still held by Hamas. Each of the runners wore Israeli flags or a race bib that said ""Bring them home"" and bore the images and names of individuals taken by Hamas. That same evening, people gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for demonstrations in support of the hostages. Other protests were held criticizing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government for a perceived failure of properly preparing for, and reacting to, the attack by Hamas. At a crowded rally in downtown Tel Aviv Saturday night, makeshift memorials were erected inside the plaza of the city's art museum square honoring those still missing. Friends and families of the kidnapped and concerned Israelis wore shirts and carried signs with the names and faces of those being held hostage. The events were held on the weekend ahead of the one-month mark since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, when at least 1,400 people were killed. Margalit Zur, a 77-year-old Israeli woman who called for the immediate return of the hostages during the rally Saturday, said her trust in her government and her feeling of safety in Israel have been shaken. She's unable to think of little else other than the children and babies kidnapped by Hamas, she said. ""I really can't sleep. It's terrible,"" she said. ""I can't grasp the tragedy. It's impossible. And I think our government shouldn't do anything before all of them are back home safe. ""In the four weeks since that attack, Israel's intensifying military response to the Hamas attack has killed almost 10,000 people in Gaza and created a dire humanitarian crisis there. There appears to be no end in sight to the nearly month-old war as Netanyahu continues to reject calls for any kind of cease-fire or pause in the fighting. ""I made it clear that we are going with full steam ahead, and that Israel refuses any temporary ceasefire that does not involve the release of the kidnapped Israelis,"" Netanyahu said in a statement Friday. Here's where things stand a month into this war between Israel and Hamas:Nearly 10,000 people have died in Gaza since Oct. 7, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza, which says a majority of the killed are women and children. Almost 25,000 people have been injured and thousands of others are estimated to be missing. A third communications blackout started in Gaza Sunday night, cutting off Palestinians from the outside world. Hospitals and refugee camps have been hit multiple times in Israeli airstrikes. Israeli warplanes struck the Maghazi refugee camp in the Gaza Strip early Sunday, killing at least 33 people and wounding dozens, health officials in the  region said. The World Health Organization issued a bulletin saying it has documented 102 attacks on health care facilities in Gaza since Oct. 7. Hospitals that haven't been touched by attacks are overcrowded and barely functioning due to low supplies and little to no fuel, according to the World Health Organization and the United Nations. The WHO warned on Friday that the bombardments, lack of food, barely working health centers and collapsing infrastructure pose particular risks for pregnant women and children. ""There are an estimated 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza, with more than 180 giving birth every day. Fifteen per cent of them are likely to experience pregnancy or birth-related complications and need additional medical care,"" the WHO said. U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made another whirlwind tour of the region this weekend in an effort to work U. S. partnerships to prevent hostilities from widening, and to continue to try to broker a deal that would allow more humanitarian aid to enter Gaza and to protect civilians. On Sunday, he made an unannounced visit to Iraq and met with Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in Baghdad for more than an hour. Blinken also made trips to Israel, Jordan and had a sit-down with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah in the West Bank on Sunday. A spokesman for Abbas said he had called for an immediate cease-fire and the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. But while Blinken met with Abbas, protesters took to the streets in Ramallah and burned images of the secretary. Asked about progress toward a cease-fire or a pause in hostilities to allow for humanitarian aid to reach those in Gaza, Blinken said his team was continuing to work with the Israeli government to ""work through the specifics. ""But, he said, the release of hostages being held by Hamas is part of those talks. ""The prospect of getting the hostages back can also advance other things that we're committed to doing, as is the government of Israel and other partners of the region — especially getting more humanitarian assistance to people who need it in Gaza,"" he said. After painstaking negotiations between Israel, Hamas and Egypt, officials agreed to allow one border crossing to Egypt in Rafah to open, allowing some aid to enter and some foreign nationals and a few Palestinians to leave. But officials in Gaza closed this exit this weekend, saying foreign passport holders will not be allowed to leave unless patients from the hospitals in Gaza City and northern Gaza are permitted to get to the crossing. On Sunday morning, a senior U. S. official confirmed that more than 300 Americans had left Gaza in recent days, but did not confirm how many remain inside the territory. ""We believe that there are still a number of Americans inside Gaza, but that over the last several days, through pretty intensive negotiations with all sides relevant to this conflict, we have been able to get out more than 300 Americans, lawful permanent residents and their family members,"" Principal Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told Face the Nation. On Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces announced a brief three-hour window for the roughly 300,000 people estimated to be trapped in northern Gaza to travel safely on the road to southern Gaza. Few were able to access this so-called safe passageway. The IDF said Hamas militants attacked the roadway. Hamas said the availability of a safe corridor was ""a lie"" and that the Israeli military was using it to attack civilians. Aid has slowly been able to enter Gaza, but humanitarian groups have demanded more supplies to reach Palestinians. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society reported over the weekend that since Oct. 21 at least 451 trucks, around 30 per day, have been able to deliver aid through the Rafah crossing. ""However, Israeli authorities have not allowed the entry of fuel up to this moment,"" the organization said. The movements by Palestinians elsewhere have also been limited. Israeli authorities have also indefinitely paused the worker permits for the more than 110,000 Palestinians that worked in Israel or Israeli settlements. The brutal attack by Hamas shocked Israel and the world, but Israel's offensive in response has also stunned many in its aggression. In a statement on Sunday morning, Israel said ""over 2,500 terror targets have been struck"" in the combined activities of its ground, air and naval forces in the Gaza Strip during their offensive over the past four weeks. The IDF maintains that it targets only infrastructure it believes is housing Hamas fighters inside or in the group's underground tunnels. Over the weekend, demonstrators around the world called for the end to the violence and for Israel to call for a cease-fire. In Washington, D. C. , at least tens of thousands of people gathered Saturday for one of the biggest pro-Palestinian protests in the U. S. since the Israeli incursion began. The Biden administration has said it continues to stand by Israel and its ""right to defend itself. ""There are growing worries on Capitol Hill over the high casualty count in Gaza, but few lawmakers have publicly called for a pause in the fight. As of early November, 18 House members have split with the Biden administration's pro-Israeli stance and signed a resolution calling for a cease-fire. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy is one of the first senators to publicly express concerns over Israel's response to Hamas, calling for a more ""deliberate and proportionate counterterrorism campaign. """"The current rate of civilian death inside Gaza is unacceptable and unsustainable. I urge Israel to immediately reconsider its approach and shift to a more deliberate and proportionate counterterrorism campaign, surgically targeting Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders and terrorist infrastructure while more highly prioritizing the safety of civilians in accordance with the law of armed conflict,"" he said in a recent statement. About three weeks after the Hamas attack, the Israeli government launched a military ground invasion into Gaza. ""Our forces are operating on all of fronts, with full power. Our victory will be decisive and clear. It will send a message to our enemies – one that will echo for generations,"" Netanyahu said on Friday.  By Sunday evening, the military's 36th Division had reached positions along the coast of Gaza following the expansion of Israeli ground operations over the past seven days, the IDF announced. ""In the last 12 hours, the soldiers of the division struck around 50 targets, including combat zones, operational residences, outposts, military positions and underground infrastructure, and eliminated terrorists in close-quarter combat,"" the military said. There are growing tensions along the Israel-Lebanon border as Hezbollah continues to launch rockets from southern Lebanon into Israel. In a recent speech, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah stopped short of announcing an all-out war with Israel, but threatened that the group's actions will depend on developments in Gaza. The main focus of the Israeli military, however, remains on eliminating Hamas. About two dozen soldiers have been killed so far in military operations in Gaza, according to the IDF. The goal to remove Hamas is a major military challenge that will likely take two to six months, according to Yaacov Amidror, the former general and national security adviser in Israel. Zur, the woman who attended a memorial event for the kidnapped Israelis, said her grandson is among those fighting in Gaza. ""I'm terribly worried. His mother, my daughter is broken. I mean, she's so worried and we don't know what's going on,"" she said. Taking full control of the Hamas-controlled enclave may be the easy part. Finding a viable replacement to take over running Gaza, is another thing entirely. Israel doesn't want to do it, Amidror said. ""We don't want to take responsibility for 2 million Palestinians to rebuild Gaza,"" he said. Right now, there is no clear candidate on what entity or government could potentially take on such a monumental task. ",npr_articles/article_258.txt,npr_results/article_258.txt.json
259,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/11/05/1209976575/israel-hamas-war-hope-empathy-personal-stories,"Maoz Inon no longer sleeps well at night. His loss is too great. So first thing every morning, for 45 minutes, he swims in the Mediterranean, off the Israeli shore — to find a few moments of peace. ""Great sea life — fish, manta rays,"" says Inon. ""It's really surprising, beautiful swimming. Just to know that I'm doing something for my body and for my soul. ""But once Inon is back ashore, the events of Oct. 7 come tumbling back into his mind. The morning of the Hamas attack, Inon's parents were at home in their community of Netiv HaAsara, a mere quarter-mile from Gaza. ""I called, and my dad said he and Mom are in the safe room. And there are a lot of sirens and alarms and shooting,"" Inon recalls. When he saw the news about what was happening, he called his father back about five minutes later. ""And this time there was no answer,"" he says. ""And this was the last time we heard from them. ""Inon's father was 78 and an expert agronomist. His mother would have turned 76 this week. She was a retired schoolteacher and an artist. That morning, Inon says, a Hamas fighter launched a rocket-propelled grenade that directly hit his parents' wooden house. ""The security guy of the community told us that my parents' house is burned to ashes and there are two bodies inside,"" he says. Some of Inon's family in Israel gathered in person. They called his brother in London and their children. ""[With] the group together, we told them,"" he says, his voice quivering. For much of the time since then, Inon says it has felt like he's swimming in an ocean of sorrow. ""When you are swimming in the ocean,"" he explains, ""you don't understand how big it is. You don't see the end, you don't see the bottom. So that's how big it is — more than you can understand. ""And yet, amid this sea of grief that he's cratered into, Inon says he feels no urge for revenge. And when he cries, somehow the tears aren't for his parents. ""I was crying, and I'm still crying, for all the innocent victims from both sides that will die,"" he says. ""And I'm crying for this 100 years of bloodshed, of cycle of death. ""Inon says that this cycle can seem endless, but he has hope. ""It seems like there is no solution,"" he says, ""but there is. ""Not everyone who has suffered a horrific loss responds like Inon. Oded Adomi Leshem, a political psychologist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, cautions that it's important to be realistic about people's potential for empathy when the trauma is still so fresh. ""We need to be very sensitive [to] the current developments in the region,"" he says. ""We are in the midst of the fighting. We're in the midst of war. People are going to funerals. People are burying their loved ones as we talk right now. ""Even before the war began, Palestinians and Israeli Jews had mixed feelings about the future. A 2023 Pew Research Center survey found growing pessimism among both Israeli Jews and Palestinian citizens of Israel for a two-state solution (i. e. , an independent Jewish state and an independent Palestinian state coexisting peacefully alongside one another). Just 35% thought it was possible, down from 44% in 2017 and 50% in 2013. But in one of Leshem's research studies, he shows that Jewish Israelis and Palestinians consistently underestimate the other group's hope for peace. In addition, he says, ""this underestimation actually reduces one's own hope. ""Still, Leshem says his research has found that most people think and want the same thing. ""Most Jewish Israelis and most Palestinians,"" he says, ""want to live peacefully between the [Jordan] River and the [Mediterranean] Sea in some form of coexistence when there is safety for all the people. ""In support of that argument, in an article in Foreign Affairs, two authors affiliated with Arab Barometer, a nonpartisan group that evaluates public opinion across the Arab world, point out that in a survey of Palestinians days before the war began, ""73% of Gazans favored a peaceful settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. "" And two-thirds of those surveyed expressed little or no trust in Hamas. Leshem also says that even a glimmer of hope can make a difference when things are at their bleakest. ""Think about a small flame of a candle,"" he suggests. ""If the room is lit with daylight, then the light from this small candle doesn't really influence anything. But when the room is dark, then suddenly the light of the candle has some meaning. ""In the aftermath of Hamas' early morning attack on Oct. 7 and Israel's subsequent military response, many communities in southern Israel were evacuated for their safety, including those that had been directly attacked. The group Physicians for Human Rights-Israel arranged to send its mobile clinic to help some of the evacuees staying at a hotel near the Dead Sea. Dr. Lina Qasem Hassan had to make a difficult choice. She's an Arab citizen of Israel (i. e. , a member of the country's Palestinian community) and she had to decide whether she wanted to join that mobile clinic. ""It's not easy as a Palestinian to do this,"" she says. ""But I felt that it's my duty also to be with these people. ""For her, the war has been a test of her compassion. Most days, Qasem Hassan works as a family physician near Haifa in Israel, treating Jewish patients. ""I have this human relationship with [my patients],"" she says, ""because I treated them for so many years. They respect the way I think and I respect the way they think. I can find inside myself this part that can really be empathic to the place they come from, the pain they represent. ""For most of her life, she'd never even set foot in Gaza. Then, a few years ago, she began traveling to Gaza every other month with that same mobile clinic and a team of Arab citizens of Israel — volunteer doctors, surgeons and psychologists — to provide free health care to Palestinians. ""To visit Gaza,"" she says, ""it's not easy because you see poverty and hunger. And even the medical problems of the children that we see there on other ordinary days — not on days of attacks — are actually anemia and failure to thrive, underweight children. ""But she also saw families doing ordinary things — strolling the streets, buying ice cream for their kids. On one of her first visits to Gaza, she met some of her extended family, including Marwan Abu Reda — her sister-in-law's brother. He was an ambulance driver living in southern Gaza. He hadn't seen his sister and mother, now living in Israel near Qasem Hassan, in decades. It was summer, and so Abu Reda took Qasem Hassan to the beach. In a different universe, she says, it could have been a riviera. ""I could see the people, in regular days, how much the sea is important for them,"" she says. ""If they didn't have the sea, they could die — really. Because they have no place to go. It's a very big prison, that was the feeling. And the only place that they can see a little bit far is the sea. ""On the day of the attack, Qasem Hassan heard shouting outside her home in Israel. It was Abu Reda's sister and mother. They had just learned that he'd been driving his ambulance to rescue people when he was struck by incoming Israeli shelling. ""He died actually without seeing his mother,"" Qasem Hassan says. ""It represents the story of the Palestinian people. ""There's been no mobile clinic traveling from Israel to Gaza since the war began. In the wake of Israel's airstrikes and ground invasion, thousands of Palestinians have perished and the wounded have overfilled Gaza's beleaguered hospitals. ""I am the first one to call for the freedom of the Palestinian people and to end the occupation,"" Qasem Hassan says. ""But I don't agree with what happened with the Hamas attack. My feeling was the pain of humans doesn't differ. It's not different if you are actually Israeli or Palestinian or American. It's the same pain. ""This is what helped motivate her to accompany the mobile clinic to work with the Israeli Jewish evacuees. When Qasem Hassan walked into the hotel, she says it looked like a refugee camp. People were scattered everywhere. There were stacks of donated clothing. She talked to the evacuees who were from Kibbutz Be'eri, a community of 4,000 people not quite 3 miles from Gaza, and heard their horrific stories. ""They told me how they have been hiding for 20 hours,"" she recalls. ""Old people without their medicine, without food, without water, all the family hiding in one room. They were very afraid, very worried about their own lives and the lives of their children. "" She met one old man with Parkinson's disease who, since the attack, could no longer walk. As she listened and looked, Qasem Hassan kept seeing flickers in her imagination of the evacuees' Palestinian counterparts just a few miles away — displaced, injured, in shock. It was a kind of split vision. Then, the secretary of the kibbutz began reading the long list of names of those from their community who'd died or been kidnapped. ""I was accompanied by a feeling, like, at least these people have names,"" she says, ""and have somebody to put them in a list and give them clothes when their houses are destroyed. And I couldn't keep out of mind this thought that these people that are killed now in Gaza, nobody is even knowing their names. It's very difficult for me. ""In the weeks since her time with the evacuees, Qasem Hassan says that each night when she learns about the latest devastation in Gaza, she cries. ""I try to hide this from my daughters [who are 7 and 10] because I don't want them to see all these disasters going on. I'm very, very sad and I want to help but I can't help. ""She's finding it harder and harder to sit on the sidelines. She wants to travel to Gaza to help the injured. ""Every day I pray that somebody lets us get in. We are just praying that the borders will be open and we can go and help. ""Today's war between Israel and Hamas is stirring up painful memories for those who've suffered profound personal losses in previous cycles of this same conflict. In early 2002, Robi Damelin recalls a sense of dread falling over her. It was during the Second Intifada, a massive uprising in the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza. Damelin's son David — who'd already served his mandatory time in the Israeli army — was called up for reserve duty in the West Bank. At the time, David was a master's student at Tel Aviv University who enjoyed cooking with his mother and playing the French horn. ""He was part of the peace movement,"" says Damelin, ""and he didn't want to serve in the Occupied Territories. "" But he came to his mother and said that if he went, he would treat the Palestinians with dignity — something he could impress upon the soldiers he was commanding. ""I really didn't want him to go,"" says Damelin. But David went anyway. On March 3, 2002, at a checkpoint, a Palestinian sniper killed David and nine others. ""When the army came to tell me that David had been killed by a Palestinian,"" Damelin recalls, ""one of the first things that I said is: 'You can't kill anybody in the name of my child. ' ""Damelin says she knew fairly quickly that she wanted to do something to prevent other mothers — both Palestinian and Israeli — from experiencing the pain she was now feeling. ""I understood that that would be the rest of my life,"" she says. ""My whole sense of priorities changed. ""She joined the Parents Circle — Families Forum, a bereavement group for Israelis and Palestinians who've lost a close family member to the ongoing conflict. ""I remember sitting around the table and looking into the eyes of the Palestinian mothers and recognizing that we shared the same pain. ""Damelin started traveling with a Palestinian partner on behalf of the group and speaking about their shared grief. They spoke at the House of Lords in the U. K. , the U. S. Senate and even a concert in San Francisco by Michael Franti, a rapper known for his social and political stands. Then, 2 1/2 years after David's death, one evening while she was back home in Tel Aviv sitting in front of her computer, there was a knock. When Damelin saw three soldiers standing before her, she slammed the door because she didn't want to confront what she feared they were about to tell her. But they kept knocking. She finally opened the door again. ""And they said, 'We caught the man who killed David. ' ""It was a test of her compassion. Did she mean what she'd been saying to all those people? ""Now there's a face,"" she says. It took her three months, but Damelin finally wrote a letter to the family of the sniper. ""This for me is one of the most difficult letters I will ever have to write,"" it began. She told them about the Parents Circle and the need for some kind of reconciliation process. She told them about David. ""And I then told them that I thought we should meet because we owed that to our children and grandchildren,"" she says. The sniper's family delivered Damelin's letter to the sniper in prison. It took three years before he sent her a reply. ""And in it,"" Damelin says, ""he told me that I'm crazy and that I should stay away from his family and that he killed 10 people to free Palestine. ""But those words didn't sway her. ""You see, I knew that when he was a very small child, he saw his uncle violently killed by the Israeli army,"" she explains. ""And then in the Second Intifada, he lost two further uncles. "" She saw why he'd killed her son — out of revenge — and somehow, she forgave him. Damelin grew up in South Africa during the anti-apartheid movement. Later, after David died, she returned to South Africa for a visit and met a woman whose daughter had been killed in the country's conflict. This woman had managed to forgive the people who'd killed her daughter. ""And then I met the man who actually sent the people who killed her daughter,"" she says. ""And he said, 'By her forgiving me, she released me from the prison of my inhumanity. ' ""Today, Damelin is director of international relations for the Parents Circle. She's helped organize dialogues between Palestinian and Israeli teenagers. ""It's probably the first time that these kids ever had an opportunity to listen to a story of transformation,"" she says, ""and to be able to ask the most difficult of questions. "" These questions include: Why do you teach your children to hate? What would you do if you met the soldier who killed your loved one? How do you see Hamas and other similar movements? What is Palestine?Damelin has also helped run a summer camp for bereaved Palestinian and Israeli teens. One of her own grandchildren attended and told her, ""This is the best week that I've ever spent in my life. """"This experience of being able to understand who's on the other side is quite extraordinary,"" she says. ""When you begin to know somebody and they trust you, you can actually talk. ""Damelin isn't sure how these programs and her efforts will fare in light of the current conflict. ""There is no such thing as instant reconciliation,"" says Damelin. ""We have to be very patient. This is still a war. Nobody knows where things are going. ""Political psychologist Leshem agrees, and says that the timing of when to reach across this chasm of anguish is critical. ""When the flames of war subside a little bit,"" he says, ""then understanding what the other side thinks is very important. ""But Damelin knows the damage for today's Israeli and Palestinian children and young people will be profound. ""What kind of adults are going to come out of this?"" she asks. ""I'm terrified of all the retribution that's going to happen because people think that you can get revenge. There's no revenge. Revenge only creates more violence. ""Yousef Bashir has a permanent physical reminder of the stakes of the long-running conflict between Israel and Gaza — a bullet lodged in his spine. Bashir grew up in Gaza. In 2000, during the Second Intifada, when he was 11, Israeli soldiers occupied the second and third floors of his family home. As for why they did so, ""the short answer is because they could,"" Bashir says. The house was isolated from the rest of the neighborhood and it gave the soldiers a lookout that let them ""see all the way to the sea. ""The soldiers ""demolished our greenhouses,"" he says, ""and pretty much every night, moved the entire family to sleep in the living room while they controlled the rest of the house. ""Bashir says he had to ask the soldiers for permission to use the bathroom. In the face of that difficult time, Bashir recalls his father explaining that ""we should not allow them to turn us into hateful, vengeful people. I've watched my dad insist that the only way forward for both sides is peace. And it isn't only just because it is the right thing to do, but if we are to move forward and become doctors and engineers and husbands and fathers and productive members of the international community, we must do all we can to preserve our humanity. ""His father drew on the Quran. ""Never let hatred for any people lead you to deviate from being just to them,"" he quoted in Arabic. Bashir says his father told him ""it is one thing to lose one's home and one's land and even a loved one. But it is another thing — the most tragic thing — when one loses their humanity. ""It wasn't always easy for Bashir to agree with his father. For instance, one summer, the soldiers prevented Bashir and his family from going to the beach, which was 15 minutes away. Bashir snapped. But his father said to him, ""imagine you are at the beach, imagine the air, the breeze, the waves, the ocean, the sand, imagine, imagine what would you be doing?"" Bashir couldn't quite put himself on the shore in his mind that day, but ever since he's practiced his ability to imagine. And it's helped him imagine a different reality for himself and his people to this day. Peace and tolerance are the core lessons that Bashir was taught as a boy — ""as a person, as a Muslim, as an Arab, as a Palestinian,"" he says. ""I became peaceful in Gaza. I became peaceful when my house was besieged and when my family was shot at, when my farms were demolished. And I think that is a miracle. ""Without those important lessons, Bashir isn't sure whether he would have survived his youth. ""My dad saved my life,"" he says. Roughly a week after he turned 15 years old, just outside his home, a soldier fired the bullet that embedded itself in the center of Bashir's back, in his spine. ""I was lucky to survive,"" he says. ""I collapsed to the ground. I was looking to figure out what was happening because I felt no pain. I saw no blood, but I could not speak and I definitely could not feel my legs. """"I think I was shot only because I was Palestinian,"" he reflects. ""Quite frankly,"" he admits, ""I did want to die because it was not normal for a child to be subjected to that way of living. But at the same time, I'm just 15. Why should I go now?""Bashir was rushed to a hospital in Tel HaShomer, Israel. Up until that point, he'd only met Israeli settlers and soldiers. But now he was meeting Israeli doctors trying to repair him. ""I don't think Israel intended to show me their human side,"" Bashir says. ""But I think some higher power wanted me to see that. "" He recalls an Israeli nurse who frequently rushed to his side, explaining to some of the other health workers that he was shot for no justifiable reason. All this made Bashir understand his father's perspective better. He also came to recognize that he's from a very particular part of the world. ""I come from the Holy Land,"" he says. ""The land of Jesus and Muhammad and Moses, the [land of the] Jews, Christians and Muslims. ""Bashir was in a wheelchair for two years, but he did learn to walk again. He still does physical therapy and takes regular shots of cortisone to relieve the pain. Today, half his lifetime later, 34-year-old Bashir lives in Washington, D. C. . where he's finishing his Ph. D. in international affairs at Johns Hopkins University. The residual bullet causes him ongoing discomfort — ""a 24/7 ordeal for me,"" he says. ""When I watch movies, when I hang out, when I sleep, when I play, when I do just about anything. ""To Bashir, it's a constant reminder of the conflict — and why the fighting must stop. ""I am here,"" he says. ""I still believe. I'm still committed. Despite the pain that I will experience tomorrow, I am convinced that [peace is] the only way forward. ""The present moment, however, is a difficult test of Bashir's conviction. ""With every image, with every video, with every report I see of innocent Palestinians being killed and targeted,"" he says, ""I get very close to screaming in my apartment. And breaking. "" Bashir's voice cracks. And then he remembers his father who insisted on peace. ""It's bad enough,"" says Bashir. ""My people lack freedom and a state and so much more. I think to be deprived of [our humanity] is just unacceptable. And so in preserving my humanity, in my mind, I am somehow still giving my people and the world a chance for a better life. ""The right to live in peace and security, Bashir argues, ""belongs to the Palestinians just as much as it belongs to the Israelis. ""Maoz Inon — who swims every morning to keep from drowning in grief — says he's experienced this other reality of peace. He and his wife opened a guesthouse in Nazareth in 2005 that serves both Israeli Jews and Palestinians. And he's seen these two groups ""not living next to each other but living among each other based on equality"" in what Inon calls a shared society. ""I have partners and friends in the Palestine territories, in Jordan, in Egypt,"" he says. ""And I know that they are also sharing with me the thoughts that peace is achievable. ""It's a peace, he says, that must start with an immediate cease-fire. And unlike conflict, which political psychologist Leshem says is bloody but familiar to Israelis and Palestinians, hope is different. It's unfamiliar and unpredictable. ""If we kind of accept this unpredictability,"" he says, ""take the chance [on] this uncertain thing — which is called peace between the [Jordan] River and the [Mediterranean] Sea — then this is closely related to hope. ""Inon says he had something of a vision after this war began. It was the middle of the night, and he awoke in tears. ""And I saw an image of everyone crying,"" he recalls. ""Just we all cry — you cry, your daughter cry, everyone. And our tears are healing the wounds from Israelis and Palestinians. And our tears wash the blood. ""He says we shouldn't have more weapons, build higher walls and create better security systems. ""That's the old world, OK? You want to start a new world? We need to cry.

260,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/04/1210669096/palestine-march-washington-dc-cease-fire-israel-protest-gaza,"At least tens of thousands of people gathered in the nation's capital on Saturday for one of the biggest pro-Palestinian protests in the U. S. since the Israeli bombardment of Gaza began in response to the attack by Hamas militants last month. Protesters are pushing for a cease-fire in Gaza, where health officials say thousands of Palestinians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes. The event, organized by several pro-Palestinian groups, began with an afternoon rally at Freedom Plaza, before crowds began a march in a loop past the White House a few blocks away. At the rally, speakers' chants and messaging centered on calls to end U. S. funding for Israel in the war, accusing President Biden of backing a ""genocide"" of Palestinian people. Nour Jaghama, a Palestinian organizer for the anti-war organization Code Pink, asked the crowd: ""Why we can hear these words and firsthand accounts from Gaza yet the genocide still continues? Why do only 18 representatives and only one senator support a cease-fire?""At Saturday's rally, protesters held a moment of silence for those killed in Israel's response offensive. More than 9,480 Palestinians have been killed by Israel's military attacks over the last four weeks, according to Gaza's health ministry. Israel has tightened its siege on Gaza City in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, the focus of its expanded ground offensive in its stated campaign to defeat Hamas after the militant group carried out attacks on Israeli communities on Oct. 7 that killed about 1,400 people. The event drew supporters from cities across the country, selling out bus seats for many departure points including Portland, Maine; Boston; Columbus, Ohio; Miami; and at least 10 buses from New York City. Younass Barkouch, 24, came from Jersey City, N. J. , to attend the march. He said that while his family comes from Morocco, he is protesting first and foremost as an American. ""I was raised to believe that the United States condemned atrocities, war crimes, heinous government acts wherever they saw them. Regardless of who committed them,"" he said. He believes Israel's response has been disproportionate. He wants a cease-fire and for mediators to come together to resolve the conflict. Ammara Rana, 39, grew up in Maryland. As a Muslim herself, she said, it was emotional to see the show of solidarity for a Muslim-majority people. ""The unity is amazing — to see so many Americans come out — and I hope Joe Biden sees what he's losing,"" Rana said. ""He's going to lose the vote if he doesn't do anything to stop this. """"We all voted for him for equality,"" she continued. ""And if he doesn't give everybody that right, then he's hopefully not going to be our next president. "" Pedro Kremer, 48, was raised Jewish in Argentina and now lives outside D. C. He says he was taught that Jews seek justice ""everywhere and for everyone. """"What is happening right now is the farthest that justice can be,"" he said. His stance, questioning Israel's leadership, has created a rift between family and friends, he says — even his best friend, who called him antisemitic. Kremer, who pushed his baby in a stroller during the march, said there's no difference between the value of his son's life or that of a child living in Gaza. All attendees NPR spoke to at the march expressed support for a cease-fire. U. S. officials have so far stopped short of demands for a cease-fire, but pressed Israel on Friday for a ""humanitarian pause"" in its military offensive to allow more aid to enter Gaza and for the release of the more than 200 hostages being held by Hamas. Israel rejected such a pause, saying any sort of cease-fire is contingent on the release of hostages. Later Friday, an Israeli airstrike had hit an ambulance near Al Shifa, a main hospital in Gaza. Palestinians said more than a dozen people were killed in the strike; Israel's military said the target of the bombing was Hamas, whose members Israel says have been using sensitive sites for cover. The U. S. has given billions in military aid to Israel for years. President Biden last month asked Congress for more than $14 billion in military aid for Israel.

261,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/04/1210645183/israeli-military-announces-brief-window-people-in-northern-gaza-to-flee-south,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel's military said Hamas attacked a safe passageway from northern Gaza during a three-hour evacuation window it had set on Saturday. ""The Hamas terrorist organization exploited the humanitarian window that the IDF provided to residents of the Gaza Strip to move southwards, and the terrorists fired mortars and anti-tank missiles at IDF troops who arrived and operated to open the route,"" the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. Earlier Saturday, the military announced there would be a brief three-hour window (starting 1 p. m. local time until 4 p. m. ) for people trapped in northern Gaza to travel on the road to southern Gaza safely. The Israeli military said it would ""avoid hitting"" a main road heading south, but emphasized that this was in no way a cease-fire. Hundreds of thousands of people still stuck in northern Gaza had three hours to flee south. But it appears few people, if any, were able to leave. By the end of this window, an NPR reporter in Gaza had not encountered anyone able to use this so-called safe passage. Several drivers there shared that it was impossible for anyone to make it through on the damaged street. One driver told NPR that he and his brother were heading south and found that the roads were not passable, that ""there are holes in the ground, and we saw body parts strewn all over Salah al-Din,"" the main highway in the Gaza Strip. He said they ""were afraid to keep going because we heard shooting beyond the valley so we came back. "" This person asked NPR not to use their name out of concern for their safety. Salama Maarouf, Hamas' head of government media office, called the passageway ""a big lie in order to target citizens. ""He continued, ""The Salah al-Din Road is not valid for cars to pass due to its bulldozing and the stationing of occupation vehicles. ""The United Nations estimates that there could be as many 300,000 internally displaced people still stuck in northern Gaza, including Gaza City — an area Israeli forces have surrounded as part of their ground operation. It's been about a week since Israeli troops pushed into Gaza through a ground offensive and remained in the Strip. This military effort has mostly been focused in the north and has effectively cut the strip in half, preventing aid from getting in or civilians from getting out. The Palestinian death toll from Israel's response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack is now at 9,488 people in Gaza — nearly 70% of them being women and children, according to the Ministry of Health. If any civilians were able to flee to the south of Gaza during the window, they could likely move no further than that once they arrived. Officials in Gaza also closed the one available border crossing from Gaza into Egypt on Saturday. They said foreign passport holders will not be allowed to leave Gaza through the Rafah border crossing into Egypt unless patients from the hospitals in Gaza City and northern Gaza are permitted to get to the crossing. The crossing has been opened the past three days for Palestinians with foreign nationalities, or Palestinians with connections to foreign countries and foreign employers. The list of people approved to leave Gaza on Saturday — in what would have been the fourth day for the border to be open — included more Americans. U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken continued to negotiate with the heads of governments of several Middle Eastern countries this weekend following his Friday visit to Israel. During his talks with Israeli officials, he pushed the U. S. line that Israel should agree to a ""humanitarian pause"" to allow more aid to enter Gaza and for hostages to be released. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the idea. The U. S. has not called for a full cease-fire. In Jordan on Saturday, Blinken met with leaders and senior officials from Egypt, Qatar, Jordan and Lebanon. The Arab leaders urged an immediate cease-fire. Blinken said a cease-fire at this point would be counterproductive and allow Hamas to continue its deadly attacks in the future. Blinken also now plans a stop in Turkey on Monday just as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan strongly criticized Israel and Netanyahu this weekend. Erdogan split with other NATO nations and said Turkey will not support any resolution to the Israel-Hamas war that includes ""gradually erasing Palestinians. ""Erdogan has said he supports a two-state solution and has called for a cease-fire. NPR's Anas Baba contributed reporting from Gaza.

262,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/04/1210588361/israel-palestinian-workers-construction-economy,"TEL AVIV, Israel — The construction site, like so many others in Israel, is frozen in time. Just outside of downtown Tel Aviv, the half-built apartment building has been empty for almost a month: conduits of wires hanging loose from the ceiling, piles of unused rebar rusting, water collecting in dirt around the foundation. Normally, there would be 20 or 25 workers here, said project manager Bashar Jabareen, a Palestinian citizen of Israel. But on this day in early November, there are only himself and a couple of others there only to keep an eye on the site and make sure nobody has broken in. Like most construction projects across Israel, work on these apartments has been on pause since Oct. 7, the day thousands of fighters from the Gaza-based militant group Hamas poured across the border into Israel, where they killed about 1,400 people and kidnapped hundreds of others. Since then, as Israel has mounted a military campaign on Gaza in response, Israeli authorities have indefinitely paused worker permits for Palestinians over security concerns, hitting both Israeli industry and the West Bank's economy. In peacetime, more than 110,000 Palestinians held permits to work in Israel or Israeli settlements, according to Palestinian officials, the majority of them in the construction industry. Left without those workers — and without alternative sources of labor, as Israeli reservists have been called to war and many foreign workers have fled the conflict — the construction industry in Israel is operating at 15% of its prewar capacity, according to the Israel Builders Association, an industry group. ""It's a very, very big problem for the Israeli economy,"" said Shay Pauzner, the association's deputy director-general. ""This is one of the places where every Israeli will feel the impact of this war: in his pocket. ""And for Palestinians in the West Bank, the sudden shutoff of income has rippled through the economy, as workers struggle to pay their rent, car payments and children's tuition. The longer it goes on, workers say, the more desperate their situations will become. Both Israelis and Palestinians agreed that the current situation has no comparison to other hostilities between Israel and Hamas in recent years, when the worker permits returned relatively quickly. Perhaps it could be two to three months before the workers could return, employers and workers told NPR; perhaps it could be never. ""Nobody knows what's going to happen,"" Pauzner said. A handyman for a monastery in west Jerusalem told NPR he was likely to be replaced if he missed much more work. A metalworker for construction sites in Israel said he was relieved he had paid his daughter's tuition before the war began — if the war lasts too much longer, he said, his family will become lower class. Like many workers with Israeli permits, construction worker Raed said he chose to work for Israeli employers because the salary is higher. (Palestinian workers in the West Bank gave NPR only their first names due to concerns that Israel could deny them a work permit in the future. )His Israeli employer pays him 200 to 250 shekels each day, or about $50 to $65, to pour concrete for new homes at an Israeli settlement nearby. But Raed has been unable to return since Oct. 7, not even to collect his wages from last month. Now, he has no income, he said, with a wife and two small children to feed. ""What can I do? Nobody knows if we're going to go back or not,"" Raed said. ""On a financial level, I am destroyed. I don't know how to provide for my family. ""About 13% of all employed Palestinians worked in Israel or Israeli settlements before the war, according to the International Monetary Fund. In addition to construction, many worked in agriculture or the service sector. Yet even those who didn't work in Israel have felt the impact of the permit cutoff. At a small grocery store near Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, the store owner, Nasser, constantly watches news about the war as he mans the checkout counter. In normal times, he allows regular customers to buy groceries on credit as needed. But since the war began, the number of customers asking to make purchases on credit has gone up fivefold, Nasser told NPR, and the amount of money they owe has risen, too. ""When those who work in Israel put their money here, they move the economy,"" said Mahmoud, an electrician. ""But if no one is working in Israel, then we don't get any money here. Everything stops. We're turning on the same wheel. ""Mahmoud doesn't work for Israelis, he said, instead preferring to work for Palestinian employers around the West Bank. That has become more difficult in the war, too: Israel has closed roads and checkpoints across the West Bank, making it hard to know how long it will take to commute to a job — or if it will even be possible to do so. But his biggest problem is that few people have the money to pay him anymore. Those that do have savings are holding their money tight, in case the war drags on, he said. Asked if he wanted the war to end so things could get back to normal, he answered yes, but only if victory is on the Palestinians' side, and not with Israel. ""This is a sacrifice for the sake of getting at least part of my rights one day,"" he said. ""And no matter how much I sacrifice, no matter the price, it won't be like what my cousins in Gaza are going through. ""For years, the Palestinian work permit program was seen as a way to improve relations between Israel and Palestinians in the occupied territories. Giving Palestinians steady jobs in Israel with reliable income could divert them from associating with radical militant organizations like Islamic Jihad and Hamas, supporters of the work programs said. ""A person who leaves at five in the morning and returns at seven in the evening has no time for terrorism,"" said Amit Gottlieb, the vice president of Gottlieb Construction, the company whose construction sites near Tel Aviv are paused. ""This is a concept that I too believed in. ""Palestinians had to undergo a security check every few months in order to receive the permits. During previous conflicts between Israel and Hamas, workers from the West Bank were allowed to return to work with minimal disruption. But since Oct. 7, political support in Israel for Palestinian worker permit programs has collapsed. Israel was quick to pull the plug on workers from Gaza; the security cabinet announced last week that ""there will be no more Palestinian workers from Gaza. "" Thousands of permit workers from Gaza who had been stranded in Israel since Oct. 7 were deported Friday. But the chill on worker permits has extended to workers from the West Bank, who had long been seen as safer than those from Gaza, in part because the West Bank is run by the more moderate Palestinian Authority, as opposed to Hamas, which governs Gaza. ""I am against the entry of thousands of workers from the PA who may endanger civilian lives at this time,"" said Itamar Ben Gvir, Israel's national security minister, in a post last month on the social media site X (previously known as Twitter) in response to a proposal to allow 8,000 Palestinian men over the age of 60 and women of any age to return to work on Israeli farms. In Israel, construction demands are significant: Israel's population is growing significantly faster than the worldwide average, and when the war is finished, there will be demand to repair and rebuild homes damaged by the fighting. The events of Oct. 7, in which Hamas fighters broke into Israeli towns and homes to kill and kidnap people, has Israelis on edge, Gottlieb said. ""This situation has made everyone who hears Arabic fear that there are terrorists roaming around,"" he said. Some mayors have asked construction companies to close sites out of security fears, he said. Like almost all Israelis in the construction industry, Gottlieb has worked alongside Palestinians for his entire career. ""We have a personal relationship with them, and even these days, I can say that I love them,"" he said. ""I have employees that I know better than my friends. ""But Oct. 7 has shaken his confidence in the long-term ability of Israelis and Palestinians to work together. The dilemma is with him morning, noon, evening and night, he said. ""Is it their goal to live in cooperation with us or to kill us?"" Gottlieb asked. ""I'm not as sure today as I used to be before Oct. 7.

263,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/03/1210441078/israel-palestinian-gaza-workers-stuck-west-bank,"RAFAH, Gaza Strip, and JERICHO, West Bank — News from Gaza comes in conversations in the hallway, over the communal sinks, between bunk beds, and texts and calls with relatives. For thousands of workers from Gaza who are stuck in makeshift shelters and camps in the West Bank, much of their world — including their families — is still 60 miles away. On Friday, they heard about thousands of other laborers who were forced to return to Gaza on foot from Israel — dropped off several miles from the Israeli border with Gaza, wearing numbered tags on their ankles. Some of those men, after returning to Gaza, told NPR they had been rounded up across Israel by the country's security forces and detained following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, when militants stormed into Israel, killing around 1,400 people and taking an estimated 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials. Israel's Security Cabinet said on Thursday, ""Israel is severing all contact with Gaza. There will be no more Palestinian workers from Gaza. ""Those who are now stuck in the shelters and camps in the West Bank are among many thousands of workers from the Gaza Strip who avoided detention in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. They were able to make their way to the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation. For now, their accommodations are provided by the Palestinian Authority, which has some local control in the West Bank. To return to Gaza, they would have to go through Israel — but they are not allowed to enter. Even if they could, there is no way of knowing how they would get to Gaza. One of the workers taking shelter in the West Bank, Basel Zrain, says he's been separated from his wife and children in northern Gaza for about a month. He may be in the West Bank physically, he says, but ""My heart, my mind are not here. ""Israel's attacks on the Gaza Strip since Oct. 7 have killed more than 9,000 people, 70% of them women and children, according to Palestinian health officials. Nearly 200,000 homes have been destroyed. Before the war with Hamas, Israel gave out more than 18,000 work permits to people from Gaza. Many were employed in restaurants, retail or construction — living in Israel short-term or coming daily, and sending money back home to their families. Days after Oct. 7, Israel revoked those temporary work permits and imposed a total blockade of the Gaza Strip. In the following days, thousands of Palestinian laborers from Gaza went missing or were detained by Israeli police, according to HaMoked, a human rights organization in Israel. At the Al-Istiqlal University campus in the Palestinian city of Jericho, laundry hangs from the windows. There are dorm rooms stacked with bunk beds, and in larger halls, men lounge on mattresses pushed up against the walls, scrolling on their cellphones for news from Gaza. Whatever belongings they have fill plastic bags that dot the floor. There are communal sinks and an impromptu barber shop where you can get a shave and a trim if you join the wait list. It is a makeshift shelter, home to more than 400 workers from Gaza, one of several accommodations throughout the city. Thousands more laborers are taking shelter throughout the West Bank, including in the city of Ramallah. Here, the men sleep in rooms cramped with bunk beds. ""All we want is to go home,"" they say again and again to NPR. One of the Palestinian workers, Ibrahim Alfarany, has been staying at Al-Istiqlal University for more than three weeks. He usually works and lives near a store just south of Tel Aviv, where he stocks vegetables for a few weeks at a time, and travels back to Gaza. While Alfarany was able to take a bus to the West Bank after Oct. 7, his brother was detained by the Israeli military near Nahariya, in northern Israel. After losing contact for more than 20 days, Alfarany finally talked to his brother on Friday, as his brother was walking into Gaza along with thousands of other workers. Alfarany says he is very happy and relieved to know his brother is alive, though the life he and other family members are experiencing in Gaza is hard to watch from afar. His wife and kids survived an Israeli airstrike several weeks ago while seeking cover at a playground. There are no buildings left in his neighborhood on the northern outskirts of Gaza City, he says, and his house was among those destroyed. ""I had a video, but it disturbed me too much that I deleted it,"" he says. ""I watched it four or five times, and then said, 'I'm gonna delete it,' and I did. ""Alfarany has nearly two dozen nieces and nephews and says he gets overwhelmed thinking about all the children going through the trauma of war right now. ""My mental state of mind is destroyed,"" he says. ""I'm in a very bad place right now. ""He scrolls through his phone, looking at photos of his two young daughters, Layan and Razan. Seeing pictures of their smiling faces, before the war, helps him forget all the bad things that have happened, he says. In the courtyard of the university, another worker from Gaza, Basel Zrain, tells NPR even though he and the other men are safe here, with food and water, being away from their children haunts them. His wife and five children are staying in Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital, where the United Nations estimates some 50,000 people are seeking refuge from Israeli strikes. He relishes every text message and every call, even if the news is chilling. ""My son, when I speak with him, I say, 'How are you?' and he tells me, 'Baba, I write my name on my arm, in case I am killed,'"" Zrain says. His son wants people to know who he is when he dies. It's hard to hear stories like that through the phone while being stuck in the West Bank, says Zrain. ""I want to die with my children,"" he says.

264,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/03/1210404916/blinken-israel-hamas-gaza-hezbollah,"Israel has stepped up attacks in northern Gaza amid an ongoing war against Hamas as it spurned U. S. calls for a ""humanitarian pause"" in the Palestinian territory. The Israeli military tightened its siege on Gaza City, as part of its expanded ground operation and continued airstrikes in the region. In the north on Friday afternoon, an Israeli airstrike hit near the front of Al Shifa hospital, the largest hospital in Gaza City, as a convoy of ambulances was transporting seriously injured people to Gaza's southern border for treatment in Egypt, according to the head of the hospital. Israel acknowledged the bombing, but said the target was Hamas militants. The IDF said in a statement that it carried out an airstrike on an ambulance ""being used by a Hamas terrorist cell,"" and that members of Hamas were killed in the strike, but did not give a number. The Israeli military said it has intelligence that Hamas has been using ambulances to transfer operatives and weapons. Dr. Mohammad Abu Salmiya, the director of Al Shifa hospital, said that 13 people were killed and dozens injured in the Israeli strike. Footage of the aftermath showed more than a dozen bloodied bodies of men, women and children lying next to damaged cars and ambulances, the Associated Press reported. The International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement that it had received a request from Gaza's health ministry to accompany the southern-bound convoy evacuating the wounded but did not comment further about the strike near Al Shifa. The humanitarian situation at the hospitals in northern Gaza is ""catastrophic and is getting worse,"" the ICRC added. Earlier in the day, the Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel for another visit to urge the country to prioritize the protection of civilians in Gaza. On Blinken's third visit to the region and fourth to Israel since the outbreak of the war on Oct. 7, he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's war cabinet in Tel Aviv. The U. S. has called for a temporary ""humanitarian pause"" to enable more aid to enter Gaza and for hostages to be released, though Blinken and other U. S. officials have fallen short of a demand for a full cease-fire. ""We provided Israel advice that only the best of friends can offer on how to minimize civilian deaths while still achieving its objectives of finding and finishing Hamas terrorists and their infrastructure of violence,"" Blinken said. In his own remarks, Netanyahu rejected calls for a pause, saying Israel's military forces will continue its operations in Gaza until Hamas is defeated and the kidnapped hostages are returned. Israel's military says Hamas is currently holding 241 hostages. Speaking alongside Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Friday in Tel Aviv and again in a subsequent news conference, Blinken reiterated U. S. solidarity with Israel. ""We stand strongly for the proposition that Israel has not only the right but the obligation to defend itself and to do everything possible to make sure that this Oct. 7 can never happen again,"" Blinken said Friday. But how Israel defends itself matters, he said. ""We've been clear that as Israel conducts its campaign to defeat Hamas, how it does so matters. It matters because it's the right and lawful thing to do. It matters because failure to do so plays into the hands of Hamas and other terror groups,"" Blinken said. Blinken was set to make other visits elsewhere in the Middle East as the leader of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, threatened an escalation of skirmishes with Israel along the border between the two countries. As Blinken addressed the media, Nasrallah spoke for the first time since the war between Israel and Hamas began nearly a month ago. The leader of the Iran-backed group stopped short of announcing an all-out war with Israel, but threatened that the group's actions will depend on developments in Gaza. In his closely watched televised speech, Nasrallah denied that Hezbollah had anything to do with the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel that killed about 1,400 people — or having any knowledge of it beforehand. He celebrated it, however. Nasrallah said in escalating attacks along Lebanon's border with Israel, Hezbollah is intending to draw Israeli firepower away from Gaza. He claimed the operations, which have included shelling attacks, incursions and most recently suicide drones, are tying up significant parts of Israel's military and causing psychological warfare in forcing the displacement of residents in the north of the country. He said the future of this front with Israel hinges in large part on the development of events in Gaza. He called foreign nations, and on the U. S. in particular, to pressure Israel to end the war in Gaza. He warned: ""If you want to avoid a regional war, you must end the aggression on Gaza. ""He said Hezbollah would not be deterred from further military action by threats or by the presence of U. S. warships in the Mediterranean.  ""All scenarios are open on our Lebanese southern front. All options are laid out and we can adopt any at any point in time,"" he said. Netanyahu had his own threats for Hezbollah, saying an attack from Lebanon ""will come at a price. ""In a televised press briefing on Friday, IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said forces carried out a strike on Hezbollah anti-tank firing positions and a Hezbollah military post in response to the firing of an anti-tank missile earlier in the day from the Lebanese side. ""We will act with determination on the northern border against any threat to the State of Israel,"" Hagari said. Israel says that Hamas intentionally operates near sensitive sites. Palestinians say the Israeli air campaign is reckless and has killed thousands of civilians. The U. N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said between Wednesday 12 p. m. and Thursday 2 p. m. , there were 256 Palestinians killed in Gaza. The Palestinian health officials said 9,155 people have died in Gaza since the start of the war. Two-thirds of those victims are children and women, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. Israel reports a death toll of about 1,400 since Oct. 7. On Thursday, two Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza, ""bringing the total number of soldiers killed since the start of ground operations to 17,"" the U. N. said.  On Thursday, 102 trucks carrying humanitarian aid entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing, bringing the total number of trucks that have entered to 374, the U. N. said. They have brought in much-needed medical and food assistance, but Israel continues to block the delivery of fuel, a major problem for Gaza's hospitals.  Despite mounting international criticism on Israel's response to the Oct. 7 attacks, Herzog sought to defend the country, claiming Israel has followed international law in its reaction. Herzog said Gaza citizens are receiving millions of leaflets, text messages and phone calls to alert them in advance of airstrikes and to warn them to leave the area he claimed in accordance with international law. As Herzog and Blinken made their remarks, the families of hostages demonstrating outside could be heard demanding the return of their loved ones, of which there are many Israelis and Americans. ""We are hearing from the outside the demonstration of the families, our heart goes out to them, we understand it, we want her immediate release,"" Herzog said.

265,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/03/1210390398/a-lucky-few-are-leaving-gaza-ohers-are-forced-to-return,"JERUSALEM — We are co-hosting the program from different locations this week, to hear different perspectives on the Mideast war. On Monday, we were in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, where Hamas rockets sometimes strike. On Wednesday, we reported from Ramallah, on the occupied West Bank. Today, we are in Jerusalem, which Israel claims as its capital, though the city's status, like so much else, is disputed. From each location, we have turned toward the war zone in Gaza. As this week ends, we can report that some people are getting out — and some are being sent in. NPR's Daniel Estrin has been following this all night. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity. STEVE INSKEEP: We should just reset the map for people: Israel has blocked the land exits from Gaza. They are the dominant power on three sides. That leaves a crossing on a little bit of border with Egypt. What's happening there?DANIEL ESTRIN: That is Gaza's only portal right now to the outside world, and Egypt has opened that portal, its border crossing, today for a third day in a row. The vast majority of Gazans will not get to cross and not get to leave. This is only open to the lucky few. A few 100 in Gaza are being allowed to leave every day: international aid workers, Palestinians with foreign nationalities, or Palestinians with connections to foreign countries and foreign employers. Our colleague NPR producer Anas Baba has been there on the ground, at the border crossing, every day that it's been open. Here's what he told me he saw on the first day:BABA: ""It was totally unbelievable. There was only a list that holds 400 names. We witnessed at least 1,500 people just struggling and begging for anyone just to make the crossing to save their own lives. ""INSKEEP: That's a very real concern, since Israel's bombardment continues. So who decides who gets on the list, Daniel? ESTRIN: Well, there's a daily list published of who gets to travel that day. It's published every night. It's posted on Facebook by the Hamas-run administration in Gaza. But you can see the Hebrew word ""unclassified"" at the top. So it appears that Israel is vetting the names here. Yesterday, Palestinian-Americans appeared on this list for the very first time. When our producer went there to see them at the border; he described scenes that are just excruciating: People leaving someone behind, families torn apart. He met an eight year old boy from New Jersey who was visiting his grandparents in Gaza when this war broke out. Now he was getting to go back home, but leaving his grandparents behind. Here is our producer Anas Baba speaking to that eight year old, Iyad Okal.  BABA: ""What do you want to say to all the children around the world about Gaza?""IYAD OKAL: ""That they need to get out of Palestine as soon as possible. ""ESTRIN: He also met Wafa Elsaka, who moved to America years ago. She lives in Tallahassee, Florida. We've been following her story throughout the war. And she finally appeared on the list to be able to go. WAFA ELSAKA [crying]: ""It's a mixed feeling, of leaving behind my loved ones, my dad, my mom, my family, but I have to go to my other family, my husband, my son, my grandson. I think God has his point. I don't know what it is. But this is the taxes [price] of going abroad, I guess. Get education and look for a better life. So it's not that I'm sad, I'm not sad. I'm thankful I'm able to go back home. ""ESTRIN: And when she returns to the U. S. ?ELSAKA: ""I'm gonna take a long shower, a long bath, because for the past 25 days, I didn't take any, and then be with my family. Love them more and more. And just pray. I told God to take care of the rest of my family because I can't do anything anymore. ""ESTRIN: Now today's list was published around 2:30am here. Nearly 600 people are on that list: more Palestinian Americans, people from other countries. Anas Baba went back to the border, met a pharmacist, Sam Salouha. He was sending away his young kids, and he's staying behind to take care of his ill dad. And here is what he wants people listening to his voice to know. SALOUHA: ""I want you to be lucky, and cherish everything. When you go to the bathroom and flush you know, cherish that moment, because we don't have that option. If you need bread and if you use a microwave, you are lucky to have that option. ""INSKEEP: Some of the voices of people getting out of Gaza. But Daniel, as you've underlined, most people stay in. What does Gaza look like now?ESTRIN: Well, as of last night, the Israeli army says its troops are now surrounding Gaza City, where Israel says Hamas is headquartered. There are still civilians. They're trapped in that besieged city, people I've spoken to and some who are even meant to be traveling out of Gaza today, but it's very dangerous to get out from that city. I should tell you about something else extraordinary, Steve. People, a few 100 people, are being allowed to escape the war zone today. But Israel is sending in to Gaza thousands of people into that war zone for the very first time. Thousands of Gaza laborers who were working in Israel when the war broke out. They were rounded up by Israel, detained, and our producers saw throngs of them. Thousands, walking into Gaza by foot. They were dropped off by an Israeli bus. One of them was even wearing a bright orange Israeli prison jumpsuit. INSKEEP: Wow. ESTRIN: This is a video that our producer filmed. He saw him walking into Gaza, saying, ""I'm coming from death and I'm going to death. "" And last night, Israel's security cabinet announced that it's severing all contact with Gaza. Israel is sending home all those Gazan workers who were trapped in Israel on the day of the war. Editor's note: Abood Okal and his wife Wafaa Abuzayda, who were featured in a different segment on Morning Edition, managed to cross the border to Egypt on Thursday. They've been through numerous attempts, and their attorney has released a statement stating they are exhausted and worried about their family members remaining in Gaza.

266,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/03/1210326996/one-week-into-israels-ground-war-in-gaza-satellites-and-socialf-media-give-hints,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the country's military leadership have been tight-lipped about Israel's push into the Gaza Strip. But one week into the ground operation, satellite imagery and social media posts are providing some clues about where Israeli forces are moving, and about the overall strategy of their campaign — whose goal, officials say, is destroying Hamas. NPR examined available satellite images, as well as social media posts from both bystanders and the Israel Defense Forces. Based on those images and conversations with military experts, here's what can be gleaned about the operation so far. Israeli forces appear to be at the edge of Gaza City along three axes: two from the north, which are pushing down toward the city itself, and one from the southeast that has moved across the entire Gaza Strip. It's that third axis south of Gaza City that appears to have covered the most ground in the first week. Eyewitness video posted to X, formerly known as Twitter, on Oct. 30 showed what appears to be an Israeli tank engaging a civilian vehicle on one of the main north-south roads between Gaza City and the southern parts of the strip. High-resolution satellite imagery taken by the company Planet on Oct. 31 shows roughly two-dozen Israeli armored vehicles stationed near the road, presumably to control access. A second satellite image from a European Space Agency satellite taken on Nov. 1 showed evidence that Israeli armor had advanced to within three-quarters of a mile (a little over a kilometer) of the coast. Eyewitness videos also appeared to document heavy fighting in the neighborhood of Tal Al Hawa, on the southern end of Gaza City near the coast. Late Thursday, the Israeli military said it had completely encircled Gaza City, cutting it off from the rest of the territory. That's a standard tactic on any battlefield, says Gian Gentile, a senior historian at the Rand Corp, and a retired colonel in the U. S. Army. ""Isolating an objective is a basic approach to war-fighting,"" he says. An image from Planet taken Oct. 30 shows dozens of Israeli tanks and armored vehicles arrayed in staging areas along the northern edge of Gaza City. Film and still images released by the Israeli military show forces in the same area. Based on the satellite imagery, the Israelis probably have a brigade consisting of several thousand troops operating in the northwest part of the city alone, says Sean MacFarland, a retired three-star general in the U. S. Army who conducted operations against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. ""It looks like they're starting to push in to establish a presence on the outskirts that they can use to launch operations deeper into the city,"" he says. Iraqi forces employed a similar tactic when attempting to regain control of the city of Ramadi from ISIS forces in 2015. But even if the other two axes also contain about a brigade, that wouldn't be nearly enough to fully occupy or even conduct a building-by-building sweep of a dense, urban environment like Gaza City, says Gentile. ""If you wanted to physically control Gaza City, with the population size, all the roads, all the angles and everything else, it would require multiple divisions to do that,"" Gentile says. (A division consists of multiple brigades. )MacFarland says, going block by block to clear the city ""would probably require more troops than the Israelis want to commit to that effort,"" in part because they need their forces in the north to protect the border with Lebanon. ""What they may choose to do instead is control the city from the outskirts and conduct operations inside,"" he says. Such raids might allow them to destroy tunnels and other key parts of Hamas infrastructure without committing to a full occupation. ""They're pushing in with ground forces, but their objective does not appear to be holding territory and setting up checkpoints,"" agrees Seth Jones, who oversees the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He believes that Israel is more likely to use airstrikes, armor and dismounted infantry to strike at individual targets. ""I think that is what they're doing, it's very specifically designed to go after infrastructure,"" Jones says. On Oct. 31, Israeli fighter jets conducted a massive airstrike on a section of the Jabalia refugee camp just north of Gaza City. According to the Israel Defense Forces, the strike was conducted with intelligence gathered by Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service. The Israeli military said dozens of Hamas fighters were killed, along with a senior Hamas commander. Photos from the site showed a massive crater, consistent with a collapsed tunnel beneath the site, and many injured civilians. Palestinians say the strike killed scores of people and Israel says Hamas was operating there. The incident underscores a dangerous new phase in operations, says Marc Garlasco, a former Pentagon intelligence officer who now works for Pax, a Dutch nonprofit working to protect civilians against acts of war. In the opening weeks of the war Israel conducted strikes on predetermined targets. Now they're striking quickly at ""dynamic targets"" with little warning or no warning for civilians in the area. Israel has tried to warn civilians in broad terms to leave northern Gaza, says Alex Plitsas, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in the Middle East programs group. ""They've attempted to clear the battlefield; they've asked people to leave,"" he says. But Garlasco, who has also worked as a U. N. war crimes investigator, says that Israel's obligations don't end with telling civilians to get out. ""While Israel has a right to defend itself, that right is not unlimited,"" he says. They must target military objects and not civilians, he says, and they must also operate under the principle of proportionality. ""Any attack they make, the military gain can not be outweighed by the civilian harm,"" he says. In a statement Wednesday, the United Nations' human rights office appeared to echo those concerns, warning that strikes on the Jabalia camp ""could amount to war crimes. ""Despite these worries, Israel appears to be using a great deal of heavy weaponry in its fight, some of which appears to be older, non-precision bombs, Garlasco says. Unguided bombs and artillery run the risk of incurring greater civilian casualties in a densely populated area like Gaza City. ""I'd say Israel is playing pretty fast and loose with the laws of war right now,"" Garlasco says. Israeli and Hamas forces are already involved in pitched fighting in different parts of the city. So far 24 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the fighting in Gaza since the ground invasion began last week, according to Israeli officials, while Hamas has not released full casualty numbers for its fighters. Those numbers will inevitably grow, says Gentile, who participated in urban warfare in Iraq in 2006. That's in part because both Israel and Hamas view this as an existential battle. Gentile suspects that Israel may be able to achieve its stated objective of largely destroying Hamas, but that the civilian toll will be high. ""Warfare in general is highly destructive against civilians, and it becomes even more so in a dense urban environment like Gaza City,"" he says. The humanitarian situation in Gaza may be what limits Israel's ability to reach its goals, says Plitsas. Through another group, Special Operations Association of America, he just helped get a number of NGO workers out of Gaza and the stories they told him were harrowing:""They were treating burns with saline and iodine only. There's no post-wound care, no antibiotics, hospitals were performing surgery without anesthesia because they had no choice,"" he says. Ultimately, he says, it's difficult to imagine that Israel will be able to maintain broader international support unless it can show that it is trying to help civilians and minimize casualties. ""I think the humanitarian conditions on the ground are an Achilles heel for the operation,"" he says. ""That needs to get addressed, and addressed very, very quickly.

267,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/02/1210110109/qatar-israel-gaza-hamas-war,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Qatar is a tiny nation that juts out of the Arabian Peninsula; it's about twice the size of Delaware, with just 300,000 citizens. Despite its small size, Qatar's influence spreads far. It's home to the Al Jazeera news network and a sprawling U. S. airbase with U. S. troops. Last year, it hosted the World Cup soccer games. And now it's playing a key role more than 1,000 miles to the west. It is a close U. S. ally and the regional power best positioned to both influence Hamas and play a mediating role with Israel. The war began Oct. 7, when nearly 2,000 Hamas militants stormed into Israel, killing around 1,400 people — mostly Israeli civilians, including women and children. The militants also took an estimated 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials. A quarter of a million Israelis have evacuated their homes due to the threat of further attacks, and Gaza rocket fire on Israel continues daily, though nearly all missiles are intercepted. Israel's bombardment and attacks on the Gaza Strip have since killed more than 9,000 people, 70% of whom are women and children, according to Palestinian health officials in Gaza. Nearly 200,000 homes have been destroyed and the Gaza Strip's 2. 3 million people are largely displaced, suffering from shortages of clean water, medicine, fuel, food and electricity. Qatar is not directly involved in the conflict, but is no bystander either. Here is what to know about its role in Gaza and beyond. In recent weeks, Doha has helped broker the release of four Israeli hostages held by Palestinian militants. It helped to negotiate — in coordination with the U. S. , Egypt, Israel and Hamas — for foreigners trapped in Gaza to leave through the territory's crossing with Egypt. Several dozen Palestinians, of more than 22,000 wounded in the war, have also been let out to receive treatment in Egypt this week, according to the Palestinian health officials. Qatar has been able to play this role because it has hosted Hamas leaders in exile, though it's unclear whether it can keep doing so amid growing pressure from the U. S. , Israel and Europe, which designate Hamas as a terrorist organization. A Qatari official, who asked that their name not be used to discuss a sensitive issue, told NPR the Hamas political office in Doha was opened over a decade ago in coordination with the U. S. , after a request from Washington to establish indirect lines of communication. Qatar says it's been used across multiple U. S. administrations for mediation efforts. The official reached out to NPR after this story was originally published. The Biden administration and senior Israeli officials have lauded Qatar's role in trying to free more than 200 hostages, among them children and elderly, held by militants in Gaza. Qatar has long hosted or directly talked to groups the U. S. and Europe do not want to deal with directly in difficult negotiations. That has helped Qatar exert influence, play a key role on the global stage and maintain relations with a wide range of players from Washington to Tehran. For years, Qatar has helped pay the partial salaries of tens of thousands of Palestinian teachers, doctors and other public servants in the Gaza Strip, which has been under an Israeli blockade, supported by Egypt, since Hamas wrested control of the territory in 2007. Israeli news reports and analysts say Qatar has sent more than $1 billion to Gaza over the past decade. Qatar sent that aid through fuel to the Gaza Strip's Hamas government, which in turn sold it and paid partial salaries. In the past, the money was sent via suitcases stuffed with cash. Israel allowed these transfers to Hamas. Supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say the payments his government approved helped keep the status quo in the Gaza Strip and Hamas from escalating attacks on Israel. His detractors say the policy was aimed at  weakening the rival Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and perpetuating the rift between the two Palestinian factions in order to avoid engaging in a real peace process and two-state solution. Qatar has also sent construction materials into Gaza after infrastructure was destroyed in previous Israeli wars. It also helped pay for United Nations food rations to Gaza's poorest families. The Qatar-based news network, primarily funded by the government, is one of the most widely seen Arabic channels in the world. It's also one of the very few broadcasting live from across the Gaza Strip throughout the current war. It's broadcasting on Arabic and English channels. The network has long angered Israel and some Middle East governments for its alternative viewpoints on major Mideast crises, like the Arab Spring revolts. Critics say the channel promoted Islamist movements. But for hundreds of millions of homes with Arabic satellite receivers that can watch Al Jazeera, it is an indispensable source of news and information. Israel's Cabinet recently approved measures that could lead to a shutdown of Al Jazeera's operations in the country. U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reportedly asked Qatar's emir to tone down Al Jazeera's coverage of the carnage in Gaza. The news network and Qatar have been intertwined since the Arabic channel's launch in 1996. Qatar's then-ruler financially backed it when it launched, and it has mostly been funded by the Qatari government, which derives much of its wealth from gas exports. Its chairman is a member of Qatar's ruling family. Al Jazeera says it operates independently. The network's journalists have been targeted or killed while covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Last year, Shireen Abu Akleh, a longtime Palestinian American reporter and household name in the Middle East, was killed while wearing a clearly marked ""press"" vest in the West Bank. Israel and the U. S. say an Israeli soldier was most likely responsible for killing her. In recent weeks, dozens of family members of Al Jazeera's staff in Gaza have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war, including the wife, son, daughter and grandchild of Gaza correspondent Wael Dahdouh. Qatar hosts thousands of U. S. troops at the Al Udeid Airbase, which also serves as the regional headquarters for U. S. Central Command. Doha is paying for an expansion of that airbase, which the U. S. and others have used to launch airstrikes against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. Qatar was instrumental in evacuating people from Afghanistan two years ago, during a chaotic and hurried U. S. evacuation from the country after it was taken over by the Taliban. Qatar has hosted U. S. -Taliban peace talks and other meetings, and continues to be home to members of the Taliban — and to Afghanistan-focused diplomats who withdrew from Kabul in 2021. Doha has helped free Western hostages held by extremist groups in Syria, and recently negotiated a high-profile prisoner swap between the U. S. and Iran. The country maintains close ties with Iran, with which it shares an underwater gas field in the Persian Gulf. Iran rushed to its aid when several Arab states cut ties with Qatar for several years over its policies in the region. President Biden designated Qatar as a major non-NATO ally, elevating the security partnership even more. Late last year, his administration described Qatar as one of the United States' ""closest military partners in the region"" and said Qatar's efforts in Gaza had helped to stabilize the territory. Meanwhile, Qatar is also home to senior Hamas leaders in exile, such as Khalid Mashaal and Ismail Haniyeh. It's unclear precisely how much Hamas leaders abroad knew about the Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel. They've come under scrutiny for their upscale lifestyles abroad as Gazans suffer at home. Qatar, like several other Arab states, has not publicly condemned the Hamas attacks on Israel. And like other Arab states and Iran, it has blamed Israeli policies for the escalation in violence, pointing to the occupation in the West Bank, deadly raids into Palestinian cities there and allowing more Israeli hardliners into the sensitive Al Aqsa Mosque compound, known to Jews as the Temple Mount. Still, Qatar was one of the first Gulf Arab states to establish official trade ties with Israel in the 1990s. But Israel's office in Doha was permanently shuttered after Israel's war in Gaza in 2009, and now there are no official ties between Israel and Qatar. Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani said ""enough is enough"" last week in a speech to his country's consultative Shura Council, describing Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip as ""barbaric. ""Despite this sharp rhetoric, Israel's Mossad intelligence chief was recently in Qatar to discuss the release of hostages held in Gaza.

268,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/02/1210107575/what-palestinians-in-the-west-bank-think-about-the-war-and-hamas,"RAMALLAH, West Bank — The daily news of the Israel-Hamas war has focused on life-or-death details: the names and numbers of Israelis killed or taken hostage in Hamas's October 7 attack; the names and numbers of Palestinians killed in the Israeli response — or, in recent days, the names of those allowed to leave. Difficult as it is to confirm those details, the bigger picture can be even harder to grasp. How much support does Hamas really enjoy among Palestinians? How does Israel intend to keep its promise to drive Hamas out of power? And what is the human cost?NPR sought insight into these questions by stepping back from Gaza to visit another largely Palestinian area, the West Bank, territory occupied by Israel since a war in 1967. A dozen NPR interviews with people in the West Bank, ranging from teenagers to senior leaders, gives some perspective to the battle to the southwest. Hamas is politically strong. The group does not rule on the West Bank, but has support. Walking through the narrow streets of the Al-Am'ari refugee camp — home to Palestinian families driven out of what became Israel in 1948, who first lived in tents and then gradually improvised concrete-block buildings — we saw Hamas graffiti on walls and posters celebrating men imprisoned by Israel. In a coffee shop, men did not talk about Hamas atrocities against Israelis; they talked of their constant ""humiliation"" at the hands of Israel's military occupation. Israel and the United States regard Hamas as a terrorist group which deliberately killed civilians long before the attack on Oct. 7. But Palestinians argue that it will be hard for Israel to meet its goal of destroying Hamas, because its ideology extends beyond any leader or group of leaders. Ahmed Aweida, a Palestinian businessman, described it as ""a legitimate political movement within the body politic of Palestinian society. "" He said the path of violence was not for ""me personally,"" but he understood why some chose it. Fatah is politically weak. The party of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas nominally governs the West Bank. Fatah has pursued a peace process since the late 1980's, and stands as Hamas's main rival for political power. Yet Israel, not Fatah, has the final say on nearly any matter of interest to Israel on the West Bank. The Fatah-run Palestinian Authority has cooperated with Israel on security matters, which undermines it in the eyes of some Palestinians. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who doesn't endorse the idea of a fully independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, circumvented the Palestinians seeking to normalize relations with their allies in the Arab world. Sabri Saidam, a senior Fatah official, says this helped ruin his party's standing. ""People are saying to us, OK, you have taken us on a ride for peace over decades. You have produced no results, so why not resort to armed confrontation?"" If Palestinians held an election even today, after the Hamas atrocities of October 7, Saidam said, ""I would like to see my party win, but I would say there's a lot of sympathy now for Hamas and Islamic Jihad. ""Fatah is not interested in taking over from Hamas. As a rival Palestinian party that cooperates with Israel, Fatah would seem to be the logical party to retake management of Gaza. But NPR correspondent Daniel Estrin, a longtime observer of the region, finds this unlikely. ""The Fatah-led Palestinian Authority would be incapable, and they refuse to take over Gaza on the backs of Israeli tanks. Palestinians would not accept that. ""This makes it uncertain what Israel's endgame can be. Suppose Hamas is toppled; who runs Gaza with its 2. 3 million people? Israel could resume its military occupation of Gaza, except it abandoned that occupation in 2005 as too costly and divisive. In October, a leaked Israeli policy paper talked of moving the people into Egypt, but forcibly relocating a population is considered a crime against humanity. Israel quickly said this was a ""preliminary"" idea. Ron Dermer, who is part of Israel's war cabinet as an observer, told NPR this week that it was ""premature"" to talk of any post war governance. Palestinians are depressed. On Wednesday, many Palestinians held a general strike, closing schools, shops and businesses in protest against Israel's bombing of Gaza. But from what we heard, many shops had already been closed and many people were staying home, presumably doom scrolling news that often affected their own friends and loved ones. Saidam, the Fatah official, told us he had lost 44 relatives to Israel's military campaign in Gaza, some of them distant and others close. ""It is impossible to think about anything else,"" said Ahmed Aweida, the businessman, who met us in a coffee shop he runs in one of the more prosperous districts of Ramallah. He described himself as ""extremely depressed. "" Aweida is no supporter of pushing Israel in the sea — he has talked for years of a ""rainbow state"" where all kinds of people would live with equal rights — but finds Israel's right-wing governments so intransigent that Hamas' atrocities gave him a kind of dark hope. He said it's possible that the calamity of the Hamas attack and the Israeli response may finally force the world to take seriously the aspirations of the Palestinian people. ""If that doesn't move the world now, I really don't know what will,"" he said. He counted this as optimism. Additional reporting by Reena Advani and Ziad Buchh from Ramallah.

269,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/02/1210094192/more-foreign-citizens-including-about-400-americans-are-set-to-depart-gaza,"RAFAH, the Gaza Strip — U. S. citizens say they're both happy and exhausted to have finally left the embattled Gaza Strip after nearly a month of bombardments and blockades — but they're also fearful for family and loved ones left behind. President Biden said ""74 American folks"" were able to leave Gaza Thursday. Dr. Barbara Zind, a pediatrician from Grand Junction, Colo. , went to Gaza on a humanitarian mission, but she spent nearly a month trapped by the war. She described a chaotic process when she navigated the Rafah crossing. ""There was chaos at the first door"" where people were told to wait to hear their name called on Wednesday, she said. ""And then you go into this other waiting room, and there was just chaos. ""Zind said it took about 12 hours for her and other aid workers to leave Gaza and cross into Egypt. She is expectd to fly home Thursday night. A Massachusetts family also made it out of Gaza on Thursday. Abood Okal, his wife, Wafaa Abuzayda, and their 1-year-old child had been turned away repeatedly as they tried to leave, and they had trouble finding clean drinking water. ""They're very happy"" to make it out, Boston attorney Sammy Nabulsi said on the family's behalf. ""They're exhausted. They're drained, they're emotionally and physically drained. They're also worried. They still have family behind in Gaza. ""Hundreds of Americans and other foreign passport holders are poised to leave the Gaza Strip this week — the first major departure of civilians from the territory since the war between Israel and the militant group Hamas began early this month. A new list of passport holders approved to depart — all of them foreign citizens or dual national Palestinians — was issued by the border authority overnight. It included around 400 Americans. The State Department has been in contact with about 400 Americans who have expressed a desire to leave, department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Wednesday. With their family members, the total number is around 1,000, Miller said. Haneen Okal, a 31-year-old mother of three, is on the list of American passport holders approved to leave Gaza. ""We can't describe our feelings of getting evacuated,"" she told NPR as she waited at the Rafah border crossing on Thursday. ""But we're still sad because what's happening in Gaza. The war is still there. """"I left my two sisters, my two brothers, and my mom and my dad,"" Okal said. ""My mom and my dad do have American citizenship, but they don't want to leave my other family members, so hopefully we can get them all out of there as soon as we can. """"It's a disaster. There is lack of food, electricity, power, no internet in there, bombing is all over. It's not safe at all,"" she said. ""I don't know when this situation will end, but it's really a disaster in there. "" At least 300 foreign citizens departed Gaza on Wednesday, according to the Gaza border authority, which is operated by Hamas. In addition, dozens of critically wounded Palestinians were transported by ambulance to hospitals in Egypt for treatment. Israel's airstrikes are ongoing, and its ground campaign inside Gaza has intensified. Israeli troops have entered from Gaza's north and east, and the Israeli military have reported multiple skirmishes between its soldiers and Hamas fighters. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives on Thursday passed a bill mostly along party lines that would provide $14. 3 billion for Israel. But the bill doesn't include funding for Ukraine, which Democrats supported, and contains provisions that would slash a funding increase for the Internal Revenue Service to boost enforcement to catch tax cheats. Democrats, who have the majority in the Senate, say the proposal pushed by new House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. , doesn't have a chance on that side of the Capitol. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N. Y. , called the bill a ""stunningly unserious proposal. ""President Biden has said he'll veto any legislation that doesn't include funding for Ukraine. The vote was 226-196, with 12 Democrats voting for it and two Republicans voting against it. In Gaza, access to water, food, fuel and medical care remain urgent humanitarian issues, the United Nations reports. More than 9,000 Palestinians have been killed since Oct. 7, according to Palestinian health officials. Some 240 hostages remain held by Hamas, who say dozens of them have died in Israeli airstrikes.  Calls for a cease-fire have grown from human rights groups, international leaders and left-leaning members of the Democratic Party. The White House, once steadfast in its support of Israel's opposition to a cease-fire, has shown support in recent days for what officials have called a ""humanitarian pause. ""On Wednesday, Biden himself called for one. ""I think we need a pause,"" he said, speaking to a crowd of supporters after giving a campaign speech. A brief cessation of military operations could ""give time to get the prisoners out,"" he added, which the White House later clarified to refer to hostages held by Hamas. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. , on Thursday became the first senator to call for a cease-fire, but he said that should come only after all the hostages being held by Hamas are released. Asked on CNN if he thought it was time for a cease-fire, Durbin replied ""I think it is. "" But he added: ""At least in the context of both sides agreeing. For example, the release of those who have been kidnapped should be part of this — immediate release. That should be the beginning of it. "" Later Thursday, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said Israel should reconsider its approach to rooting out Hamas and ""shift to a more deliberate and proportionate counterterrorism campaign. """"This does not mean that Israel should stop fighting Hamas, but it must take concrete steps to end the current widespread harm to innocent people and children inside Gaza,"" Murphy said in a statement. ""As we have learned from America's own counterterrorism campaigns, disproportionately large numbers of civilian casualties come with a moral cost, but also a strategic cost, as terrorist groups feed off of the grievances caused by civilian harm,"" Murphy said. At least 17 Israeli soldiers have died since Israel's ground troops entered Gaza in what officials have called the ""second phase"" of the war. In total, 332 Israeli soldiers have died in the conflict so far, most of them on Oct. 7. The health ministry in Gaza reports that 195 died in the Israeli strike on Jabalia refugee camp earlier this week, with 120 people still missing under the rubble. U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken left Washington on Thursday afternoon to travel to Israel and Jordan to push for the protection of civilians in Gaza and to work with leaders in the region to keep the conflict from spreading. Confrontations across northern Israel's border with Lebanon have escalated in recent days between the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Hamas militants and the Israeli military. Hezbollah said Thursday it attacked an Israeli army post with two suicide drones, and Hamas meanwhile said it fired 12 rockets from Lebanon toward the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, which has been evacuated. The Israeli military said it hit back with airstrikes and artillery fire aimed at Hezbollah's command and control centers, rocket launch posts and other infrastructure in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is scheduled to make his first public remarks since the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel. Blinken will also seek to increase the amount of aid getting in to Gaza and the number of U. S. citizens and other foreign nationals getting out. Blinken said one of his priorities will be discussions on setting the conditions for a sustainable peace in the region. ""We're focused on the day of; we also need to be focused on the day after,"" he told reporters before departing.  NPR's Becky Sullivan reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

270,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/02/1210087629/the-hamas-tunnels-a-wildcard-in-the-gaza-fighting,"Here's the bottom line when it comes to fighting an enemy hiding in a labyrinth of tunnels — you don't want to send your troops there. ""It's very dark and it's claustrophobic and it's narrow. And you lose your sense of direction immediately. You lose completely a sense of time,"" said Daphne Richemond-Barak, an Israeli military analyst and the author of Underground Warfare. The Israeli military has taken her into Hamas tunnels that crossed from Gaza into southern Israel. ""They are humid and suffocating. So when you walk in them, you would be disoriented for sure, but also incredibly afraid,"" she added. Hamas claims to have 300 miles of tunnels in Gaza, a subterranean complex that effectively serves as an all-purpose military compound. According to Israel, the underground space includes military headquarters, sleeping quarters, as well as workshops to make and store rockets. The Israeli military has overwhelming firepower compared to Hamas. But the group's underground passageways crisscross Gaza and are designed to allow Hamas fighters to quickly surface and strike Israeli troops without warning. Hamas has been shoveling for a long time in anticipation of such a battle. Chuck Freilich remembers the tunnels were part of the Israeli security discussions when he was Israel's deputy national security advisor in the early 2000s. He sees the vast expansion of the Hamas tunnels as part of Israel's broader intelligence failure in underestimating Hamas. ""You don't believe that the enemy can do X and so you don't see it,"" he said. ""Then in retrospect, it always turns out that there's lots of information in the system, but people, smart people, ignored it. ""With Israeli ground troops now deep inside Gaza, the tunnels are becoming a key factor in the fighting. The Israeli military said its ground forces were recently near the Erez crossing point, the northern border of Gaza, when troops spotted Hamas fighters emerging from a tunnel. The Israeli troops fired on them, killing or wounding the Hamas members, the military said. And when Israeli fighter jets unleashed a powerful airstrike on the Jabalia refugee camp on Tuesday, targeting a Hamas commander, the Israelis said the attack collapsed tunnels used by the group. Palestinians said the strike caused one of the highest civilian casualty tolls to date. Freilich said Israel faces another big challenge because Hamas is believed to be holding more than 200 hostages underground. ""I think there's all sorts of fancy technology being used to try and map out the tunnels,"" he said. ""But we may not know everything there is. Some booby trap is awaiting you at every turn. And of course, the hostages are probably down there somewhere. ""In a recent military briefing, Israel said Hamas has constructed military headquarters directly beneath Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa. ""Hamas terrorists operate inside and under Shifa Hospital and other hospitals in Gaza with a network of terror tunnels,"" said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Israel's military spokesman. Hamas vehemently denies this. The group says Israel makes these accusations to justify a relentless bombing campaign that's already killed thousands of Palestinian civilians. Hagari argues that it is Hamas that's cynically putting civilians at risk. ""Hamas not only endangers the lives of Israeli civilians, but also exploits innocent Gazan civilians as human shields,"" he said. Hamas first used the tunnels to shock Israel in 2006. The group dug a passageway under the Gaza border fence and emerged on the Israeli side, kidnapping an Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit. He was held for five years, and ultimately exchanged for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. When Israel upgraded its Gaza border fence a few years ago, it included a concrete barrier that went deep underground in an attempt to prevent Hamas from tunneling beneath it. Israel's military has also formed a mobile unit to detect tunnels and created a special team trained to fight in the tunnels. Still, Richemond-Barak says Israel is probably reluctant to send troops underground because the terrain would be so favorable for Hamas. ""Most military doctrines recommend against sending soldiers into the tunnels. Why? Because of the very high risk,"" said Richemond-Barak. The U. S. learned the harsh reality of fighting in the tunnels when American troops battled the Viet Cong in Vietnam. In the decades since, militaries have developed new weapons to combat them, like bunker-busting bombs and high-pressured water hoses to flood and collapse the tunnels.  ""What we're likely to see is Israel using a combination of these different methods and potentially even new ones,"" Richemond-Barak said. She says Israel knows destroying tunnels is hard. Five years ago, Israel discovered that the militant Hezbollah group had dug from southern Lebanon into northern Israel. She says it took the Israeli military six weeks to demolish five tunnels – just a tiny fraction of what Hamas has built beneath Gaza.

271,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/02/1210088881/a-tale-of-two-jerusalems-from-a-bus-crash-to-war-in-gaza-and-israel,"In 2012, a traffic collision outside Jerusalem set a school bus full of Palestinian children on fire. The bus burned for over 30 minutes before help arrived. One of the children on that school bus was Abed Salama's son, 5-year-old Milad Salama. At the time, Abed Salama didn't know whether his child was dead or alive. As he desperately tried to find Milad, he came up against barriers, both concrete and bureaucratic, that divided his Palestinian neighborhood of Anata from the rest of Jerusalem, which is controlled by Israel. In Nathan Thrall's new book, A Day in the Life of Abed Salama: Anatomy of a Jerusalem Tragedy, Thrall doesn't just trace Salama's search for his son. He profiles the many people, both Palestinian and Jewish, who come into contact with that accident. Through the story of these dead children, their parents, the emergency responders and the civilians who jump into action, Thrall paints a brutally honest picture of life under Israeli authority for both Jewish citizens and Palestinians who live under Israeli occupation. The accident happened over a decade ago, but Thrall says it is as relevant today as it was then. He and Salama sat down for an initial interview before the devastating war between Israel and Hamas began. Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7 and the ensuing Israeli air and ground invasion of Gaza changed so much about the reception of Thrall's book and about Salama's life. This Q&A with Nathan Thrall and Abed Salama is condensed from interviews conducted two weeks before and after the horrific Oct 7. attacks and the onset of the Israel-Hamas war. It has been edited and condensed for clarity and length. Listen to an audio except from the book here. Leila Fadel: How did you meet each other? And Abed, what made you decide to spend time and talk to Nathan, tell your story and be part of this book?Nathan Thrall: Well, I met Abed because I was investigating this terrible accident, and a family friend told me that one of the parents of the children who had passed away was a distant relative. So I asked if she could put me in touch with him. I was eventually put in touch with Abed and found myself at his home. Abed Salama: I decided to show Nathan everything and share my story when he told me maybe your story will make a difference in America and for others who read the article — maybe it would make some difference about our Palestinian issue. LF: I know this is a hard story for you to discuss. You lost your 5-year-old son, Milad. What was it that made you think, ""I want to talk about it""?AS: It was horrible for all the people in and around Palestine because they were only kids. The only thing they want is to go to a place to play. But because we didn't have any playgrounds, they had to make this trip. And someone was driving quickly. He crashed over their bus and killed them. And after the accident, the police, the Israeli government and the Palestinian government didn't really give us the results of the investigation into anyone. The Israeli court didn't even accept my case because my son and I have a Palestinian ID, and at the same time they took all the other cases related to the accident [because they had different IDs]. LF: What was it like to read this book?AS: I like it because he writes from the bottom of his heart. And when I read the article, I read it in English. I'm not strong in English, but I understand every word because he's telling the truth. LF: Nathan, why did you choose this day, this horrific accident in which Milad was killed and other children were killed and burned on a school bus as they tried to get to a playground for a field trip? Why did you choose this story with these people who live in or around Jerusalem?NT: There are a few reasons. One is that I live right next to where these children and parents and the teachers live. My apartment is about 2 miles from the wall that encircles and encloses these people who live in my same city but live an entirely different existence. And I would drive past this walled ghetto every week and hardly notice it. When this accident occurred, I couldn't stop thinking about the people who live on the other side of that wall, some of whom are, as I discovered, connected to me or relatives of close friends of mine. I felt that the accident really embodied the entire Israeli-Palestinian conflict: You had people living in the same community, half of whom have blue IDs, residents of Jerusalem, which entitles them to travel across the checkpoint that separates them from the rest of the city. Their relatives who live in the same community have green IDs. And this entire enclave, when you go into it, you can't tell the difference between the part that Israel has officially annexed and the part that is officially unannexed. It's all relatives living in this one community, some with green IDs, some with blue IDs and with very different rights. The color of their IDs has enormous repercussions every day. I really hoped that by telling human stories and by telling stories of love and cruelty and devotion and selflessness and guilt that I would be able to touch people and have them break through that kind of hardness that everyone has toward a conflict that they are sick of hearing about. LF: How did you go about this, and what were you trying to do? What was your process?NT: The main thing I was doing was talking to everyone and anyone involved in the accident, Jewish and Palestinian, from the founder of the settlement that is adjacent to the accident site, who ran out on that morning to try and see what had happened, to a group of settlers in a settlement adjacent to Anata where Abed lives. [They] came with a TV crew and entered his home a month after the accident and talked to him and tried to convince him that they had no ill will toward the people of Anata. I was talking to parents and teachers and doctors and nurses and a heroic man, a mechanic who just happened to be driving his car on the road on the day of the accident and ran into this burning bus and rescued dozens of children with the help of one other person. There's just tremendous pain in the lives of all Palestinians. Part of the telling of the story was to dig into family histories, to show people who are incredibly strong. But if you just scratch the surface, you see a universe of suffering. LF: Abed, when you first heard about the accident, I know you were searching for your son, but you have the green ID, right?AS: Yes. Many people told me my son was at the Israeli Hadassah hospital, but I couldn't go there because I didn't have a permit. There were people who said that a lot of children were taken to an Israeli army base close to the accident, but I didn't have a permit to enter there. A minute on this day was like waiting for hours. I felt like my son was close to me. During the first hours, I was standing outside the hospital in Ramallah, and his body was in the room behind me, not far away. I just didn't know. It's the moment when you lose hope, questioning whether your son is still alive, still breathing. What makes the tragedy even more unbearable is having to call your wife and son to deliver the news. Adam, my son, his only brother, was just 11 years old at the time. We were awaiting the results of the blood test from him for the DNA analysis. He walked 20 kilometers [about 12 miles] so they could draw blood from him. In the end, the doctors told him, ""Your brother is dead. ""LF: Nathan, could [you] talk about the larger system you were portraying that these parents were navigating on the most traumatic day of their lives and their children's lives?NT: The most important factor in determining whether these people had public schools, playgrounds, paved roads, sidewalks, whether they were encircled by a wall, whether the Jerusalem municipal services came and entered their area, whether firetrucks would go in there without an army escort — all these questions are determined by the fact that they're Palestinian. The very route of this wall, the path that it takes, was determined with one overriding logic, which was how to keep as many Palestinians as possible out of the heart of Jerusalem, for the Israeli state to relinquish as little land as possible. So all of these people are living in this extremely crowded enclave simply because of a desire to demographically engineer the city of Jerusalem and keep as many Palestinians out as possible — people who were born and raised in the city. LF: What do you want people to take from this book? NT: The main thing I want is for people to feel viscerally what it is to live in this place, for both Jews and Palestinians. I feel that we have spent too much time speaking in abstractions: two states, one state, confederation. These abstractions are a means of taking our attention away from an absolutely unacceptable present and having us all focus on debating some future that may or may not come. AS: I hope they understand that we have the right to live and love. To play. Like others. We can live together. We can build relations together. LF: Nathan, what did the Israel-Hamas war mean for the book that you wrote?NT: I've had events canceled in five cities, one of them by the U. K. police, who were targeting anything with ""Palestinian"" in the title. I wasn't alone — other events were also canceled in the U. K. An entire conference was shut down. It's an atmosphere of total intolerance for any sympathy for Palestinians living under occupation. You know, 2. 3 million Gazans are starved of  food, water and electricity and fuel. These people had nothing to do with the Hamas attack, were as surprised by the Hamas attack as Israelis were. I was traveling with Abed on the book tour. He was horrified to learn of the atrocities committed on October 7th, as was I. If a book like that is being targeted, we're in an atmosphere where virtually nothing can be said. And this is precisely the kind of conversation we need to be having in order to address the deep roots of this recurrent bloodshed. LF: What do you mean by that?The root cause of all of the recurrent violence that we see and the daily violence that we ignore when there isn't a war in Gaza is that 7 million Israeli Jews and 7 million Palestinians live under Israeli rule and the vast majority of those Palestinians do not have basic civil rights. There is no place in the world where you could have people living without basic civil rights for decades, with support from the United States and the whole world, where you would not have violence to keep that system in place. This is not a justification ever of killing or harming civilians. LF: Where is Abed right now?NT: He left the U. S. to return to his family. It was just too difficult for him to be away from them. After the attack on Oct. 7, Israel shut down many West Bank towns. A lot of them are still closed. They shut down the towns of Anata and Shuafat refugee camp. You know, every family in the West Bank relies on higher-paying jobs in Israel, in the settlements. Those employers are not allowing Palestinians to come to work right now. There is also a surge in settler violence in the West Bank such that even driving on the roads is unsafe for Palestinians. There's a spike in the killings of Palestinians in the West Bank. Abed's son Adam works in Ramallah, and his employer told him not to come to work because it's unsafe to drive from Anata to Ramallah. After NPR's last interview with Nathan Thrall, Abed Salama shared that his wife's cousin's son, Yazan Shiha, 24, was killed during an Israeli raid in the West Bank, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Salama's sister-in-law, Ruba Al-Najjar, lost her aunt Feryal Khyal and Khyal's granddaughter Dalia Khyal. They were killed by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. The family is worried about Khyal's daughter Soha and two grandchildren, as their whereabouts remain unknown.

272,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/01/1209973578/israel-hamas-gaza-south-america,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil — This week, Bolivia severed diplomatic relations with Israel, Chile and Colombia recalled their ambassadors from Tel Aviv, and Brazil pleaded for an immediate halt to the killing of children in the Gaza Strip. The criticism coming from South America's left-wing governments has intensified in recent days as thousands of Palestinians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes and shelling, according to health officials in Gaza. On Tuesday, Bolivia's deputy foreign minister, Freddy Mamani Machaca, said his government was cutting ties with Israel over its ""aggressive and disproportionate military offensive"" in Gaza, which he called ""a threat to international peace and security. ""Bolivia's interim foreign minister, María Nela Prada, demanded an end to Israeli attacks that she said have caused ""thousands of civilian fatalities and forced displacement of Palestinians,"" and implored an end to blocking humanitarian aid and work by international organizations in Gaza. In response, Israel's Foreign Ministry accused Bolivia of ""aligning itself with the Hamas terrorist organization"" that killed 1,400 people in Israel and took 240 hostages on Oct. 7. ""Israel condemns Bolivia's support of terrorism and its submission to the Iranian regime, which attest to the values the government of Bolivia represents,"" the ministry said. Israel says its offensive in the Gaza Strip is to crush Hamas, which has ruled the territory since 2007. Meanwhile, other South American countries recalled their ambassadors from Israel, including Chile. Chilean President Gabriel Boric tweeted that Israel was violating international humanitarian law and its airstrikes amounted to ""collective punishment"" in Gaza. Colombia also summoned its ambassador from Israel, with Colombian President Gustavo Petro calling Israel's actions ""a massacre of the Palestinian people. "" He posted a photo to X, formerly Twitter, showing dozens of bodies wrapped in white sheets, and wrote ""the head of the state who carries out this genocide is a criminal against humanity. ""Relations between Israel and several leftist governments in South America have been strained for years. In Bolivia, former President Evo Morales severed ties with Israel in 2009 following the country's military actions in Gaza. A conservative administration that replaced Morales restored relations with Israel a decade later. Morales, who still yields support in Bolivia, has called Israel a ""terrorist state"" and urged that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be tried for war crimes in an international tribunal. Benjamin Gedan, director of the Latin America Program at the Wilson Center in Washington, D. C. , said many of the South American leaders' critiques of Israel's response to the Hamas massacre are principled. But, ""in many cases, criticism of Israel is a proxy for a worldview that reflexively regards the United States and its allies as bad actors. For U. S. antagonists such as Evo Morales of Bolivia, sympathy for Hamas is the ultimate expression of an 'enemy of my enemy is my friend' foreign policy,"" he told NPR. But Israel is losing the battle of narratives across Latin America, says Oliver Stuenkel, an associate professor of international relations at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, a university in São Paulo, Brazil. ""In the same way that it is losing the battle in the Global South, perhaps with the exception of India,"" he added. India's government has spoken out in support of Israel and condemned Hamas' attacks against the country. Brazil had hoped the United Nations Security Council would pass a resolution calling for a ""humanitarian pause"" in the fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas militants. Brazil is a non-permanent member of the Security Council and assumed the body's rotating chair last month. Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira slammed its inability to pass a resolution and condemned what he called a ""persistent use of the council for personal interests rather than prioritizing the protection of civilians. ""The United States voted against Brazil's draft, and later put forward a resolution that included support for Israel's right to defend itself, while calling for the release of hostages and for humanitarian aid for Gaza — which Russia and China vetoed. In a tweet Tuesday night, Brazil's left-wing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, lamented the deaths of children in Gaza, which the U. N. says has surpassed 3,500. Lula finished off the message with a rebuke of the United Nations and a plea to end the hostilities, saying, ""Stop! For the love of God, stop!""",npr_articles/article_272.txt,npr_results/article_272.txt.json
273,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/01/1209789324/democrats-israel-palestinians-progressive-foreign-policy,"The progressive Jewish group If Not Now went to Capitol Hill last week to talk to lawmakers and hold a rally. While the group sang a call-and-response of ""cease-fire now"" and ""not in our name"" next to the Reflecting Pool, Matan Arad-Neeman, the group's spokesman, explained why they were there. ""We've only seen — what is it — 17 members of Congress so far call for a cease-fire. And I'm so grateful for their moral courage,"" he said. ""But the rest of Congress needs to step up and end this bloodshed. ""As of today, 18 House members have signed on to a resolution calling for a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas. That's a small minority, but it represents a real, ongoing divide among Democrats. In March, Gallup found that for the first time in more than two decades of tracking, Democrats sympathized with Palestinians more than Israelis. About half of Democrats said their sympathies are more with Palestinians, compared to about 4 in 10 who said their sympathies are more with the Israelis. That divide is decades in the making. The U. S. supported Israel from its founding, with President Harry Truman the first world leader to recognize the new state of Israel in 1948. U. S. involvement grew in the 1960s and '70s — in the Cold War, the Soviet Union allied itself with some Arab nations, even going so far as to arm them. ""In the 1970s you see the emergence of a real special relationship there, where the United States gives Israel quite generous support and to a large extent gives it unconditionally,"" explained Stephen Walt, professor of international relations at Harvard's Kennedy School. Since then, American leaders of both parties have maintained that special relationship. Proponents have argued it's strategically important to have a strong democratic ally in the Middle East. Walt — co-author of the controversial book The Israel Lobby and U. S. Foreign Policy, which was criticized for its views on U. S. -Israel ties — also points to domestic influence from pro-Israel groups as a factor in the alliance. Most notable among those groups is the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, and Walt says that the influence is asymmetrical. ""There's hardly any countervailing forces on the other side,"" he said. ""There are some, you know, sort of pro-Palestinian, you know, pro-Arab, pro-Muslim groups, but they're much less numerous [and] politically influential. ""Despite the tight U. S. -Israel alliance, there have still been reasons over the years why some Democrats have questioned that bond. For one thing, the behavior of Israeli leaders can push away American voters — like the friction between Israel's conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-President Barack Obama. ""Netanyahu clearly appeared to be aligning very much against the Obama administration and with the Republican Party,"" Walt said. ""This angered lots of Democrats. ""In addition, Israel has had right-leaning prime ministers for much of the last 30 years; the country's rightward shift, Walt said, has likely made some Democrats less willing to support the country. There has also been a pronounced generational split — polling shows young Americans are more critical of Israel than their elders. That isn't an entirely new phenomenon — during the Vietnam War, young leftists who already opposed that war started to question U. S. involvement in Middle East politics. ""These are the youngsters on campus who are protesting against the war,"" said Osamah Khalil, professor of history at Syracuse University. ""And then some of them start to look at Israel's role in the Middle East and say, are we seeing kind of the same dynamic here about U. S. foreign policy?""Mark Mellman is founder of the Democratic Majority for Israel, which promotes pro-Israel Democrats. He says time has helped drive the age divide. ""First of all, we're farther away from the Holocaust,"" he said. ""The Holocaust is not a lived experience of most people anymore. ""That split goes hand in hand with an ideological divide. Especially since the Hamas attack last month, that divide has grown bitter. Some Democrats have been hurt, and enraged, by some progressive groups who immediately blamed Israel. That view by no means represents progressives as a whole. But when it comes to why an ideological split exists, Mellman is blunt; he thinks the left needs to be better educated. ""I would argue that the far left does not accurately or adequately understand the issues at stake in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,"" he said. In particular, he said, many critics of Israel misunderstand who the victims and oppressors are: ""We would argue that the rights of people in Gaza have been abrogated by Hamas much more than by Israel. ""For his part, Syracuse history professor Khalil argues that many young progressives do understand the situation, and they see Israel's longstanding treatment of Palestinians — for example, heavy restrictions on Gaza residents' movements — as a form of systemic oppression. He adds that it's a lens through which progressives already see many domestic issues. ""Young Americans are able to put the situation of the Palestinians into a broader perspective and see these parallels — whether it is other settler colonial examples or when they look at the treatment of Indigenous people, when they look at treatment of minorities,"" he said. Some progressives have long drawn those parallels, particularly in some communities of color — for example, in Black Lives Matter's years-long support for pro-Palestinian causes. Israel's attacks on Gaza, which have killed thousands, have therefore only intensified some progressives' senses of injustice regarding the conflict. To Walt, at Harvard, it's easy to overstate the number of Democratic politicians who are critical of Israel. ""Yes, there are some prominent voices in the Democratic Party, in the so-called progressive movement — AOC [New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], [Minnesota Rep. ] Ilhan Omar, [Michigan Rep. ] Rashida Talib — but they're still quite a small minority within the party,"" he said. Still, the Democratic divide isn't going away. At the rally in D. C. , Arad-Neeman said he thinks that the party's drift on this issue will continue. ""I think so many young people have seen decades of U. S. and Israeli policy of just maintaining the system of apartheid fail,"" he said. ""And it's so clear — I'm Israeli-American; it hasn't kept my family safer. ""President Biden has continued to walk a fine line on the conflict, saying Israel has the right to defend itself, but also pushing for more aid for the Palestinians, and for Israel to protect civilians.",npr_articles/article_273.txt,npr_results/article_273.txt.json

""  As the first groups of people left Gaza, ambulances from Egypt also entered the Rafah crossing to evacuate critically injured people from the besieged territory, where Israeli airstrikes have killed thousands since Oct. 7, when the militant group Hamas launched a brutal attack on Israeli towns. The Gaza border crossing authority, which is run by the Hamas government in Gaza, announced early Wednesday that the Rafah border would be open for  injured people and some foreign passport holders to exit the territory. The authority published a list of people that it said were approved to exit. The list included the names and passport information of nearly 500 foreigners, most of them citizens of eight countries or who are associated with NGOs. It is possible the list of 489 foreign nationals is not comprehensive and more people will be added. People departing Gaza Wednesday told NPR that the opportunity to escape the constant bombardment and ever-growing humanitarian crisis was bittersweet. ""It's not the greatest feeling, to be honest. It's not,"" said Jamila Muhaisen, a 24-year-old Bulgarian citizen. ""I have family here. I have friends here. It's not OK to just leave a burning city. ""Some 500 foreign passport holders were allowed to leave on Wednesday, according to the U. N. More than half of the people on the approved exit list were Jordanian citizens. Others were from Austria, Australia and Japan. Many foreign nationals whose names weren't on the list came to the border anyway on Wednesday out of hopes that they, too, would be allowed out. But Gaza border officials turned them away at the gate. ""I'm going to keep on coming,"" said Wafa Elsaka, a Palestinian-American who was not allowed to exit Wednesday. ""I don't want to hear, 'We gave you a chance and you didn't make it. '""Dozens of Americans in Gaza recently sued the U. S. government, accusing it of unequal treatment and urging it to arrange an evacuation. They note that after fighting broke out, the State Department chartered cruise ships to carry Americans out of Israel. The U. S. also arranged numerous charter flights for U. S. citizens who wanted to leave Israel. Nearly 60 names on the approved list were associated with aid groups, including United Nations agencies and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Seven of those listed were Americans. U. N. agencies and aid groups have plans to rotate their staff in Gaza where possible. On Friday, a team of 10 ICRC staff, including surgeons and a weapons expert, entered Gaza via the Rafah crossing. ""We also were able to do some rotation of U. N. staff,"" Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the UN Secretary-General António Guterres, said on Wednesday, calling the border opening an important step in dealing with the humanitarian crisis. The Gaza Border Authority said 81 ""seriously injured"" people would be taken to hospitals in Egypt for medical care. All of the patients are Palestinians, according to the Egyptian health ministry. ""The World Health Organization welcomes Egypt's decision to accept 81 injured and sick people from the Gaza Strip for treatment,"" the WHO said in a statement, adding that its staff had helped Egypt establish a plan to evacuate and care for the critically wounded. Egypt later said that only about 70 patients would be transferred, as the remaining patients had already died. The patients will be transported to hospitals in Egypt's Sinai peninsula, the Egyptian health ministry said. On Tuesday, 59 trucks bearing aid entered Gaza — the largest number of trucks in one day since aid began crossing on Oct. 21. Israel continues to block the delivery of fuel. Dozens of additional trucks were expected to enter Gaza Wednesday. The activity at the border took place as internet and phone service in Gaza went out again temporarily. The Palestinian telecommunications company Paltel attributed the outage to ""international routes that were previously reconnected being disconnected again. "" Service has since resumed. The announcements followed a 34-hour communications blackout in Gaza over the weekend that coincided with the start of Israel's ""expanded"" ground operations. On Tuesday, Israeli airstrikes caused significant damage to a large refugee camp in Jabalia, just north of Gaza City. The Israeli military said it was targeting the area, which it says is a Hamas ""stronghold,"" including underground tunnels and a command center. A precise number of casualties and injuries isn't yet known; initial reports from the health ministry in Gaza said a large number of people were wounded or killed. Biden has walked a fine line between supporting Israel's right to defend itself and urging it to take care to avoid civilian casualties as it goes after Hamas in Gaza. At the same time, he has tried to quell inflamed sentiments over the conflict at home. On Wednesday the White House announced plans to develop the country's first national strategy on countering Islamophobia. The Domestic Policy Council and National Security Council are working with community leaders, advocates and members of Congress on the plan, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement, noting the history of discrimination and attacks against people who are Muslim or who are perceived to be Muslim, such as Arabs and Sikh Americans. The statement cited the killing of 6-year-old Palestinian American Wadea Al-Fayoume and the brutal attack on his mother, who were stabbed outside Chicago by a man now charged with hate crimes. Biden cited Wadea's killing in an Oval Office speech last month making a case for additional funding for Israel and for Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion.

Patrick Dai, a junior, allegedly posted threats ""to kill or injure another using interstate communications,"" a felony. He has yet to enter a plea and is expected to appear in federal court on Wednesday in Syracuse, New York. Officials say he remains in custody. According to federal prosecutors, Dai allegedly posted comments on an online discussion site on Sunday, calling for the deaths of Jewish people and saying he was ""gonna shoot up"" a building frequented by Jewish students. In a separate post, Dai allegedly threatened to stab male students, sexually assault female students and said he would ""bring an assault rifle to campus and shoot all you pig jews,"" according to a statement released by the U. S. Attorney's Office in the Northern District of New York. Dai is innocent until proven guilty. If convicted, the U. S. Attorney's Office said he could face up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. ""We remain shocked by and condemn these horrific, anti-semitic threats and believe they should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,"" said Joel Malina, a spokesman for Cornell University in a statement. ""Cornell Police will maintain its heightened security presence on campus,"" he added. The threats posted Sunday sent waves of fear through the Jewish community in Ithaca. They prompted a visit to campus by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. In a speech Tuesday, Hochul warned of rising antisemitism on college campuses across New York state. She cited to the threats at Cornell but said bigotry against Jewish people has taken root on other campuses, including the City University of New York in New York City. ""The problem didn't begin in the weeks following October 7 attacks [by Hamas against Israel],"" Hochul said. ""It's been growing on a number of campuses and seen most acutely in the City University of new York. ""She said retired state Judge Jonathan Lippman would lead a probe of CUNY policies and procedures relating to ""antisemitism and discrimination. ""In recent weeks, violence in Israel and Gaza has led to growing tension at universities across the U. S. , with large pro-Palestinian protests on some campuses. Hochul said during some of those protests ""free speech crossed the line into hate speech. ""While focusing much of her address on antisemitism, Hochul also condemned hate speech and bigotry against Muslim and Palestinian New Yorkers.

277,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/31/1209549210/gaza-blackout-mobile-internet-israel-war,"GAZA STRIP — For 34 hours over the weekend, the Gaza Strip went dark, as Israeli tanks rolled in. Phone, cellular and internet services dropped Friday evening, leaving most of Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians unable to communicate with each other or the rest of the world. Israel sent in ground troops to pursue Hamas in Gaza after the militant group's unprecedented assault on Oct. 7 in Israel killed 1,400 people and took 240 hostages, Israeli officials say. Israel's response, with airstrikes and shelling, has killed more than 8,500 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, and its total blockade of the territory has left many with no access to basic necessities. Palestinian telecommunications providers blamed the service outage on deliberate Israeli sabotage. An Israeli defense official said she was ""unaware"" of the matter. It happened just as Anas Baba, NPR's producer in the Gaza Strip, was getting ready to tape an interview with NPR's All Things Considered. Baba said his line was ""a bit bouncy"" before the interview began. ""Maybe you're going to hear me and maybe not,"" he told NPR's Juana Summers. Then the call dropped. A few hours later, he regained service for a few minutes, and sent NPR a short text message: ""I'm alive. ""Then his connection dropped again. By the time he regained contact on Sunday, he described a weekend of uncertainty, isolation, desperation and death. Baba sent NPR a series of voice memos over the weekend. The first voice memo came about 24 hours into the Gaza communications outage, when he briefly connected to an Israeli cellphone signal. He described conditions from Friday evening to Saturday evening:""We all are struggling to get any connection from Jawwal [a Palestinian cell service provider], internet, or even landlines. We truly don't know anything. We don't know what exactly is happening, or where. We are totally cut off from the outside world. Every single person in Gaza, especially the ones that you know, relatives, friends, family, are unreachable. Even at the news, we cannot understand what is happening. ""Baba traveled from Rafah in southern Gaza, where he is sheltering, to his home city in northern Gaza, which Israel had urged residents to evacuate. ""Today I was lucky to visit Gaza City. . . . What I saw is horrific and terrifying for anyone who one day was living as a Gazan. Neighborhoods are totally flattened to the ground. You cannot find people, you cannot even understand where they are. I tried to find a single person, but I couldn't. ""I heard from the ambulance paramedics that yesterday was a total shutdown for all the radio that they have. They couldn't even know where to go, where to head, or the many casualties on the ground. The bombardment all over the Gaza Strip was totally intense. . . . Everyone in Gaza is concerned about his own beloved. ""This is not my city. I cannot even realize what street it is. I only can smell death: dead bodies under the rubble. ""By the end of the weekend, Palestinian health officials said over 1,000 people, including many from the same families, were killed in Israel's intensified weekend bombardment. Baba returned south to Rafah, where he is sheltering, to witness scenes of desperation. Getting around sometimes meant taking a horse cart, with fuel supplies dwindling. ""Today it was a struggle just to find some bread, some water, and even to understand where to go, or how to go. . . . Yesterday I was forced to return home from Khan Younis to Rafah city, where I am based and located, using a horse cart. And today, I couldn't even find that horse cart anymore. ""All the supermarkets are empty. ""Nothing is the same, nothing is the same. I am reporting now for you from Rafah, and my heart is still there, my memories are still there [in Gaza City]. ""Don't know what to do, don't know what to say. Don't know how to describe the damage. . . . It's flattened, totally flattened to the ground. Nothing is the same, nothing is standing. ""Baba sent his first voice memos on Saturday night, in the midst of the communications outage. For an hour and a half, he connected to an Israeli cellular network by getting close to the Israeli border, a dangerous prospect, especially in wartime. ""It's super, super dangerous, but I needed to understand what's happening around me. For a journalist, not for a normal citizen, my mind was going to melt trying to understand what is happening. ""I just put myself in danger in order to get some internet from the [Israeli] provider Cellcom, near the border. I can't stay there much more. . . . I'm so sorry, I need to just evacuate the area . . . the artillery, everything is going insane here. ""Before dawn Sunday, phone service came back. Baba sent a new voice memo from Rafah. ""When the reception totally came back, I heard a lot of people screaming from happiness, shouting with a lot of slogans that finally, we are back. ""But the most catastrophic: When you hear the stories of some of the people who are still trying to reach some of their beloved, their families, their friends. ""Some of the people here are telling me that 20 days of the war with signal and reception was OK. But two days without reception and telecommunication was around 20 years for us. Being totally blind and disconnected is making you feel angry, helpless, and at the same time, vulnerable. ""On Sunday, nearly three dozen aid trucks carrying food, water and medicine crossed from Egypt into southern Gaza — the largest convoy in a single day since the war began, but not enough for the population, aid groups say.

278,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/31/1208800238/the-telegram-app-has-been-a-key-platform-for-hamas-now-its-being-restricted-ther,"Telegram, the popular messaging app, has blocked a number of channels with ties to Hamas. The move followed Apple and Google coming under pressure from outside groups to force Telegram to block channels that violated the tech giants' terms of service. While accounts related to Hamas have been banned across most other major social networks, Telegram has emerged as one of Hamas' central platforms, thanks to the company's unfiltered approach to social media, allowing first-person accounts of the brutal Israel-Hamas war to spread widely. Some of the channels amassed hundreds of thousands of subscribers and sent out graphic images and videos of the war, in addition to calls to action from Hamas members. Last week, the pro-Israel Zachor Legal Institute sent Apple a letter pointing out seven accounts with connections to Hamas that were still available on Telegram for Apple users, while Telegram had removed them for Android devices. The group pleaded with Apple to force Telegram to also remove the channels from being available on iPhones and other Apple devices. Less than 24 hours later, Telegram banned on Apple devices four of the seven channels Zachor Legal Institute highlighted, including Qassam Brigades, a channel dedicated to Hamas' military wing that had more than 700,000 subscribers and an account known as Spokesman_ 2020 that had more than 500,000 followers. But three other channels with links to Hamas, which together have nearly 1 million subscribers, were still active Telegram channels on iPhones.  It is not clear why Telegram disallowed some Hamas channels and let others remain. A spokesman for Telegram did not return a request for comment. Whether Apple applied pressure on Telegram to remove the channels is uncertain; Apple has not responded to multiple requests for comment. But Zachor Legal Institute says it believes Apple was responding to its demands. ""Hamas uses these channels as psychological terror tools to influence Western public,"" said Ron Machol, Zachor Legal Institute's Chief Operating Officer. A spokesman for Google would not confirm whether it asked Telegram to remove Hamas channels, but pointed to the company's app store policies which require that apps moderate content that celebrates terrorist attacks or promotes violence. ""When violations are found we take appropriate action,"" a Google spokesman said. The decision to ban Hamas-aligned channels came despite Telegram CEO Pavel Durov's longtime support of keeping the channels open and free of content policing. Durov, a Russian-born tech mogul who is now based in Dubai, has argued on his platform that the Hamas channels have provided an important source of information about the war. Earlier this month, Durov said in a Telegram message that Hamas has used channels on his platform to warn Palestinian civilians about looming missile strikes. ""Would shutting down their channel help save lives — or would it endanger more lives? While it would be easy for us to destroy this source of information, doing so risks exacerbating an already dire situation,"" he wrote. Meta, Google and X, formerly Twitter, block all accounts with links to Hamas. Telegram's more hands-free approach to moderating Hamas has led to a surge in subscribers. For instance, the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab found that a channel dedicated to Hamas' military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, grew to more than 600,000 since the war started, more than tripling its number of subscribers. Gaza Now, another Hamas-aligned channel, had 350,000 followers when the war broke out, now has nearly 2 million subscribers. It often reposts Hamas posts, and the channel is available on both Apple and Google devices. Critics of Telegram have for weeks called on the company to remove Hamas accounts, arguing that the platform is amplifying terrorist propaganda and being used to defend grisly acts of violence. Being in violation of Apple and Google's app store rules could result in an app being removed from the mobile app stores both companies control. Both Apple and Google have rules against apps that promote violence. Being kicked out Apple and Google's app stores would make it impossible for new users to download the app, and it would also slowly cripple the functionality of the service since Telegram would have no way to send its 800 million monthly active users software updates.

The threat of international terrorism in the U. S. had largely subsided in recent years, particularly since the defeat of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. But senior American officials say Hamas' deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel has created a new dynamic with dangerous implications at home and abroad. ""The reality is that the terrorism threat has been elevated throughout 2023, but the ongoing war in the Middle East has raised the threat of an attack against Americans in the United States to a whole other level,"" Wray said in testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Hamas' attack, which killed some 1,400 people in Israel, ""will serve as an inspiration the likes of which we haven't seen since ISIS launched its so-called caliphate years ago,"" Wray said. He said the FBI has no evidence of a imminent threat from a foreign terrorist group, but he noted that since Hamas' attack on Israel, al-Qaida has issued its most specific call for violence against the U. S. in years, while the Islamic State has urged its followers to target Jewish communities in the United States and Europe. Christine Abizaid, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told lawmakers that the Israel-Hamas war has featured in messaging and propaganda since Oct. 7. ""We've seen it from al-Qaida affiliates, almost every single one of them,"" she told lawmakers, referring to terrorist groups in the Mideast and Africa with ties to al-Qaida. ""We've also seen it from ISIS, which isn't ideologically aligned with a group like Hamas but is still leveraging this current conflict to try to sow the kind of violence, bring adherence to its cause in a kind of exploitative way. "" On the home front, Wray said the biggest concern for the FBI is that violent extremists — including people inspired by foreign terrorist groups but also domestic violent extremists — will draw inspiration from the ongoing conflict to carry out attacks against Americans. ""We've seen that already with the individual we arrested last week in Houston, who'd been studying how to build bombs and posted online about his support for killing Jews,"" Wray said. ""And with the tragic killing of a 6-year-old Muslim boy in Illinois in what we're investigating as a federal hate crime. ""But Wray said he's also concerned about traditional, formal terrorist organizations like al-Qaida, ISIS or Hezbollah potentially carrying out strikes in the U. S. ""We are not currently tracking an imminent, credible threat from a foreign terrorist organization, a structured attack here or something like that, but it is something that we think heightened vigilance is warranted for,"" he said.  ""It is a time to be concerned,"" he said. ""We are in a dangerous period. ""At the same time, he urged Americans not to be intimidated. ""This is not a time for panic, but it is a time for vigilance,"" he said. ""We shouldn't stop conducting our daily lives, going to schools, houses of worship and so forth. But we should be vigilant. ""Abizaid said the U. S. has no intelligence that indicates Iran or its proxies, most notably the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, ""had any foreknowledge"" of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. But she said the U. S. remains focused on Iranian activities — and those of its allies — targeting American interests since the war's outbreak. She noted that militant groups aligned with Tehran have conducted 24 attacks against American forces in Iraq and Syria. Despite those strikes, she said Washington doesn't believe Iran currently is interested in escalating the conflict. ""We assess Iran, Hezbollah and their linked proxies are trying to calibrate their activity, avoiding actions that would open up a concerted second front with the U. S. or Israel while still exacting costs in the midst of the current conflict,"" she said. ""This is a very fine line to walk and, in the present regional context, their actions carry the potential for miscalculation thus requiring heightened scrutiny in the region and we monitor for signs that the conflict could spread. ""On the domestic front, she said she has no indications of any Iranian threat inside the U. S. , though she cautioned that Iran has a ""significant escalatory capability"" that it could call on if Tehran decided it wanted to ramp up the conflict.

280,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/31/1209646548/israel-military-central-gaza-fighting-hamas,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli airstrikes caused significant damage to a large refugee camp in Jabalia, just north of Gaza City, on Tuesday. The Israeli military confirms it was targeting the area, which it says is a Hamas ""stronghold,"" including underground tunnels and a command center. Photos from the scene showed large craters and other damage at the camp, where teams of people lined up bodies in rows, covered by white sheets. Hamas officials said at least six airstrikes demolished apartment buildings in the residential area. A precise number of casualties and injuries isn't yet known; initial reports from the health ministry in Gaza said a large number of people were wounded or killed. The Israeli military said its troops killed dozens of Hamas fighters in western Jabalia, in an operation that included airstrikes. The object was a ""military stronghold"" used by the commander of a Hamas battalion, the military said. The operation targeted underground tunnels that lead to the coast, as well as a weapons production facility and rocket launch positions, Israel's military said. Even before the current war displaced masses of people, Jabalia was the largest refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. Palestinians have taken refuge there since 1948 — the year Israel was created — according to the U. N. Palestine refugee agency, or UNRWA. Jabalia is the name of both the camp and a nearby village. Israeli forces fought with fighters from the militant group Hamas in central Gaza on Tuesday, as Israel's ground campaign in the embattled territory continued into its fifth day. According to Palestinian witnesses, Israeli troops have entered Gaza from its north and east. Israeli military officials have reported skirmishes between Hamas fighters and Israeli soldiers. An NPR producer in central Gaza reported the presence of an Israeli tank and bulldozer located south of Gaza City on Salah al-Deen, the main highway that runs north-to-south through the Gaza Strip. All the while, Israel's unrelenting airstrike campaign over the entirety of Gaza has continued. Airstrikes hit at least 300 targets in Gaza during the past day, Israel said Tuesday. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have evacuated from the northern half of Gaza, packing into any available shelter in the south. Schools, hospitals and mosques are all sheltering hundreds of people, and private homes are crowded with dozens or more. In total, 1. 4 million Palestinians have been displaced from their homes, the U. N. says. Israeli strikes have been pounding areas near hospitals in northern Gaza, according to UNRWA. ""All 13 hospitals that are still operational in these areas have received repeated Israeli evacuation orders in recent days,"" the agency said, adding that medical staff, patients and some 117,000 internally displaced persons remain at the hospitals. The UNRWA said Tuesday three more of its workers were killed by strikes at home with their families in Gaza over the previous 24 hours; in all, 67 of its staff has been killed since Oct. 7. More than 670,000 displaced people are housed in about 150 UNRWA facilities in Gaza, the agency said, and it has no additional space to house the increasing number of people seeking shelter. More than 8,500 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Oct. 7, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, including more than 3,500 children — a number that exceeded the total number of children killed across the world's conflict zones each year since 2019, according to the humanitarian group Save the Children. Israel continues to deny that its current operation is a ""ground invasion,"" referring to it only as an ""expanded operation"" or a ""new phase"" in the war despite the continual presence of its troops in Gaza.  The operations are part of Israel's response to the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7, in which some 2,000 fighters flooded across Gaza's border into Israel and killed 1,400 people and kidnapped hundreds of othersOn Tuesday, Israel said it killed Nasim Abu Ajina, whom it described as a Hamas fighter who helped lead the Oct. 7 attacks. Abu Ajina ""directed"" the portion of the assault in two Israeli towns just north of Gaza, a statement from Israel's military said. Israel will not agree to a cease-fire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a press conference Monday, because in his view, that would equate to a ""surrender"" to Hamas. ""That will not happen in Gaza,"" Netanyahu said. He compared the calls for a Israeli cease-fire to asking the U. S. to cease hostilities after Sept. 11 or Pearl Harbor. Responding to those comments, the Palestinian ambassador to the U. N. , Riyad Mansour, called on the U. N. and the Security Council to ""stop the killing. "" ""There is no justification whatsoever to continue killing children, women, the elderly, the sick,"" Mansour told NPR, ""and to continue collectively punishing them by denying them electricity, water, medicine, food. ""The first priority should be to secure a cease-fire, he said, and then work out political issues. In recent days, the number of Hamas hostages reported by Israeli officials has increased, due to what officials describe as complications with identifying foreign citizens. The total number of hostages now stands at 240, Israel says. Five have so far been freed. At least 10 Americans are being held hostage by Hamas, officials say. And hundreds of American citizens remain trapped in Gaza. The U. S. has representatives in Doha participating in negotiations over the release of the hostages and the safe exit of Americans from Gaza, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been in ""close contact"" with Qatari officials in the effort, according to the State Department. Hamas controls the Gaza side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and has blocked foreign citizens from leaving, officials say. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Tuesday that he was aware of media reports that the gate at Rafah could be opened on Wednesday, but that he couldn't confirm those reports. ""I will say that we are intensely focused on getting the gate open, not just for one-way traffic of trucks coming in, but for American citizens and other foreign nationals"" getting out, he said. Blinken told a Senate committee on Tuesday that about 400 Americans and their families — or about 1,000 people — were trapped in Gaza and about 5,000 people from other countries were also trying to get out. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin testified to the committee on President Biden's supplemental funding request for Israel and Ukraine. Blinken will return to Israel on Friday for meetings with members of the Israeli government and plans to make other stops in the region, the State Department announced Tuesday evening. The secretary of State met with leaders in Israel and several Arab states in the days following the Oct. 7 attacks.  Also on Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Jack Lew's confirmation as ambassador to Israel, a post that had been open since the summer. Lew was Treasury secretary under President Barack Obama and was director of the Office of Management and Budget. He faced opposition from Senate Republicans because he worked on the controversial Iran nuclear deal in 2015. The vote was 52-42. Bill Chappell is based in Washington, D. C.

The stairway to the upper floor, now lacking a wall to support it, is leaning strangely. Pillars holding up the ceiling are bowing. Rubble is piled up outside. And through the holes in the floor, a man peers into the basement where Israeli security forces say Palestinian militants were storing weapons. The Israeli airstrike that destroyed the Al-Ansar Mosque in Jenin on Oct. 22 was an unusual occurrence for the occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces usually favor ground raids instead. At least two Palestinians were killed, officials in Jenin say. In the days since, Israeli security forces have mounted at least three raids on Jenin, all of them deadly. In total, at least 11 Palestinians have been killed in Jenin in just over a week, Palestinian officials say. Beyond Jenin, across the West Bank, Palestinians say that Israel has tightened restrictions and Israel's security forces have stepped up operations since the Gaza-based militant group Hamas launched attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,400 people. Israel says it is targeting militants and that its actions are necessary to counter what it calls terrorism. Most of Israel's fighting has focused on the Gaza Strip, where Hamas is based. Israel's military has killed more than 8,000 and injured more than 20,000 Palestinians in Gaza in the last three weeks, health officials in Gaza say. While Israeli raids are not new to Palestinians in the West Bank, they have stepped up since Oct. 7. From the start of 2023 through Oct. 6, 197 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank, according to an Associated Press tally. But since the start of the war, Israeli security forces have killed more than 100 Palestinians in the West Bank, Palestinian officials say, and 1,500 more have been arrested. For decades, Jenin and its densely populated refugee camp have been a place where Palestinian militants have been active. Over the years, militants from Jenin have carried out suicide bomb attacks and armed assaults on Israeli settlers. The mosque airstrike came after midnight on Oct. 22. When it hit, Noor Damaj was outside drinking tea with relatives in an unfinished apartment above his uncle's home, next door to the mosque. ""I wanted to go down and see what had happened to my family. I could not even get in,"" Damaj says. ""There was so much dust and gunpowder we could barely see. ""Rubble from the mosque had piled up against their home's exterior doors, he says, trapping them outside and other family members inside. It took an hour and a half to clear. No one in the family was injured, but there is enough damage that they are currently staying with family elsewhere in Jenin. Their home is so close to the mosque, says Damaj's aunt, Itaf Damaj, that she thought it impossible that Israelis hadn't known they were there. ""I am sure their planes have taken pictures of us. I am sure they know there are civilians living next to the mosque. But they didn't care,"" she says. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said the target of the strike was an ""underground terror compound"" at the mosque that was being used by members of Hamas and another militant group, Islamic Jihad. ""The mosque was used by the terrorists as a command center to plan the attacks and as a base for their execution,"" the military said, adding that it had received intelligence that one such attack was ""imminent. ""Local residents say the mosque had a basement and a tunnel that served as an emergency exit to an alleyway nearby. Asked how he felt about the presence of militants at the mosque, Noor Damaj answers simply: ""They are part of our society. "" More than 10,000 people live in the refugee camp, a part of Jenin packed with squat concrete houses and apartment buildings separated by steep, winding alleys. Most residents are descendants of Palestinian refugees from the conflict around the founding of the state of Israel in 1948, and object to the Israeli occupation that has lasted for decades. Israeli security forces have periodically raided the refugee camp. In July, hundreds of troops stormed the camp, backed by airstrikes. It was by far the largest operation in years that Israel had conducted in the West Bank. Things had grown relatively quiet since then, residents say — until last week. In quick succession came the Israeli airstrike, then a drone attack that killed three, and then another raid that left at least one Palestinian dead, according to Palestinian officials. On Monday, at least four Palestinians were killed by an Israeli aircraft as security forces carried out a fourth raid, officials from both Israel and the West Bank said. Israeli bulldozers dug up streets and dozens of Palestinians were arrested. Some residents are frightened. Around the corner from the mosque, Ma'in Zakarneh was asleep when the airstrike hit on Oct. 22. After a moment of shock, he and his wife rushed to gather their three young daughters and drive to a family member's home outside of town. ""All my daughters were crying, were panicking, were in a state of shock,"" he says. ""I felt like we were about to die. ""In July, Zakarneh told NPR he wanted to move to the U. S. to escape the violence, as his wife and one of their daughters are American citizens. They applied several years ago, they said, but their case hasn't gone anywhere yet. Now, they say, it feels even more urgent. Zakarneh's wife, Yasmin Radwan, sent an email to the State Department last week, begging for their case to be expedited. She showed NPR the email, in which she described their proximity to the airstrike and the ongoing violence. ""We are not living in [safety] and peace. Every day, we see militants walking around in the streets,"" she wrote. The problems in Jenin are difficult to solve, Zakarneh says. He has a good job, a nice house and a family to care for — but not everyone in the refugee camp has a life like that. Many of Jenin's residents are young, impoverished and unemployed. Just a few days after last week's airstrike on the mosque, an Israeli drone strike killed three young males in Jenin — two teenagers and a 20-year-old, according to witnesses. A fourth, another teenager, was killed in gun fighting that followed, witnesses said. Hours later, their blood was still on the ground. So too were scraps of metal: leftover pieces of the homemade explosive devices they were holding, witnesses said. ""During counterterrorism activity in the Jenin Camp, armed terrorists fired and hurled explosive devices at Israeli security forces,"" the Israeli military said in a short statement. ""In response, an IDF UAV struck the terrorists. Hits were identified. ""The strike hit just outside a cemetery where Palestinians killed by Israeli forces are buried. The cemetery is full, locals said. Those who died in last week's attacks were all buried at a new graveyard nearby. Last Wednesday afternoon, about 12 hours after the drone strike, a few mourners were lingering at the fresh graves. A 13-year-old boy named Tarik says the dead were friends of his brother. ""I'm very sad, because most of our friends have gone,"" he says. He personally wouldn't have held the homemade explosives, he says. But when asked what his future holds, he has only one answer: Muqawim, freedom fighter.

282,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/30/1209388876/dagestan-airport-riots-israel-palestine,"Russian police briefly closed an airport in Dagestan, a republic in Russia's far south, after hundreds of people stormed the grounds on Sunday, searching for a plane carrying passengers arriving from Tel Aviv. At least 20 people were injured at the airport in Makhachkala, the Dagestani capital, including nine police officers, the local interior ministry said in a statement posted to Telegram. Two people were hospitalized in grave condition. Roughly 60 people were arrested, with local officials vowing to open a criminal investigation to hold all rioters responsible. The airport had fully reopened as of Monday, but flights from Tel Aviv are to be temporarily rerouted to other cities, the Russian Aviation authority reported. Mediazona, an independent Russian media outlet, reported that the mob was responding to a flurry of messages on Telegram saying the plane arriving from Tel Aviv was carrying ""Jewish refugees. "" Several videos posted to social media on Sunday appear to show crowds surrounding planes on the tarmac. Some can be seen carrying Palestinian flags, shouting anti-Semitic phrases and roaming the terminal, asking arriving passengers to show their passports to verify their nationality, according to translations from news outlets like the Associated Press. In one video, the mob appears to confront an airport worker near a plane from the Russian operator Red Wings. The worker tells them the plane is empty and identifies himself as Muslim, The New York Times reported. In another, which appeared to be recorded inside the plane, a steward can be heard telling passengers to remain calm and to keep aircraft doors closed. ""There is an angry crowd,"" the voice says. ""It's quite possible that we will get caught. ""The riot unfolded as the Israeli military intensified ground operations in Gaza, part of its so-called ""second phase"" of the war with the militant group Hamas. As the death toll from the conflict continued to rise, tens of thousands of people gathered in New York City, London, Madrid, Casablanca, Istanbul, Islamabad and other cities over the weekend to take part in pro-Palestinian protests, calling for a cease-fire. Russian leaders, too, have called for a mediated end to the conflict, while tilting toward support of the Palestinians. For the Kremlin, fighting in the Middle East could also distract from Russia's own war in Ukraine. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said on Sunday that Israel ""expects the Russian law enforcement authorities to protect the safety of all Israeli citizens and Jews, wherever they may be. ""Dagestan is a predominantly Muslim republic in Russia's North Caucuses. Much of its Jewish population emigrated to Israel following the collapse of the Soviet Union, but family and business ties remain strong with the small Jewish community which remains. Messages from Dagestani leaders repeatedly expressed support for the Palestinians while still calling for calm. ""Federal authorities and international organizations are making every effort to bring about a cease-fire against Gaza civilians,"" read a statement from the regional government posted to Telegram. ""We urge residents of the republic not to succumb to the provocations of destructive groups and not to create panic in society. ""In a similar tone, the Kremlin on Monday blamed the riots on ""outside interference,"" with spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying bad actors from the West had spread information to divide Russians, according to a report from the Associated Press. Russian President Vladimir Putin will hold a meeting with top security officials to discuss the cause of the events, Peskov told reporters. RIA Novosti, a Russian state news agency, cited the Dagestan governor as saying the unrest was coordinated on Telegram by ""traitors"" based in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyy pointed to the riots as another example of Russia's aggressive brand of nationalism. ""This is not an isolated incident in Makhachkala, but rather part of Russia's widespread culture of hatred toward other nations, which is propagated by state television, pundits, and authorities,"" Zelenskyy wrote on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter.

283,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/30/1209380561/israel-presses-into-gaza-as-pro-palestinian-protests-spread-worldwide,"TEL AVIV, Israel — After a weekend in which hundreds of thousands of people worldwide took part in pro-Palestinian protests calling for an end to hostilities in Israel's conflict with the militant group Hamas, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that his country will not agree to a cease-fire. ""Just as the United States would not agree to a cease-fire after Pearl Harbor or after the terrorist attack of 9/11, Israel will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas after the horrific attacks of October 7,"" Netanyahu said, speaking in a press conference with foreign reporters. The calls for a cease-fire have come as an ""expansion"" of Israel's ground operations in Gaza pushed into a fourth day Monday. Officials have called the operation a ""second phase"" of the conflict. Since the intensified operation began on Friday night, Israeli airstrikes have hit more than 600 Hamas targets, including weapons depots and anti-tank missile launch sites, Israel said. Israeli troops killed dozens of Hamas fighters on Sunday alone, the Israeli military said. Statements from the Israeli military described several ""clashes"" between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters. Ground troops freed an Israeli soldier who being held hostage by Hamas, the Israeli military said. It is the first successful military operation to rescue a hostage by Israel in Gaza. Pvt. Ori Megidish had been kidnapped on Oct. 7, the day nearly 2,000 Hamas-led attackers stormed southern Israel and killed about 1,400 people.  Israel says 238 people are held hostage in Gaza, including 10 Americans. Five hostages have been freed. On Monday, Hamas released a video of three Israeli hostages and called on Netanyahu to make a deal to set free some 6,000 Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the hostages' release. It was not clear if the hostages had spoken under duress. Hamas has publicly stated it would accept such a deal. Israeli officials would not comment on the status of negotiations over a deal to free hostages. In Israel, Netanyahu has faced considerable political pressure over his handling of the conflict, including his limited contact with the families of people killed or taken hostage. And he is seen by critics as attempting to deflect responsibility for the deadliest attack on civilians in Israel's 75-year history. Late Saturday, Netanyahu posted a tweet that appeared to place blame for the intelligence failure on the heads of Israeli intelligence services, then deleted it and apologized. At a press conference Monday night, Netanyahu said he would not resign. ""The only thing that I intend to have resign is Hamas. We're going to resign them to the dustbin of history,"" Netanyahu said. About a thousand Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Friday, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, bringing the overall death toll there to more than 8,000. After two nights and a day of internet and phone service outages, Palestinian communications came back on Sunday. Across Gaza and beyond, Palestinians expressed relief as families were able to reach loved ones. Israel has continued to urge the evacuation of northern Gaza, including hospitals, where beds are completely full with injured people and hallways have crowded each night with Palestinians seeking refuge from airstrikes. At least a third of hospitals in Gaza have been forced to shut down due to a lack of fuel to operate generators, the U. N. says. At Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, hospital officials have evacuated displaced people, but staff are still treating patients, said Dr. Fadel Naim, an orthopedic surgeon working there. The hospital was the site of a deadly explosion on Oct. 17 that killed at least 100 people, according to estimates by U. S. intelligence services. ""They are trying to push the people to evacuate the hospital,"" Naim told NPR. ""They are still warning us. ""About 117 trucks carrying aid have been allowed into Gaza via the territory's Rafah border with Egypt. Most of those trucks have carried medical supplies, and about half have carried food. None have carried fuel, which Israel has blocked over concerns it could be stolen by Hamas. Food in Gaza has been difficult to come by. The lack of electricity and fuel for generators has put many food suppliers out of operation. Palestinians living in Gaza have told NPR about fruitless searches for open vendors or waiting in line for hours for a day's worth of bread for their family. On Saturday, thousands of people broke into several warehouses operated by UNRWA, the U. N. agency for Palestinian refugees, to steal wheat flour and other survival supplies. ""This is a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down after three weeks of war and a tight siege on Gaza. People are scared, frustrated and desperate,"" said Thomas White, UNRWA's top official for Gaza, in a statement Saturday. The pace of aid trucks crossing into Gaza is ""insufficient"" and ""geared to fail,"" he said. ""Very few trucks, slow processes, strict inspections, supplies that do not match the requirements of UNRWA and the other aid organizations, and mostly the ongoing ban on fuel, are all a recipe for a failed system,"" he said. Israel said Sunday it would resume water supply to central Gaza and authorize the Palestinian Water Authority to make repairs to pipelines damaged in the conflict. The U. N. reported that water supply in southern Gaza had experienced ""significant improvement"" in recent days as its agencies have delivered small amounts of fuel to desalination plants and pumping stations. Still, with much of Gaza's population of 2. 3 million people crowded into the territory's southern half, clean water remained challenging to acquire. ""We have been taking extreme measures to reserve whatever water we had left. For instance, showers are something of the past,"" said Abood Okal, a Palestinian-American and Massachusetts resident who was visiting family in Gaza when the war began and has since been stranded. He, his wife and 1-year-old son are sheltering in a home in southern Gaza with about 40 or so other people, he said. Members of the household have been walking to a filtration station every day to fill up a few gallons to bring home for everyone. Last Thursday, that filtration station ran out of diesel to operate its generators, Okal said Thursday evening. ""We are almost out of drinking water today. I think we have just enough to last us through tonight, then tomorrow we'll be basically out,"" he said. In New York, London, Madrid, Casablanca, Istanbul, Islamabad and other cities worldwide, tens of thousands of people took part in pro-Palestinian protests this past weekend, calling for a cease-fire. An airport in Russia's Muslim-majority region of Dagestan closed Sunday night after a pro-Palestinian mob stormed the airport as a flight from Tel Aviv arrived. Video posted to social media appeared to show a crowd on the tarmac surrounding the plane, which landed at the Makhachkala airport around 7:15 p. m. local time. ""All Dagestanis empathize with the suffering of victims of the actions of unrighteous people and politicians and pray for peace in Palestine. But what happened at our airport is outrageous and should receive an appropriate assessment from law enforcement agencies,"" said Sergey Melikov, head of the Dagestan Republic, in a post on Telegram.

Israeli raids on the Gaza Strip were intense overnight. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had struck more than 450 terror targets during the past day, and that Israeli forces continue to expand ground activities. It added that an IDF officer was severely injured by a mortar shell in the northern Gaza Strip. Speaking Sunday morning, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that ""fighting in the north of the Gaza Strip continues and expands . . . we will do what we must to achieve the goals of the war. ""Israeli attacks have killed at least 8,005 and injured more than 20,000 people in Gaza, including 3,324 children, the health ministry in Gaza said on Sunday. As the barrage continues, the Palestinian Red Crescent said on Sunday it  received warnings from Israeli authorities to immediately evacuate the al-Quds hospital in the Gaza Strip. ""Since this morning, there has been raids 50 meters away from the hospital,"" it added in a statement on Facebook. Israel declined to comment on the claims. Meanwhile, an official said Israel is aiming for a significant increase in aid to Gaza in the coming days, calling on Palestinian civilians to head to what he described as a ""humanitarian"" zone in the south of the territory. ""In the coming week we were planning to increase dramatically the amount of assistance"" headed for Gaza from Egypt, said Colonel Elad Goren of COGAT, the Israel Ministry of Defense agency that coordinates with the Palestinians. The White House said President Biden spoke with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi on Sunday. ""The two leaders committed to the significant acceleration and increase of assistance flowing into Gaza beginning today and then continuously,"" the White House said. A trickle of aid has been allowed to enter Gaza through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. Thirty-four trucks with food and medical supplies entered on Sunday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said, bringing the total to 118 since the start of the war. Aid groups say the total is a small fraction of what would normally cross into Gaza before the war. Biden also spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday and ""underscored the need to immediately and significantly increase the flow of humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of civilians in Gaza,"" the White House said. And after a communications blackout that lasted more than 30 hours, mobile and landline phone services and internet access are being restored, the Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Technology in Gaza said. A leading Palestinian communications company, the Paltel Group, says its phone and internet networks are gradually being restored. Virtually all communications went down Friday evening, around the time Israeli ground troops entered the northern part of Gaza. Meanwhile, Netanyahu, following backlash from Israeli politicians, was forced to delete an online statement saying that he'd had no warning of the Oct. 7 attack.

Ally is 21 years old and from New York.  ""My dad is a staunch Zionist. He said, 'You better not f***ing have gone to that protest. ' ""Ally has gone to many protests. ""He was like, 'I don't want to have you in my house right now. You are not welcome at this dinner table,' "" Ally said. Ally, who requested anonymity due to ongoing harassment, has family in Israel. Some are currently in the Israel Defense Forces. Since the Israel-Hamas war began, there have been protests demanding a cease-fire. Many Jewish Americans have joined in. Some say they've been met with hostility from within their own communities. Ally is a student at Columbia University, and is part of Jewish Voice For Peace, which is vocally demanding a cease-fire in Gaza. What Ally wants, beyond a cease-fire, is to address the human rights violations Palestinians have endured over the years. ""My position as a Jew is that it [has] always been our responsibility, according to our religion, to stand up for all those who are targeted, all those who are oppressed, all those who are facing violence. Because as a people, we've been persecuted for so long. ""Rabbi Ari-Lev Fornari, also with Jewish Voice for Peace, says lately, he's been hearing about a lot of arguments like the one at Ally's Shabbat dinner table. ""I don't know a single person in my community who hasn't had a fight with a family member in the last two weeks,"" Fornari says.  He says some of these disagreements are generational. While diverse in participation, groups like Jewish Voice for Peace skew young, reflecting a shift in Jewish American political views. They also reflect the Israeli government's move to the far right, something which feels incompatible to many young liberal Jews. According to the Pew Research Center, around half of Jewish Americans 65 and over say Israel is an essential part of their Jewish identity. For Jews 29 and under, that number goes down to 35%. Arno Rosenfeld writes for The Forward, a Jewish-American publication. He says, ""the mainstream Jewish community has really unified behind a single message of solidarity with Israel and support for a military response to Hamas. And so really the only release valve for American Jews who are opposed to that or who are calling for a cease-fire, are these youth-led movements. ""Rosenfeld also says a lot of liberal Jewish people are feeling a sense of ""political homelessness,"" as their synagogues seem to have abandoned concerns for Palestinian civilians. In the last few weeks, Ally has felt this sense of placelessness. ""I mean, I've been spit on on campus for wearing a Keefyeh. I have received multiple death threats. And it gets very scary because the places where I'm supposed to feel safe to practice my faith and my culture on campus are now places where I'm not welcome,"" Ally says. A lot of this is playing out online, where there is vitriol but also silence. Various Jewish people NPR spoke to shared a concern that expressing opposing beliefs would translate into serious real-life consequences. Essie, a Jewish teenager in the Bay Area, who asked that her last name be withheld for fear of retaliation, says she's wondered, as she applies to colleges, what the impact of speaking up will be. She recently tweeted in support of high schoolers who staged a Pro-Palestine protest. That tweet went viral. She says she finds it amusing, and a sign of the times, that a post saying her high school friends who attended the protest were in no way hostile to her, garnered so much attention. ""I didn't think it was that big of a controversial statement,"" Essie says. ""It makes me sad that we can't have these conversations without people getting defensive. But I think that everyone is reacting out of pain. "" Many Jews say it is indeed painful to see a Jewish person protesting against Israel at this time. Lisa Harris Glass, CEO of Rutgers Hillel, a Jewish campus organization at Rutgers University, also feels that there is a generational issue at play. ""I was born in the 1960s. We were really being raised by the post-Holocaust generation,"" she says. Glass has a daughter, around Ally's age. ""I remember giving birth to my daughter. And holding her in my arms. I'm thinking there are people who want to murder her because she exited my Jewish womb,"" Glass says. ""But she is born a target. That's what it means to be Jewish. We have to care what happens to Israel. Because it's like . . . your safety net. ""Although there is a generational shift, many young Jewish Americans see Israel as inextricable from their identity. Kaitlin Pollack, a high schooler in Long Island, says she believes ""the entire foundation of the Jewish faith is quite literally based on Israel. It's where our heritage is. I have so much family there, so many friends living there. "" Pollack, who is 17 and also applying for colleges,  says she's watching anti-Israel protests closely. She feels they promote antisemitism. ""I'd say the majority of people I know are living with a wake-up call to the impossibility of being a Jew in 2023,"" says Rabbi David Ingber, founding rabbi of Romemu, which says it's the largest Renewal synagogue in the United States. ""The impossibility of both demanding that people care when we get slaughtered, and the shock of how quickly the center of gravity shifted towards context, apologies, for what took place,"" he says. Ingber expresses grief at the death of civilians. He also echoes the position of many Jewish Americans: That Israel is defending itself, and therefore Jewish people as a whole. And this is the fundamental disagreement with Jewish activist groups protesting against Israel. Rabbi Ari Lev Fornari, from Jewish Voice for Peace, says there's nothing inherently antisemitic about criticizing Israel's actions, about expressing outrage of over 7,7oo people being killed in Gaza, as reported by Gaza's Ministry of Health. ""If you told me to boil down, like, what is Judaism about,"" Fornari says, ""I would tell you tikkun olam. It means it means the repair of the world. I don't want to be part of a Judaism that is being used, taken in my name, to kill and occupy and imprison millions of Palestinians. ""He says protesters like him understand Jewish existential fear.

287,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/28/1209243034/israeli-troops-remain-in-gaza-marking-significant-escalation-of-conflict,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli troops remained on the ground in the Gaza Strip Saturday as part of what military officials have described as an ""expansion"" of ground operations, marking a significant escalation in Israel's war with the militant group Hamas that began earlier this month. For the last several days, the Israel Defense Forces had mounted a series of limited incursions into Gaza, in which soldiers left soon after entering. But Saturday's announcement was the first extended presence of Israeli troops in the territory. In a televised press conference on Saturday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the escalation that began on Friday marked ""the second stage"" of the campaign and said Israelis should anticipate ""a difficult and long war. ""He called Israel's battle against Hamas the nation's ""second war of independence. ""For the first time since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack, the prime minister took questions from reporters. He fended off questions about his responsibility for the country's security failure that day — saying that would be investigated after the war. Israeli troops entered from northern Gaza, among them ground troops, armor and artillery, military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said at a press briefing Saturday morning. ""Expanding the operation serves all the war's goals,"" Hagari said. Footage released by the Israeli military appeared to show tanks entering along the beach on Gaza's north end. The ground operation was supported by ""very significant, massive attacks from the sea"" and heavy air bombardment, he said. As part of the assault, Israeli officials said soldiers ""neutralized"" terrorist cells and directed air forces to destroy the building site of a Hamas operational meeting point. In a statement, Hamas called the operation a ""failure"" and said Israel took heavy losses. An Israeli military spokesperson said Israel had no casualties in Friday night's fighting. Neither claim could be independently confirmed. IDF fighter jets struck 150 underground targets across the northern Gaza Strip, officials said, killing a number of Hamas operatives. Among those killed was Asem Abu Rakaba, the IDF said, describing him as an official who had helped to plan the Oct. 7 attack in which hundreds of Hamas fighters flooded across Gaza's border and killed more than 1,400 civilians and soldiers in Israel. Abu Rakaba was responsible for the drones and paragliders used by Hamas that day, an IDF statement said. ""Their death and assassination leads to a good advancement in the war's stages and allows the forces on the ground to battle a weaker enemy,"" Hagari added. The intensifying military operations took place amid a near-total outage of internet and phone service in Gaza, which began around sunset Friday. Multiple aid groups, including the International Committee of the Red Cross and the World Health Organization, reported difficulty contacting local staff in Gaza. ""We are still out of touch with our staff and health facilities. I'm worried about their safety,"" said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of WHO, in a Saturday post on the social media site X, previously known as Twitter. NPR was also unable to reach local staff in Gaza. The U. N. 's top humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories said they had only been able to reach staff in Gaza via satellite phone. The intensifying conflict paired with the communications challenges sparked widespread concern about deteriorating conditions in Gaza. More than 1. 4 million people in Gaza are displaced from their homes, the U. N. estimates. Shortages of food, water, fuel and electricity were already severe, aid groups had reported. Hospitals are overrun with patients injured in airstrikes, and at night, their hallways fill with people trying to take shelter from airstrikes. ""Even some of the doctors' medical staffs, they are saying, what is the benefit of the help that we are doing now? We are not able to help patients anymore. We cannot do anything for them,"" said Dr. Mohamad Matar, who spoke to NPR Friday before the blackout. Fewer than 100 trucks of aid have been allowed into Gaza since the conflict began. Israel said Saturday it would allow more trucks to enter through Gaza's southern border with Egypt — but warned that the aid would only be available to people in the southern half of the territory. ""Whoever will be in this area, which is a protected area, will receive food, water and medicine,"" Hagari said. Israel has repeatedly struck southern Gaza, including the densely populated areas of Khan Younis and Rafah, with airstrikes. In the English-language video message posted to social media, Hagari repeated the Israeli military's frequent calls for residents to evacuate northern Gaza. ""Your window to act is closing,"" he said. ""Move south for your own safety. This is not a mere precaution. It is an urgent plea. ""It was unclear how Gaza residents would hear the warning since internet and other communications in the enclave have been cut off. On Saturday, health officials in Gaza said that more than 7,700 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes. Israeli officials said 230 hostages are still being held in Gaza by Hamas. On Saturday night, Netanyahu took a meeting with a group of families of hostages and other missing people, who had demanded assurances from Israel's war cabinet that the expanded operation would not endanger the lives of the hostages. During the two-hour meeting, the group said that an ""all-for-all"" deal would receive major national support, referring to all Palestinian prisoners held by Israel — of which there are more than 5,000, according to Israeli human rights group B'Tselem  — for all hostages held in Gaza. Hamas claims 50 hostages have already been killed by Israeli airstrikes. Hamas said it would be open to such a deal. In response, Netanyahu told the families the abductees would not be ignored, according to a statement from the group, which is called the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum. ""We will utilize and exhaust every possibility to bring them home,"" the prime minister told the group. ""It is an integral part of the goals for the operations as we have defined them. This is not mere lip service. ""The group was angry that Israeli officials failed to inform them about how their relatives would be protected ahead of the public announcement of the intensified assault. ""This night was the most terrible of all nights. It was a long and sleepless night, against the backdrop of the major IDF operation in the Strip, and absolute uncertainty regarding the fate of the hostages held there, who were also subject to the heavy bombings,"" said Liat Bell Sommer, a spokesperson for the group. In the wake of Israel's expanded air and ground attacks in Gaza, pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched in several major cities in the U. S. and in Europe on Saturday to demand a cease-fire in the region. In New York, a protest that drew thousands of people forced a shutdown of the Brooklyn Bridge, a day after another pro-Palestinian rally led to the temporary closure of Grand Central Terminal. Crowds in San Francisco chanted and waved Palestinian flags during a three-hour march that began at the city's ferry building and later blocked all lanes of a section of Highway 101. A London protest organized by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign passed by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Downing Street office and concluded outside the Houses of Parliament. Like Washington, the British government has so far resisted calls for a cease-fire and said that Israel has a right to defend itself after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.

Seven members of the family were killed. Hejazi's arm was crushed and her legs were broken and badly burned, but she was alive. She told her husband, Asad, to leave her to die. But somehow they pulled her out from the rubble. An ambulance rushed her to the Nasser Hospital in the city of Kahn Yunis, in southern Gaza. The hospital was crowded and chaotic when she arrived. The baby had to be delivered if there was any hope it would survive. Even though the hospital had no electricity, Dr. Mohammad Qandeel decided they needed to do an emergency cesarean section. Cell phones illuminated the operating table while the medical team worked, Dr. Qandeel says. ""We have no water – I don't have water to wash my hands,"" he recalls. There were also no antibiotics to fight infections. On a day with so much death a baby girl was born. They named her Mariam – after her husband's sister – one of the family members who died in the airstrikes. Dr. Qandeel says Raneem Hejazi's story is – tragically – not unique. In fact, her emergency C-section was one of two that night at Nasser Hospital. ""The babies are ok – thank God – and the mothers are in the ICU facing severe devastating injuries,"" he says. They aren't equipped to properly care for the women at the hospital, given the lack of resources, so they are trying to facilitate their transfer to Egypt. ""If they stay in the ICU without evacuation they will also face death soon. "" ""We have hundreds of severely injured patients, 70% of them are women and children,"" he says. Hospital staff  are often working without electricity or water. ""Every day is horrible,"" he says. Even for pregnant women who aren't injured, the situation in Gaza is horrific, says Dominic Allen, the U. N. Population Fund's representative in East Jerusalem. ""As a population fund, which focuses on reproductive health as part of our mandate, our big concern is the 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza right now,"" Allen says. Many of these pregnant women are fleeing their homes, trying to find safe places to stay, he says. ""Every time you're moving, you're dodging bombs and airstrikes, with that pressure and stress of not only trying to find safety in that moment but to think ahead to – am I going to be able to give birth in a safe environment? And – what's the world I'm bringing my unborn child into?""He adds that his U. N. agency is distributing medical supplies and hygiene kits for women, including items like sanitary towels. It's also supporting a helpline for women and youth. But Ammal Awadallah, the executive director of the Palestinian Family Planning and Protection Association, says it's unclear how many pregnant women can reach helplines given the lack of electricity and internet. Hospitals are far from a haven. She says hospitals are telling pregnant women they can't receive care unless they are fully dilated and ready to deliver. And their stay will be short. ""With the overcrowded hospitals, women and their newborns are being dismissed only a few hours after delivery,"" Awadallah says. Hospitals are overwhelmed  with people injured from airstrikes. And for families whose homes have been destroyed, there's nowhere to go after leaving the hospital. One of Allen's colleagues is a reproductive health specialist on the ground in Gaza. ""She is receiving phone calls from pregnant or new mothers and they're asking some of the most basic questions around – my child's been born, I don't have access to clothes, what do I wrap my baby in?"" Allen says. A major concern is access to clean water, he says. Mothers who are breastfeeding need to drink extra water to be able to produce milk for their babies. ""What we're hearing is that, as water is running out, the only water is in small quantities [and] it's brackish, unhygienic water,"" he says. He says his staff spoke with a woman with a seven- or eight-month-old child who had been nursing but whose milk supply had dried up. Allen echoes the U. N. Secretary General's call for a humanitarian ceasefire. For Raneem Hejazi, Mariam's mother, there's a long road ahead. Her arm was amputated in a six-hour surgery. She remains in the hospital and will need more surgeries. Asad visits her and their newborn every day. Doctors tell her family that she needs to go to Egypt to get better care than the hospitals in Gaza can give. So far, the borders are closed, and no one is getting out.

289,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/27/1208445765/israel-palestine-cultural-fallout,"In recent years, social media backlash has become commonplace as cultural figures and organizations use digital platforms to express their views in response to world events. But some have also been facing real-world consequences — fallout that goes well beyond the realm of social media — for making public declarations about the present Israel-Hamas conflict. In the world of talent management, Maha Dakhil at the high profile Creative Artists Agency, who represents Tom Cruise, Natalie Portman and Madonna among other A-listers, resigned from the agency's internal board last Sunday after posting a series of anti-Israeli comments on social media. Dakhil also stepped down from co-leading CAA's motion pictures department. Then, on Tuesday, Dakhil's outspoken stance on the war caused one of the agency's top clients, West Wing and Social Network creator Aaron Sorkin, to ditch CAA and return to his former agency William Morris Endeavor. ""Maha isn't an antisemite,"" Sorkin said in a statement to NPR. ""She's just wrong. ""Dakhil isn't the only powerful Hollywood agent to experience fallout from speaking out about the conflict. On Thursday, Kitty Laing, United Agents' head of comedy, stepped down from her role on the agency's executive committee as a result of her anti-Israel social media posts. (However, Laing will continue to work with her client list. )And the real-world fallout from speaking out about the war isn't just happening in Hollywood. There are fractures appearing across the cultural landscape. At least two 92NY (92nd Street Y) employees resigned after the famed New York cultural center did not go forward with a scheduled appearance by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Viet Thanh Nguyen and put the remainder of its poetry reading season on hold. Nguyen was among the 700-plus writers who signed an open letter published in the London Review of Books calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. ""I have no regrets about anything I have said or done in regards to Palestine, Israel, or the occupation and war,"" the author posted on Instagram. And on Thursday, David Velasco, editor-in-chief of ArtForum was ousted by its parent company, Penske Media Corporation, a few days after the international visual art magazine published an open letter calling for an end to violence against civilians in the conflict and humanitarian aid to Gaza. The initial letter did not condemn the Hamas attack on Israel. It was later revised.  Then, on Friday and Saturday, several ArtForum staffers announced their resignations, including Associate Editor Kate Sutton, and Senior Editors Zack Hatfield and Chloe Wyma. ""The firing of David Velasco violates everything I had cherished about the magazine and makes my work there untenable,"" Wyma posted on X (formerly Twitter). At the same time, choosing not to speak out is bringing about similar pitfalls, as the Writers Guild of America (WGA) recently discovered. The union, which represents Hollywood screenwriters, issued a response on Tuesday to a letter sent by more than 300 of its members, including Jerry Seinfeld, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, and Homeland's Gideon Raff, asking why the WGA had failed to make a statement condemning Hamas' attack against Israel. The WGA's eventual statement to its members, published in full by Variety, called Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel ""an abomination"" and explained why it had not initially issued a public statement about the conflict. The union denied ""masking hateful views"" and being ""paralyzed by factionalism,"" and said it was ""humbled by the magnitude of this conflict. ""But the WGA's explanation has not stopped some writers from questioning their union membership, or in the case of at least one writer, letting it go. Dan Gordon, who co-wrote Wyatt Earp with Kevin Costner and The Hurricane with Denzel Washington, resigned his WGA membership on Tuesday, calling the union's lack of a statement ""appalling. ""All of this comes at a time when much of the public expects and even favors cultural figureheads who speak out about world events. Nearly half of the 2,000-plus people who responded last week to a poll by the Hollywood Reporter said it is ""very appropriate"" or ""somewhat appropriate"" for a celebrity to speak out about the Israel-Hamas conflict. Less than one third said they didn't think it was appropriate, while a quarter had no opinion on the matter. ""There's a growing sense that as a publicly visible figure you also carry a social and political responsibility that comes with the attention capital you possess, and which can be converted into political influence and discursive power,"" said Sandra Mayer, a literary and cultural historian based at the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and co-editor of the recently published anthology Authorship, Activism and Celebrity. ""With the rise of social media in the past 15-20 years, the apparent leveling of public discourse, and the growth of opportunities of interaction between prominent public figures and ordinary citizens, there is a greater pressure for such individuals to speak out and to take advantage of the privileges and opportunities their status affords them. ""Mayer said because of the ""contentious and extremely emotionalized"" nature of this particular conflict, it's not surprising that both speaking out and remaining silent has been landing cultural figures and groups in trouble. But she said celebrities will probably continue to use their platforms to share their opinions about this war — and other issues — regardless of the consequences. ""It is probably too early to tell how and to what extent this will affect the future of celebrity stand-taking,"" Mayer said. ""But I don't think we can expect celebrities to become less vocal in the future. """,npr_articles/article_289.txt,npr_results/article_289.txt.json
290,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/27/1209099096/israel-hamas-war-us-military,"U. S. military advisers recently dispatched to Israel in advance of a possible incursion into Gaza include a Marine special operations commander with experience in urban warfare, in places like Fallujah and the fight against ISIS in the Iraqi city of Mosul. The two militaries have a history of collaboration. ""The relationship between the Israeli Special Operations Forces and U. S. Special Operations Command has been longstanding. It's very robust,"" said retired Marine Gen. Mark Schwartz, former deputy commander of U. S. joint special operations who served as U. S. Security Coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority from 2019 to 2021. Schwartz said the Israelis have long experience dealing with Gaza — there's even a mock city, over half-a-mile square, used for training in the Negev desert. But he's concerned that with the size of the force preparing to enter Gaza, most will be new at this. ""The vast majority of those forces that have been activated, they've never served in Lebanon, they didn't serve the last time an incursion happened in Gaza. And as they're putting their lives at risk, trying to deal with urban room clearing. These young men and women are having to make split-second decisions on 'who do I shoot or do I not shoot' based on who they find in a room and the threat that they perceive,"" he said. American generals sent to Israel may be able to offer some lessons from their own struggle to mitigate civilian casualties after two decades of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. And the U. S. may have intelligence about specific technology that Hamas may have obtained from Iran – which spent years helping militants in Iraq build booby traps and mines to attack American troops.  But having a high-level liaison to Israel also allows for two-way communication. ""The bigger role would be to liaise with Israel to make sure that Israeli military operations are anticipated by the United States,"" said Dan Byman, author of A High Price: The Triumphs and Failures of Israeli Counterterrorism. ""We're also seeing an array of militant groups, many of which are tied to Iran, attacking not only Israeli but also U. S. forces. Military operations by Israel could excite these, whether it's an operation that kills large numbers of civilians or simply something that changes the status quo,"" said Byman. The U. S. may need to prepare bases in the region for any backlash, and even prepare its own response, as it did this week against Iranian forces in Syria. Having this ongoing high level cooperation can help the U. S. sway Israel — as it may have already done to delay the ground invasion, said Byman. ""Part of the Biden administration's approach has been to hug Israel quite tightly as a way of saying to Israelis, America is behind you, but also giving Israelis the willingness to trust the United States. And I think should military operations go into overdrive during a ground invasion, the United States could offer suggestions, could to push for course corrections that other countries simply would not be trusted [to give],"" said Byman.  That may mean course corrections like the one the U. S. slowly made in Iraq and Afghanistan, especially regarding protecting civilians, said Gen. Schwartz. The Israeli military is obligated by the laws of war to protect civilians in Gaza, but it's also in their interest, he said. ""Well, if you want to have any opportunity to try to leverage human intelligence to find out where the hostages are located, you certainly want to mitigate the pain and suffering on the civilian populace and, candidly I think Israel's failed in that,"" said Schwartz. That's the kind of candid appraisal that might just be heeded from a high-ranking U. S. military official working closely with Israel, he adds.

291,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/27/1209084199/israel-military-expanding-operations-gaza-hamas-communications-internet,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Ahead of a possible ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military announced that its forces were ""expanding"" ground activities in Gaza Friday night as the besieged territory was plunged into a communications and internet blackout. The announcement comes as Israel's military has increased its bombing campaign in Gaza to target what it says is underground infrastructure used by Palestinian militant groups, including Hamas, whose deadly attack on Israel Oct. 7 sparked the current conflict. Tens of thousands of Israeli soldiers are stationed around Gaza's borders, and in recent days, Israeli tanks and troops have entered Gaza for limited incursions, supported by heavy airstrikes and artillery. ""In continuation of the raids we have carried out in the last few days, the ground forces are expanding their activity this evening,"" said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces. He repeated Israel's call for Palestinians to flee to southern Gaza where conditions, he said, would be ""safer. "" A heightened pace and intensity of operations could pave the way for the much-expected Israeli ground invasion of Gaza. A large-scale invasion would likely mark a significant and deadly turning point in a war that has already seen more than 1,400 dead in Israel and 7,300 dead in Gaza, according to respective officials. In an interview on Fox News, Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said that Hamas is ""feeling now Israel's might. """"We are beefing up the pressure on Hamas. We're increasing the pressure that they're under. Our military operations are underway,"" Regev said. When NPR asked if Friday's operation marked a new phase in the war, Regev replied, ""No comment. ""Phone calls and text messages to and from Gaza had sputtered around sundown Friday. Paltel, a major Palestinian telecommunications company, announced that a barrage of airstrikes had cut key communications infrastructure. ""The intense bombing in the last hour caused the destruction of all remaining international routes linking Gaza to the outside world,"" the company said in a statement on the social media site X. Aid groups said they had lost contact with their teams on the ground in Gaza, and decried the great risk to civilians, health workers and other noncombatants. ""Hospitals & humanitarian operations can't continue without communications, energy, food, water, meds,"" Lynn Hastings, the United Nations' humanitarian coordinator in Gaza, wrote on X. ""We are deeply concerned about the ability of our teams to continue providing their emergency medical services, especially since this disruption affects the central emergency number '101' and hinders the arrival of ambulance vehicles to the wounded and injured,"" the Palestinian Red Crescent Society wrote on X. In response to the blackout, Hamas accused Israel of an ""intention to commit more massacres and genocides away from the eyes of the press and the world.

292,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/27/1208836319/israel-hamas-islamic-jihad-militants-videos-details,"Editor's note: This story contains graphic descriptions of violence. KIBBUTZ BE'ERI, Israel — Who were the militants who swept in from Gaza to southern Israel on Oct. 7 and killed more than 1,400 men, women and children?Some of them spray painted their names and the names of militias in blue, brown and green letters on the outside walls of a home they ravaged. Some of them videotaped their brutality wearing body cameras. Nearly 2,000 people attacked 29 different locations, including residential communities and army bases, Israel says. Many of them returned to Gaza — estimated to have taken nearly 230 hostages back with them. But hundreds of Hamas fighters were killed, and dozens were detained, by Israeli forces. As Israeli bombardments on the Gaza Strip continue, which Gaza health officials say have claimed the lives of more than 7,000 Palestinians, new details are emerging about the men who carried out the brutal violence in Israel that sparked the current war. They were young. They were well-trained. They had specific orders. They had a mix of motivations, tied to the unique conditions and ideologies that permeate life in Gaza. And their mass killings, kidnappings and brutality have forever changed the lives of Israelis and Palestinians. Among the throngs who crossed into Israel on Oct. 7 was a 25-year-old man named Mohammed. In an interview with NPR, his neighbor in Gaza said Mohammed had led an ordinary life. He didn't finish his high school matriculation exam. He worked as a taxi driver, had a big wedding party with family and friends, and started a business selling food products. Everyone in the family and neighborhood knew he belonged to the militant wing of Islamic Jihad, a smaller Palestinian militia in Gaza that is closely aligned with Iran. Mohammed disappeared on the day of the attacks, his neighbor said. His family only discovered what happened the next day, when a fellow militant returned from Israel back to Gaza with Mohammed's cellphone and personal effects, and told Mohammed's family what had happened. He said Mohammed had made it a mile or two inside Israel when an Israeli aircraft shot him — five bullets to the chest, one near the neck — and recited the shahada, Islam's affirmation of faith, before he died from his wounds. ""May God be merciful with him,"" his father told NPR. ""To be a martyr is a huge thing, and this is what he pursued. I hope God accepts him as a martyr. ""Both his neighbor and his father spoke on condition of anonymity, and referred to Mohammed only by his first name, out of concern Israel could target them. What motivated the attacks on Oct. 7 is a hotly debated topic. A senior Hamas official told NPR the group staged the attack to draw attention to Israel's punishing restrictions on the Gaza Strip. Other Hamas leaders say they took hostages hoping for a grand prisoner exchange to free Palestinians in Israeli jails. ""We want to get the attention of the world,"" said Ghazi Hamad, a member of Hamas' political bureau. ""Please, look at the Palestinians. We are under oppression and torture and collective punishment all the time. This is our message to the world. ""Israeli officials say it's an ideology of hate against Jews and Israel that is dominant. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Hamas ""worse than ISIS. "" Israel, the United States and other countries recognize Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad group as terrorists. Harel Chorev, a Palestinian affairs expert at the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Tel Aviv University, says Hamas' goal is to break down Israeli society, which it sees as a colonialist people without real roots in the land. ""They always believe that all of us should go back to Germany and Poland and whatever, even if we are from Morocco,"" Chorev says. ""It's really to break our spirit. ""There is Gaza's history: Most Palestinians there descend from refugees uprooted from their homes in Israel's founding war 75 years ago. Failed rounds of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have driven support for what Palestinians call armed resistance to Israeli occupation and brutality against the population. There is Israel's strict policy toward Gaza, leading to a travel and economic blockade on the territory for the last 16 years. Israel says this is to contain attacks by Hamas after it took over Gaza in 2007 from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, now based solely in the occupied West Bank. Netanyahu's longtime policy was to preserve this political division between the territories to prevent them from uniting into one Palestinian state. There is also the reality of daily life: Most in Gaza are poor, and most young people are without a job. Not every young Palestinian belongs to Hamas, but militant groups offer a steady salary, and shape a worldview, experts say. ""I'm not a radical Muslim, but [for] those who belong to Hamas, I think it becomes part of the socialization process, part of the education process . . . hating the Jews or hating Israel as an occupier,"" says Palestinian political analyst Mkhaimar Abusada, who is in Gaza. ""That probably explains the brutality that took place on the 7th of October. ""There are around 20,000 to 25,000 militants in Hamas' Qassam militant wing, according to Gaza experts Samir Ghattas of the Cairo-based Middle East Forum for Strategic Studies and National Security, and Harel Chorev of Tel Aviv University. They estimate about 5,000 to 6,000 belong to Islamic Jihad's Al-Quds Brigades. Taken together, it's a small share of Gaza's population of more than 2 million, but a significant force. In the Kibbutz Be'eri massacre, spacious homes were torn apart: kitchens turned upside down; Rummikub game tiles and an elderly man's walker strewn over the floors. In one house the smell of a blood-soaked mattress lingers. Israel's army says it collected terabytes of footage of the attacks from GoPro cameras retrieved from Gaza militants, as well as victims' cellphones and neighborhood security cameras. The military posted some of the raw footage online, and showed 43 minutes of some of the more explicit videos to foreign media, including NPR. The videos show both methodical and erratic behavior. At Be'eri, gunmen waited for a car to approach and open the kibbutz's main gate, before shooting the driver and infiltrating the community. The videos also capture the men's heavy breathing, nervous pacing and shouted instructions. In one of the most gruesome scenes screened to foreign media, a man calls out for a knife and calls to cut off a wounded man's head, before attempting to behead him with a garden hoe. The military says some of the perpetrators were found to be under the influence of narcotics. Human Rights Watch said it verified four videos of attacks by Hamas-led gunmen and called for the attacks to be investigated as war crimes. Ghattas, the Gaza expert in Cairo, believes elite combatants in Gaza traveled on false passports to countries like Lebanon or Iran where they learned the combat methods of the Iran-backed militia Hezbollah. He believes they returned to Gaza to train the squads who carried out the attacks. The Israeli army wouldn't elaborate on the question of foreign training, but asserts there was Iranian involvement. Iran denies there was prior coordination. Israel has released images of pamphlets the military says it found with the Hamas fighters — containing detailed attack and abduction plans — and has released interrogation videos of several of the attackers it has detained. In the videos, the men claim their orders were to kill, and to take many hostages back to Gaza. One claimed those who took hostages were promised $10,000 and an apartment. The Israeli military released a recording it says was a phone call — placed during the attack — from one of the attackers to his family back in Gaza. ""Your son killed Jews,"" the voice says. ""Ten with my own hands, mom!""""Oh my son, may God protect you,"" a woman's voice answers in tears. ""Enough. Come back, come back,"" a man's voice says. ""What do you mean come back?"" the son says. ""There is no coming back. It's either martyrdom or victory. ""Was the son killed or detained in Israel? Did he return to his family in Gaza? Israel's military declined comment. What we know is that his family, like every other family in Gaza and Israel, now faces the consequences of yet another war.",npr_articles/article_292.txt,npr_results/article_292.txt.json
293,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/27/1208851845/americans-in-gaza-feel-abandoned-by-their-government,"In the first few days of the war between Israel and Hamas, American mother and Massachusetts resident Wafaa Abuzayda spoke to Morning Edition from Gaza with a plea to the U. S. government. ""Please, save us,"" she said. More than two weeks into the war, she, her husband and their one-year-old baby are still trapped in the besieged Palestinian enclave. They are among an estimated 600 U. S. citizens trapped in the Gaza Strip, along with more than a thousand others who hold European passports. They're trapped alongside more than 2. 3 million Palestinians who don't hold foreign passports. All of them live under constant Israeli bombardment with no way to escape. Abuzayda and her husband, Abood Okal, are running out of food and clean water. They just ran out of milk for the baby, Yousef. The other day, the family had no choice but to drink salt water from a well to stay hydrated. Over the last two weeks, the family has updated Morning Edition on their struggle to get out. Four times, they've waited at the Rafah border crossing into Egypt under instruction from the State Department that this may be their chance to escape. Each time, the gate into Egypt remained closed to them. ""The way that American citizens are being treated in Gaza is just a shame on this government and on the State Department, with all its mighty power and influence,"" Okal told Morning Edition in a voice message from the border crossing. Okal, Abuzayda and their baby have been sleeping ten minutes away from the crossing so they can rush over. They're crowded in a single-family home with around 40 people – approximately 10 are U. S. citizens. But even this far south, miles away from the northern border with Israel, it's not safe. Israeli airstrikes have hit the border crossing itself at least four times. In a voice message last Thursday, Abuzayda told us that just two minutes earlier, the house next door had been bombed. ""Yousef was sleeping next to the window, literally next to the window, and the window broke,"" Abuzayda said. ""We're not safe here because we heard the ground invasion is coming at any moment. I don't know what to say. ""Israeli drones buzz in the background of almost all these voice memos. It is what they hear all day and night, along with the booms of the airstrikes. Okal says he fears the day will come that they get hit. ""All it takes is one missile, one airstrike to miss its target or be too close to where you are,"" Okal said. ""That has happened before. ""Since the Hamas attack that killed at least 1,400 Israelis, the majority of them civilians, more than 7,000 Palestinians have been killed in retaliatory Israeli airstrikes, according to the health ministry in Gaza. Upward of 2,700 of the dead are children.  ""We're trying to stay strong, but we cannot help but feel hopeless and abandoned,"" Okal said. They've been begging for help from the State Department for more than two weeks. Their Boston-based lawyer, Sammy Nabulsi, has also been in touch with the State Department since the war broke out. He refuted Secretary of State Antony Blinken's recent claim on CBS's Face the Nation that Hamas was blocking the exit for American citizens stuck in Gaza. When Okal has waited at the border, the only officials he's seen on the ground have been Egyptian officials on the other side saying they can't cross. On Thursday, Abuzayda and Okal got another message from the State Department, telling them the department was continuing its work to get them out and get more humanitarian aid in. But they had no update on when the Rafah crossing might open for them. To send Morning Edition his latest round of voice messages, Okal stood in an open field. It is the only place he can find cell reception, and even this act is a risk. His wife and other family members are afraid he will be targeted, misidentified as a militant. ""Even making a phone call is becoming extremely dangerous,"" Okal said. Meanwhile, Abuzayda and Okal are looking for ways to distract Yousef from the wrath of war. Okal said a kitten showed up at their doorstep on Wednesday, just after a round of airstrikes hit 800 or 900 feet from their house, they estimate. They took the kitten in and called it Milka, after Yousef's favorite chocolate. Yousef loves animals – the family has a dog back home in Medway, Massachusetts named Lily. Okal said the kitten calmed the baby after the panic of the nearby airstrike. ""It's almost like angels are looking after us,"" Okal said. ""We hope they continue to do so.

294,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/27/1208575570/irans-foreign-minister-armed-groups-are-poised-with-their-finger-on-the-trigger,"Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian says groups allied with Iran are prepared to strike if Israel's war against Hamas continues. In an interview with Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep that took place in New York City, Amir-Abdollahian said he had met with ""leaders of the resistance in Lebanon and also Palestinian groups"" in recent weeks and heard of plans that are ""more powerful and deeper than what you've witnessed. """"If this situation continues, and women and children and civilians are still killed in Gaza and the West Bank, anything will be possible,"" Abdollahian said. Iran sponsors numerous militant groups in the region. Over the years it has trained and armed proxy militia groups in Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Gaza, where Hamas has ruled since 2007. The U. S. State Department says Iran has long provided weapons and support for Hamas. Ali Barakeh, a senior Hamas official based in Beirut has said that Iran provided ""help and support"" for its Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel where Israeli authorities say the group killed more than 1,400 people and took some 220 hostages. Iran's warning comes as Israel has intensified its airstrikes on Gaza while depriving the Palestinian enclave of food, fuel, water and electricity. Its military operations have killed more than 7,000 Palestinians, according to health officials in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, and displaced more than a million others. Israel has acknowledged civilian casualties but contends its aim is to rid the territory of Hamas fighters. In his interview with NPR, Amir-Abdollahian said Iran provides ""only political"" support for Hamas, but when asked if he would deny that Iran has armed Hamas, he said he was referring only to the current ""status quo,"" and that Hamas has sufficient weapons of its own in the current fighting. ""They have enough missiles, rockets and drones and can easily get them from anywhere,"" he said. ""They have whatever it takes to produce their own weapons and they have their own training and that is why they decided themselves to go ahead with this operation. ""Below are some additional highlights from NPR's interview with Iran's Minister of Foreign Affairs Hossein Amir-Abdollahian. The interview was conducted through an interpreter. On what would cause Iran to support a widening of the warWe don't really want this conflict to spread out. Actually, we're advising everybody and encouraging them to move toward the stopping of war crimes as soon as possible. But you know, the situation remains complicated. It's difficult for our region to tolerate the fact that 7,000 civilians have been killed as the result of the bombardments of the Israeli regime. This is the image that we're now seeing in the region and because of the continuation of crimes of the Israeli regime, the whole region has been turned into a powder keg. On whether Iran is urging its allies in the region to exercise restraintThey decide for themselves. At any moment, anything can happen. But we do encourage the U. S. to abandon its absolute total support of the Israeli regime. According to information we have inside the region, both the security and political systems of Israel have totally collapsed. The Israeli citizens have no trust whatsoever in [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and his security and political system. Right now, the only thing functional in Israel is their war machine that is also being run and controlled and managed by the U. S. Of course, if I were to be fair, I'd say Netanyahu also has his own role to play. Because if the attacks and the war stop, then he will fall in less than two days. About the foreign minister's past comments about launching ""pre-emptive action"" via members of the ""resistance front"" and the subsequent barrage of rockets fired from LebanonTwo weeks ago I visited the region and I met with some leaders of the countries of my region and with the leaders of the resistance in Lebanon and also the Palestinian groups . . . What I gathered from the plans that they have – they have their finger on the trigger. You know, much more powerful and deeper than what you've witnessed. Therefore, I believe that if this situation continues and women and children and civilians are still killed in Gaza and the West Bank, anything will be possible . . . Therefore they have their own calculations for their own security, and as I've said they decide for themselves. Regarding a recent comment by a senior Hamas official based in Beirut that, ""the implementation [of the attack] was all Hamas, but we do not deny Iran's help and support""We consider Hamas a Palestinian liberation movement. They are fighting the occupiers and I said the same thing in my speech that I just delivered to the U. N. General Assembly, that they're acting according to international laws. Iran has never approved the killing of civilians, but we do have our political support for the liberation movement so that the occupied territories will be freed. Therefore, our support is only political. Today they have enough missiles, rockets and drones and they can easily get them from anywhere . . . Now, currently, they have whatever it takes to produce their own weapons and they have their own training and that is why they decided themselves to go ahead with this operation. About the hostages Hamas is holding in GazaSome days ago, I had a meeting with [the head of the political wing of Hamas], Mr. Ismail Haniyeh in Doha, Qatar. He said that they stand ready to combat the army of Israel for a long period of time, militarily. He said that they can come to an agreement with Israel to keep the civilians away from conflict. It will be like this: We hit their military, they hit our military. It will be just between the military people, leave the civilians out of it and we've been ready to do it for a long time. We even held talks with the Qatari officials on how we can help the release of the non-military or the civilian prisoners. I raised the issue with Mr. Ismail Haniyeh. He said we have no motivation, no reason to keep those non-military prisoners. So, as soon as there's a ceasefire, we're going to identify them, to somehow separate the military from the non-military and release them. On why he believes it's necessary to wait for a ceasefire to release non-military hostagesYou know, [Israel is] killing large numbers of people and at the same time you expect them to release these people, giving them a free hand in killing them and at the same time tying your own hands? This is not logical . . . Why are you supporting the continuation of war with this question? Why not try for a ceasefire? . . . When the time comes for the release of the military prisoners then they should not forget that there are 6,000 Palestinian prisoners who are held captive by the Israelis. But the important thing now is that they're ready to release those that are not with the military.

295,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/27/1208947303/israel-gaza-palestinian-death-toll,"TEL AVIV, Israel — A bit of relief trickled in Friday to Gaza, which has been rocked by weeks of Israeli bombings and choked by a blockade. The International Committee of the Red Cross says it sent a war surgery team and other experts into the embattled Palestinian territory, along with six trucks ferrying medical supplies and water purification tools. ""Our surgical team and medical supplies will help relieve the extreme pressure on Gaza's doctors and nurses,"" said Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC's regional director. ""But safe, sustained humanitarian access is urgently needed. """"This humanitarian catastrophe is deepening by the hour,"" he added. Essential supplies such as fuel, electricity and clean water have been perilously scarce in Gaza, where more than 2. 2 million people live. The first shipment of aid was allowed to enter last weekend, at the Rafah crossing near Gaza's border with Egypt. ""Current stocks are almost completely exhausted, forcing life-saving services to come to a halt,"" according to the U. N. Palestinian refugee agency, UNRWA. ""This includes the supply of piped water as well as fuel for the health sector, bakeries, and generators. ""The medical need is dire: Violence has injured 17,439 people in Gaza, UNRWA says, and another 1,600 are reported missing, including 900 children. Many of them are presumed to be trapped under the rubble of buildings. Israel's ambassador to the U. S. , Michael Herzog, told NPR on Friday that his country's attacks aren't acts of rage, saying the military is pursuing a strategy targeting Hamas. ""We are preparing a ground operation which is designed to uproot them and their military infrastructure in Gaza,"" Herzog said. ""And we believe it's achievable. ""While the Israeli military is planning for a full-scale invasion, the timeline for when it might start is unclear. Palestinian officials have released a list of more than 6,700 names of what they describe as Palestinians killed in Gaza since the outbreak of war with Israel earlier this month. The list of names and corresponding identification numbers from Gaza's Ministry of Health came late Thursday in response to comments from President Biden casting doubt on the Palestinian death toll. In total, officials in Gaza say that 7,028 have been killed so far, but several hundred have not yet been identified. Israel has pummeled Gaza ever since Hamas, the militant group that governs the territory, unleashed a day of violence on Israeli communities near its border on Oct. 7, attacking soldiers and civilians in a rampage that Israel says left 1,400 people dead. Nearly 230 hostages continue to be held by Hamas. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby later said the White House did not dispute reports that thousands of Palestinians had been killed. ""We absolutely know that the death toll continues to rise in Gaza,"" Kirby said in a briefing. ""But what we're saying is, you shouldn't rely on numbers put forth by Hamas. ""The list of the dead could not be independently verified. With Gaza's borders closed, it is impossible for foreign journalists to verify information. The health ministry is run in coordination with the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority, and its numbers are produced in connection with hospitals in Gaza. The ministry's numbers are seen as credible by humanitarian organizations and are widely cited, including by the U. S. State Department. Over the past week, Israel has sent troops into Gaza for raids on what they describe as Hamas military infrastructure. The ground troops were accompanied by airstrikes and artillery shelling, officials said, and several of the raids have included tanks. On Thursday, Israel announced it had killed Shadi Barud, a top Hamas intelligence official who Israel described as one of the two architects behind the Oct. 7 assault, alongside Yahya Sinwar, the Palestinian leader of Hamas in Gaza. Overall, Israel has increased the intensity of its attacks on Gaza, some days conducting hundreds of airstrikes on the 25-mile-long territory. The increased pace of strikes has terrified Palestinians living in Gaza. ""Last night was just horrible. Every second and every minute there was continuous bombing,"" said Shaimaa Ahed on Thursday. The 20-year-old engineering student has been documenting her experience during the conflict for the Institute for Middle East Understanding, a U. S. -based non-profit that seeks to give voice to Palestinians. The home where Ahed is staying is so full of dirt and gunpowder, she said, that everyone inside takes turns wearing a mask with a wet cloth held over it, hoping to avoid breathing in unhealthy air. As she spoke, multiple explosions could be heard striking nearby. ""To be honest, I'm not OK. I'm alive, yes, but I'm physically and mentally drained, and so are all the people of the Gaza strip,"" she said. ""If it wasn't for our faith and religion, we would have completely broken down. ""Israeli officials say they have warned Israelis who have evacuated from areas near the fighting that they could be away from their homes for months. ""This is a long haul. This is not just another round with Gaza. This is something much bigger,"" Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, a military spokesperson, told NPR Thursday. A quarter million Israelis have been displaced from their homes in Israel's north and south, officials say, about half of them voluntarily and half of them under government supervision. Under evacuation orders are towns near the border of the Gaza Strip, an area known as the Gaza Envelope, and towns along Israel's northern border with Lebanon, where violence with Hezbollah has increased over the last few weeks. In Tel Aviv — a major city where many evacuees have come — a rare rocket strike rattled residents Friday afternoon. Emergency medic officials reported three injuries and no deaths. Hamas claimed credit for the attack shortly after. Since Oct. 7, Hamas has fired more than 7,000 rockets at Israel, Israeli officials say. Most have been intercepted by the anti-rocket defense system known as the Iron Dome, but some have landed. At least 11 Israelis have been killed in rocket strikes, Israel says. The Friday rocket, one out of several barrages on Tel Aviv throughout the day, hit an apartment building on the city's southeast side and caused significant damage to the building's upper floors. Within minutes of the strike, the street had filled with first responders, soldiers, journalists and onlookers curious for a glimpse of the damage. ""This is the reality we're facing now. It's much more constant,"" said Eden Ringel, an American Israeli woman who said she came to the scene because her boyfriend, a first responder, had been called in. ""If we didn't have the Iron Dome and the U. S. 's help, Israel would look exactly the same [as Gaza], if not worse,"" she said. Becky Sullivan reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

296,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/27/1208694837/two-state-solution-israeli-palestinian-conflict,"Israel continues to respond to Hamas' unprecedented attack on its people, bombarding Gaza and preparing for a ground offensive. Humanitarian groups and some foreign leaders are calling for a cease-fire. But what are the prospects for long-term peace?President Biden said Wednesday that there is no going back to the status quo before Oct. 7 — meaning in part that when the crisis is over, there must be a view of what comes next. ""In our view, it has to be a two-state solution,"" he said, reiterating a comment he made during his visit to Israel. ""And that means a concentrated effort for all the parties — Israelis, Palestinians, regional partners, global leaders — to put us on a path toward peace. ""The two-state solution calls for establishing an independent state for Palestinians alongside that of Israel. And U. S. support for it is nothing new: For decades, it has been the primary proposed framework for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But failed peace talks, logistical questions, expanded Israeli settlements, Palestinian attacks and recurring clashes have kept it from becoming a reality. The two-state solution has seen dwindling support from both Palestinians and Israelis over the years. And its prospects now seem dimmer than ever, in light of Hamas' attack on Israel and Israel's response. Dennis Ross, who was the chief U. S. negotiator at the 2000 Camp David summit between Israeli and Palestinian leaders, told NPR that as heartbreaking as the situation is in the Middle East right now, eventually ""there needs to be a day after. """"We have to understand: Israelis aren't going anyplace, and Palestinians aren't going anyplace,"" Ross said. ""Somehow, given that, we have to find a way towards coexistence, and obviously, we're not there now. ""The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is long running and complex but primarily rooted in a dispute over land with immense historical and religious significance to Jews and Muslims (as well as Christians). Jewish proponents of the Zionist movement began moving to Ottoman Palestine — which was predominantly Arab — in the late 19th century, seeking safety from European antisemitism in their ancient homeland. Many more followed suit after the Holocaust. Tensions grew between the two groups. And Britain — which had governed Palestine since 1922 — referred the issue to the United Nations. The U. N. General Assembly voted in 1947 to divide Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. The partition plan was rejected by the Arab community, in part due to concerns about how much land and access to resources it would get. But the plan was embraced by the Jewish community as legal justification for the establishment of Israel. Israel declared independence in May 1948. Five Arab nations immediately invaded the new country, prompting a major Israeli offensive and many months of fighting. That resulted in the permanent displacement of thousands of Palestinians, which some refer to as the Nakba, meaning ""catastrophe"" in Arabic. Another major turning point came in 1967, with Israel's decisive victory in the Six-Day War against Egypt, Syria and Jordan. Israel gained territory four times its original size, taking control of the Sinai Peninsula, the Golan Heights, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. Those territories have been a major point of contention and peace negotiations ever since. The U. N. issued a resolution in 1967 calling for Israeli troops to withdraw from areas it captured, though the resolution's meaning has been disputed. That set up the current occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, which are collectively home to some 5 million Palestinians. (Israel pulled troops and settlers out of Gaza in 2005, but it's still considered an occupied territory because the withdrawal was done without any agreement and Israel still exerts control over it. )The two-state solution was baked into Israel's creation but didn't necessarily play out as planned, says Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""What started off in the U. N. 's mind as a 50-50 split of Mandatory Palestine, after the 1948 war — which was initiated by the Arab armies — it was more than 50 percent for Israel. After 1967, it was 100 percent-plus for Israel,"" he says. ""And now Israel is, I think, the only country that's hard to draw on a map. ""U. S. President Bill Clinton brought Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin together in 1993 to negotiate the agreement that came to be known as the Oslo Accords. In it, Israel officially recognized the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people and a partner in future negotiations, and the PLO renounced terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist. The deal raised expectations for a two-state solution. But it quickly began to unravel after a series of events, including a 1994 attack on a mosque in Hebron by an American Jewish settler and Rabin's assassination in 1995 by an Israeli settler opposed to the agreement. Almost immediately after the Oslo Accords were signed, Israel enhanced its policy of fragmenting Gaza from the West Bank and East Jerusalem, says Atalia Omer, a professor of religion, conflict and peace studies at the Keough School of Global Affairs at the University of Notre Dame. At the same time, Israeli settlements continued to proliferate in the West Bank — on occupied land that the Palestinians hoped would be part of their state. And that has continued in the years since. The population of Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, grew from 520,000 to more than 700,000 between 2012 and 2022, according to the U. N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. ""Settlements continue to eat into Palestinian spaces,"" Omer says. ""And over the course of the 30 years since the Oslo Accords — signed in the White House in September 1993 — the settlements completely prevented the possibility of a contiguous sovereign Palestinian state within that two-state framework. ""Discussions of a two-state solution center on a number of core issues, as the Council on Foreign Relations explains. One is how exactly the borders would be drawn. Most international diplomacy favors Israel reverting to a version of its pre-1967 borders, without a consensus on how that would account for the Palestinians living within those borders or the Jewish Israelis beyond them. Israel has annexed the whole city of Jerusalem as its capital, while Palestinians claim East Jerusalem for the capital of their state — which makes for another logistical question. There's also the major question of Palestinian refugees of the wars of 1948 and 1967. The survivors and their descendants live mostly in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria and claim the right to return to Israel based on a 1948 U. N. General Assembly resolution. Israel views that right to return as a threat to its existence as a Jewish state and believes those refugees should go to the Palestinian state instead. Security looms large, too. Israel views certain Palestinian militant groups as existential threats — including Hamas, which governs Gaza and whose founding charter called for the obliteration of Israel — and wants them to disarm. Israel wants to maintain the ability to act in Palestinian areas against security threats. Palestinians want an end to Israel's military occupation and full control over their own security. Both sides want recognition of their respective states by the other and the international community. Palestinians also want acknowledgment of and redress for their forced displacement, Omer says. ""There needs to be a recognition and kind of naming, and then put in place mechanisms to redress — how can Palestinians be compensated for historical injustice they experienced — and then figure out ways of respecting Jewish citizens in the space through principles of equality and democracy,"" Omer says. There has been little progress since the turn of the millennium. The collapse of the 2000 peace process fueled the Second Intifada, a major Palestinian uprising in the Israel-occupied Palestinian territories and Israel. It ended in 2005 with some 1,000 Israelis and 3,200 Palestinians dead, along with heightened skepticism of the peace process on both sides. Those feelings seem to have prevailed in the years since, which have been marked by terrorist attacks, military raids, rocket fire, border clashes and other incidents. ""As a fundamental proposition, it's hard to have productive peace talks when no side sees either urgency or necessity to reach an agreement,"" says Alterman, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He says that from an Israeli perspective, security was improving, Palestinian demands were diminishing and it would be politically divisive to make concessions to them. Palestinians, meanwhile, had a sense that they couldn't make an agreement with the right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and that it wasn't worth giving up rights when demographics are in their favor in the long run. All the while, support for a two-state solution has shrunk considerably among both Israelis and Palestinians. A Gallup poll released last week — conducted before Hamas' attack on Israel — found that just 24% of Palestinians living in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem supported a two-state solution. That figure is down from 59% in 2012. A Pew Research Center poll released in September found that only 35% of Israelis think ""a way can be found for Israel and an independent Palestinian state to coexist peacefully,"" a decline of 15 percentage points since 2013. ""A decent number of Israelis and Palestinians have come to conclude that it's not a solution, that the nature of Israeli behavior, especially in the West Bank, makes a Palestinian state unviable,"" says Alterman, noting that many members of the Israeli government want to annex the West Bank altogether. He says it's too early to say where the current conflict will go, though many Israelis believe Israeli politics are more likely to move to the right than the left in the wake of Hamas' attack, which killed some 1,400 people in Israel and resulted in more than 220 hostages taken. ""When I talk to Israeli officials, I don't get any sense that part of the strategy is providing a political horizon for Palestinians,"" he added, ""which is what a peace agreement would ostensibly be. ""That doesn't mean Israeli citizens aren't pushing for peace at all. Sally Abed is a member of Standing Together, an organization that aims to improve Arab-Jewish relations within Israel, and she's also a Palestinian. ""I really don't want to think that we needed to endure such loss, such atrocities here in Israel,"" she told NPR. ""But maybe now I really hope that from this dark corner, we can have this shift in the paradigm on how we actually look at these wars and how, actually, we look at the Israeli control over Gaza and over the West Bank, and really have a different outlook on what our leadership actually should look like. ""There are alternatives to a two-state solution — including a one-state solution, a confederation, annexation and maintaining the status quo — at least in theory. Rand Corp. focus groups conducted in 2018 and 2019 found that none of those was acceptable to a majority of both Israelis and Palestinians, underscoring the deep complexities and emotions involved. Alterman says one of the biggest challenges for Israelis is balancing the need for a Jewish state and a democratic state. ""If you have a one-state solution that gives citizenship to all of the natural-born residents of Mandatory Palestine — which includes Gaza and the West Bank — you don't have a Jewish majority,"" he explained. ""A substantial line of thought [in Israel] is that it's more important that Israel be Jewish than democratic. ""In contrast, most Americans — 73% — would choose a democratic over a Jewish Israel, according to a University of Maryland and Ipsos poll conducted this year. Omer is one of many who see the current reality as that of a single state. She points to the exclusionary practices and annexationist policies of the right-wing Netanyahu government, like a 2018 law that demoted Arabic as one of Israel's official languages, and the recent findings of human rights groups in and beyond Israel that its practices toward Palestinians amount to apartheid. She says some Israeli and Palestinian activists support a one-state solution, but in different formats and for different reasons. Some leftists and Palestinians support the creation of a democratic, secular country in which Arab Muslims would outnumber Jews. But some rightists and Israelis would prefer to see Israel annex the West Bank — either forcing out Palestinians or denying them the right to vote — which is illegal under international human rights law. Some activists, like the group A Land for All, argue that solutions based on separation have failed in the past, and they are instead pushing for a confederal framework, with two sovereign states sharing the capital of Jerusalem and an open border. Omer says there are ""historical examples of life together in this space that is not within the paradigm of domination. "" She acknowledges that it's hard to imagine those kinds of possibilities in this moment but says the need for change is clear. ""What we can see depends on, also, an expression of how the paradigm that had been there before Oct. 7 is completely collapsing,"" she says. ""And all these contradictions just cannot be sustained anymore. """,npr_articles/article_296.txt,npr_results/article_296.txt.json
297,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/26/1208456496/iran-hamas-axis-of-resistance-hezbollah-israel,"LONDON — Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued a warning this week that the United States would act ""swiftly and decisively"" if it came under attack from Iran or its proxies in the Middle East, amid growing concerns of the Israel-Hamas war spreading. His warning came as the White House accused Iran of facilitating attacks on U. S. military bases in Syria and Iraq in the last week. Questions about the extent of Iran's involvement in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel have shone a spotlight on Iranian influence in the Middle East and raised major concerns about the prospect of a wider war engulfing the region. The U. S. has said there is no direct evidence that Iran was involved in the Hamas attack against Israel. However, analysts and regional experts say there are evident links between Iran and the attacks carried out by Hamas. ""Hamas and Iran have a long-standing but not always easy relationship,"" says Kim Ghattas, author of Black Wave, a book about the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. ""Hamas gets funding and weapons from Iran. So whether or not it approved of the Oct. 7 attack, Iran is complicit. ""Ali Barakeh, a senior Hamas official based in Lebanon, told NPR earlier this month that while ""Iran knows that Hamas fights Israel and offers us support, which we do not deny . . . we don't take orders from anyone. ""Hamas, a Sunni Islamist movement, is an autonomous Palestinian group with military and political wings. Hamas has ruled more than 2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip since 2007. Gaza has not had elections since Hamas seized power that same year from the Palestinian Authority, which rules the West Bank. Hamas receives funding and weapons from Iran. The two have had rifts in the past, and do not always agree. Most recently, they fell out over Syria's civil war. Tehran withdrew funding from Hamas when the group chose to stand with protesters against Syria's leader Bashar Assad, whom Tehran supports. Hamas also has other backers, including Turkey. Hamas comes under the so-called ""axis of resistance,"" a multi-pronged network of different forces across the region, supported to varying degrees by Iran. The term ""axis of resistance"" is believed to have emerged in response to President George W. Bush's use of the term ""axis of evil"" — referring to Iran, Iraq and North Korea — in his 2002 State of the Union address. There are conflicting reports about who first coined the term, which is often used by Iranian officials. The ""axis of resistance"" is an informal, loose-knit alliance that includes both Sunni and Shia Muslim groups and governments in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and Iraq, with differences and varying levels of proximity to one another and to Tehran. The Iranian regime and its Quds Force, a subset of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard corps, have grown this network more on the basis of shared resistance to Western powers and Israel. The axis includes the Lebanese militant group and Shia political party Hezbollah, the Syrian regime and Shia militias in Syria, which Tehran has built up and trained. Yemen's Houthi rebels also come under the axis. The Houthis have fought a civil war against Yemen's government — which is backed by Saudi Arabia — for nearly a decade. The Pentagon said last week it had shot down missiles from Yemen that were potentially headed for Israel. The axis also comprises militias in the influential Iran-backed Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq, which were formed to help fight ISIS in 2014. In Lebanon, Iran-backed Hezbollah operates both as a Shia Muslim political party and militant group. Hezbollah wields significant power, especially in southern Lebanon, and is active along Israel's northern border, where tensions have been building since the Oct. 7 attacks. Each axis group has a different relationship with Iran. They also have differences with one another. In Gaza, both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad — a smaller, rival militant group that does not engage in the political process — are considered part of the alliance. Unlike Hamas, however, the PIJ receives most of its budget from the Islamic Republic. ""It is important to remember that Hamas is not a proxy of Iran in the way that Hezbollah is,"" says Ghattas, who is also a distinguished fellow at the Columbia Institute of Global Politics and spent two decades covering the region as a journalist for the BBC and the Financial Times. ""Hezbollah has become an extension of [the] Iranian Revolutionary Guards Quds Force,"" Ghattas says. ""Hamas keeps its own separate identity and it has other backers, aside from Iran. ""But despite their differences, Ghattas says, their interests often converge, as is the case this month. ""Their agendas still align in an anti-American, anti-Israel worldview, and they come together again when necessary,"" Ghattas says. According to reports in the international media, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah met senior officials from Hamas in Beirut Wednesday to discuss the situation in the Middle East. A statement following the meeting said their goal was to achieve ""a real victory for the resistance in Gaza and Palestine"" and halt Israel's ""treacherous and brutal aggression against our oppressed and steadfast people in Gaza and the West Bank. ""Earlier this year, Nasrallah began referring to a ""unity of fronts. "" The idea was that these disparate groups — all benefiting from Iran's support — would coordinate in their opposition to Israel. Experts say there has been more cross-border coordination between these groups in recent years, even before Nasrallah specifically called for this. ""Over the past couple of years, Iran has been working to coordinate its proxies in what it describes as a 'unification of fronts,' surrounding Israel on all fronts,"" says Ghattas. ""It is a more logistically coordinated operation, rather than each group doing its own thing. ""This includes Hezbollah in Lebanon and other, less direct proxies, like Hamas in Gaza, Ghattas says. Paul Salem, president of the Middle East Institute in Washington, told NPR's Ailsa Chang, ""It's quite likely that Hezbollah knew of the preplanning [for the Oct. 7 attacks] and probably participated in training and planning with Hamas, and all of them sort of are part of this Iranian proxy force deployment that you have in Lebanon, in Syria, in Yemen, in Iraq and in Gaza as well. ""Mohanad Hage Ali, a Beirut-based senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, told NPR's Scott Simon that the ""unity of fronts"" of Iranian-backed proxy groups is ""a kind of NATO for militant groups"" in the region, requiring allied organizations to step in and provide military support should any other member groups face an existential threat. ""I would suppose that Hezbollah would find it difficult not to intervene, although it remains a challenge given the cost of the conflict and what it means for Lebanon,"" Hage Ali told NPR. And preventing a broader war consuming the region similarly requires coordination and tight control over the battlefield, Ghattas says. ""More cross-border coordination allows the Iranians to tightly control escalation and deescalation,"" she says.",npr_articles/article_297.txt,npr_results/article_297.txt.json
298,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/26/1208179128/is-it-true-or-not-israeli-group-fakereporter-fact-checks-while-seeking-shelter,"Achiya Schatz walked into the kitchen and saw his mother-in-law standing there in tears. Schatz, his pregnant partner, their toddler daughter,  and two other Israeli families had fled the violence of the war, putting eleven under one roof at the home of his in-laws outside of Tel Aviv. The house became a cacophony of screaming children, frantic phone calls and emergency Zoom meetings. Sometimes all three families are forced to seek shelter together from rocket attacks. Yet what most rattled his mother-in-law were the unsettling images of children in cages. ""I asked her, 'what happened?' And she said I just saw a horrible video of babies in cages,"" Schatz said. Not only did he immediately know that she was referring to deceptive footage, but the organization he runs, FakeReporter, was the first to show that the video portrayed something else entirely. The clip had been posted online months before Hamas attacked Israel, though the footage's exact origins remain the subject of online debate. ""This is a video that we refuted, "" he told his mother-in-law. ""It's a lie. It's fake. ""Those words — ""It's a lie. It's a fake""— are uttered quite a bit these days by Schatz and his associates ever since the Hamas-Israel war broke out, unleashing an informational war online. FakeReporter was founded about three years ago. Prior to the war, it was focused on assisting people targeted with online harassment for speaking out against government corruption. Before FakeReporter, Schatz, 38, was the spokesman for an organization called Breaking the Silence, which published anonymous testimonies of Israeli soldiers who claimed they witnessed ethical misconduct during their service in West Bank and Gaza. It was called ""perhaps Israel's most hated NGO,"" by the magazine Jerusalem Report since the group highlights ""the dark underbelly of the Palestinian occupation. "" It also drew public criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The group's material was banned from schools and army bases for ""delegitimizing the State of Israel. "" Lawmakers, in 2017, even introduced a bill in the Knesset to outlaw the group completely. Schatz, himself once stationed in the West Bank when he was a combat solider for the Israel Defense Forces, saw just how toxic the online attacks against Breaking the Silence became. It made him realize that there needs to be an organization that both shields outspoken activists in Israel from online harassment and calls out false claims. ""What should be an open conversation in our society became very hostile and violent, and the No. 1 place where the violence and hostility was being carried out was online,"" Schatz said. ""When you don't see one another and there's no filters, it becomes a tool of attack. "" Which led to the creation of FakeReporter, said Schatz, who as CEO of the non-profit leads a team of about 15 full-time people, in addition to thousands of volunteers. For the past three weeks, plenty of real photos and videos have spread portraying grisly and barbaric violence in the Israel-Hamas war, but fake images have also inundated online platforms. FakeReporter is part of a loose yet growing coalition of individuals and groups around the world attempting to push back against the torrent of bogus material about the war circulating online. Since the war started, the group has assembled more than 3,000 volunteers, mostly in Israel, who have access to software where images and videos suspected of being fake or misleading are flagged. From there, the posts are sent to trained experts, who, through some internet sleuthing and forensic analysis, figure out whether something is real or fake. They then share the conclusion of their findings across their social media accounts and report the posts to tech companies, and their reports are helping to get harmful content removed. ""We're seeing violence and lies taken down and disinformation being refuted because of our reports,"" he said. Schatz is overseeing it all from his in-laws' house. ""The house became like a war room for our team,"" he said. ""Half of my team came, and we sat together, and it became not just a house shelter, but also like a situation room to deal with the situation. ""Examples of fabrications from the war are legion: Photos from past conflicts being passed off as live footage from Gaza; fake orders from Netanyahu; inflammatory messages purporting to be from the IDF. Social media companies have teams dedicated to catching misleading material, yet action can take time. A video could reach millions before it is removed. Meanwhile, fake content online is contributing another dimension of chaos to a conflict that is politically fraught and where facts are difficult to parse from hour to hour. ""There's a sense that you can't believe anyone. It's something that actually crumbles society,"" he said. At the start of the war, Schatz said the day-to-day work was especially challenging because social media companies had almost no open lines of communication, especially X, (formerly Twitter) since owner Elon Musk had gutted the company's trust and safety team. Recently, X, and all the other platforms, have become more responsive to what FakeReporter is finding, according to Schatz. ""Platforms seems to be finally understanding the situation,"" he said. ""But why did we have to wait for a war to understand that people need to be protected in the online world?"" That conversation with his mother-in-law in the kitchen about the misleading kids-in-cages video helped Schatz understand the importance of fighting the spread of disinformation online. It became personal. It became visceral. It became something more than broadcasting on social media that a widely-seen photo is in fact phony. Persuading even his own family, he learned, is not as easy as pointing out a fact. ""It barely touched her,"" he said of her reaction when he informed her the footage was not real. ""She was still just very shocked from it. "" Truth-squadding the lies of war is not just about separating fact from fiction, he said. It's also about changing how people respond emotionally to a conflict. ""And you can see, for example, my mother-in-law, it really broke her down, the same is happening for millions of people around the world, seeing such horrific videos online, but they aren't necessarily true. ""And when the next fake horrific video starts spreading online, he hopes the FakeReporter team can stop it in its tracks before it goes viral. ""It's nonstop. There are no mornings or nights anymore,"" he said. ""We are really working in one endless day. "" ",npr_articles/article_298.txt,npr_results/article_298.txt.json
299,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/26/1208680784/death-toll-in-gaza-approaches-7-000-as-aid-groups-raise-alarm-about-fuel,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel said it carried out a ""targeted raid"" in northern Gaza Wednesday overnight into Thursday, the most extensive use of Israeli tanks in Gaza since it launched its war with the Palestinian militant group Hamas after the Oct. 7 attacks. An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson said the raid involved a number of tanks and troops and ""eliminated terrorists and destroyed terrorist infrastructure. "" The tanks have since exited Gaza, and there were no Israeli casualties, the IDF said. The Israeli military said its forces killed Shadi Barud, the deputy head of Hamas intelligence, one of the targets of the raid. IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Richard Hecht said Barud had teamed up with other militants to plan ""numerous terror attacks against Israeli civilians. ""The IDF said airstrikes killed three other senior Hamas operatives ""who played a significant role in the invasion and murderous attack against Israel"" on Oct. 7. The IDF said the incursion was made ""in preparation for the next stages of war. "" While Hecht said planning for a full-scale invasion of Gaza continues, he would not offer a timeline on when that might begin. He did say that the 200-some hostages Hamas is believed to be holding makes any operation into Gaza far more complicated. Israel has increased the intensity of its attacks on the Hamas-run territory over the last few days, with hundreds of airstrikes each night, as Gaza's lack of fuel reaches a crisis point. Sixty-two aid trucks have entered Gaza since last weekend, carrying much-needed food, water and medical supplies. But none has delivered fuel, which Israel has blocked over concerns it could be stolen and used by Hamas. As a result, aid groups have escalated their warnings. UNRWA, the United Nations agency that provides relief to Palestinians, says it could run out of fuel within a day. ""The situation is terrible and it gets worse by the hour — not even by the day — every hour, things get worse and worse for people in Gaza,"" Juliette Touma, an UNRWA spokesperson, told NPR. The streets of Gaza are empty of cars. Many of its bakeries are shuttered; meat suppliers have no refrigeration. Doctors perform operations by flashlight. Fuel is needed for U. N. vehicles to collect aid from the border and distribute it across Gaza, Touma said. Fuel is also used to power hospitals, where doctors have warned that people will die if life-saving medical equipment is forced to go out of operation. The lack of fuel has also disabled water pumps and restricted an already limited food supply in Gaza, the U. N. warns. The World Health Organization has said it has trucks on standby across the border in Egypt with medical supplies: ""WHO calls for immediate and uninterrupted access into and across Gaza, so that its ailing health system can be urgently revived. ""Gaza's bakeries have shut down, including many of those that contract with the World Food Programme. (At least 10 bakeries have been struck and destroyed over the last week, according to the U. N. )For those that remain intact and operational, long lines form daily, exposing people to airstrikes. The lack of electricity or fuel for generators has also started to affect meat suppliers, who cannot refrigerate their products, according to the U. N. In response to an UNRWA appeal for fuel on the social media site X, the Israel Defense Forces responded with a satellite image of what it described as fuel tanks located in Gaza. ""Ask Hamas if you can have some,"" the agency wrote. The Hamas supply contains ""enough for many days for hospitals and water pumps to run,"" Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an IDF spokesperson, said Thursday. The UNRWA said Thursday that 53 members of its staff have been killed in Gaza since Israel's offensive began. ""They were all teachers, they were all nurses, doctors, most of them have been killed while they were in their home or in shelter, they were with their families,"" Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of the UNRWA, told NPR.  The reported death toll in Gaza has now surpassed 7,000, the territory's health officials say. In Israel, more than 1,400 people died after the Oct. 7 surprise Hamas attack, according to Israeli officials. Asked Wednesday about the reported death toll in Gaza, President Biden responded that he had ""no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed. """"The Israelis should be incredibly careful to be sure that they're focusing on going after the folks that are propagating this war against Israel,"" he said, adding that ""it's against their interest when that doesn't happen. ""The Palestinian agency that produces the death tolls, the Ministry of Health, is nominally operated by the Palestinian Authority, which provides funding and supplies and maintains close contact with hospitals in Gaza. Hamas governs Gaza and likely has close oversight over information Gaza health officials put out. The daily casualty counts are broadly considered to be accurate by humanitarian groups and have been cited by the State Department. Gaza's borders are effectively closed, limiting the ability of aid groups and journalists to access the territory in order to independently verify the numbers. Humanitarian groups warn that the death toll could dramatically increase if Israel follows through with its threats of a ground invasion. As the conflict nears the end of its third week, more than 200 hostages still remain in Hamas captivity after the Oct. 7 attack. U. S. officials and hostages' families have urged Israeli forces to delay the invasion in order to leave more time for negotiations over their release. And hundreds of U. S. citizens are still stranded in Gaza. Massachusetts resident Abood Okal, along with his wife and their 1-year-old son, have been sharing a house in southern Rafah with dozens of others, he told NPR. They sleep on the floor, without running water and only a couple hours a day of electricity from the home's solar panels. On Wednesday, they ran out of milk for his son, he said. ""We feel fortunate every morning that we wake up and we have lived for another day,"" Okal said. ""But it's becoming increasingly harder and harder to find hope with everything else going around us. ""More than 1 million Palestinians have fled their homes due to Israeli bombing and the expected ground invasion. Israeli officials say a quarter-million Israelis have now evacuated their homes due to the ongoing threat of rocket attacks. Those Israelis have been told it's unlikely they'll return home until sometime next year. Israeli authorities say they've supervised the formal evacuation of 125,000 citizens in communities closest to the southern border with Gaza and the northern border with Lebanon. Hamas is still firing rockets from Gaza, and the Lebanese militant and political group Hezbollah is shooting sporadically from southern Lebanon. In addition, another 125,000 Israelis have evacuated on their own from areas slightly further from the borders. The quarter-million displaced Israelis are staying in ""hotels, hostels, anyplace that can provide a meal and a bed,"" an IDF official said. Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, speaking before the U. N. General Assembly on Thursday, warned the U. S. that it would be held responsible if Israel's attacks against Hamas in Gaza doesn't cease. ""I say frankly to the American statesmen, who are now managing the genocide in Palestine, that we do not welcome expansion of the war in the region,"" he said. ""But if the genocide in Gaza continues, they will not be spared from this fire. ""Amir-Abdollahian told NPR on Thursday that militants in Lebanon and elsewhere in the region have their ""finger on the trigger"" to launch more strikes against Israel if it goes forward with a ground invasion of Gaza. ""What I gathered from what I heard from them and the plans that they have – they have their finger on the trigger. You know, much more powerful and deeper than what you've witnessed,"" he said. ""Therefore I believe that if this situation continues and women and children and civilians are still killed in Gaza and the West Bank anything will be possible. ""Iran has a long history of funding, arming and training proxy militia groups in the region, including Hamas, but denies playing any role in the Oct. 7 attack.

""There is no doubt about that. ""Galea is talking about the war in the Middle East, where Hamas attacks have killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and Israel's bombing campaign against Hamas has killed well over 6,500 people in Gaza. Studies the world over have documented that traumatic events like war and armed conflicts can cause an alarming spike in post-traumatic stress and depression. In the United States, Galea and his colleagues documented the mental health toll of 9/11 starting about a month after the attacks. They found that of adults living in New York City and neighboring areas in New Jersey and southern Connecticut, 7. 5% reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and nearly 10% reported symptoms of depression. The rates of these symptoms were nearly double the national baseline prevalence of 3. 6% for PTSD and 4. 9% for depression. While Galea and his colleagues found that this burden of mental health symptoms declined about 6 months after the attack, a significant minority continued to struggle long-term. ""So about a third of people [went] on to have chronic symptoms,"" says Galea. ""By chronic, I mean, years thereafter. ""About 10% of the 70,000 enrollees in the World Trade Center Health Registry who were directly affected by the attack have continued to report symptoms of PTSD over the years. In Israel and Gaza, people are now coping with the death and kidnapping of loved ones, of watching others die, of trying to stay safe and simply get food and medicine needed to get by. Past studies of mass traumas suggest that they're all at risk of trauma-related mental health problems. Those who were directly affected by a mass trauma are of course at the greatest risk of developing symptoms of mental illnesses, says Galea: ""So somebody who lost a loved one, somebody who lost a limb, was injured in the event, somebody who lost their house in an event. ""Those who are mostly likely to struggle with chronic symptoms are people with prior traumas and hardships and people who continue to have chronic stressors in their lives, like job and housing insecurity, and a lack of social support. That's what Galea and others have found in their research. Mental health issues are emerging even in these early days of the war. Following the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre, Israel's mental health crisis line saw a surge in calls, says sociologist Nira Kaplansky, who oversees the hotline, which is run by an organization called Natal. ""From a line of 25 to 100 calls a day, we became a line of 1,200 calls a day,"" she says. Almost overnight, she and her colleagues had to train more volunteers online to become crisis counselors. ""We were around 50 volunteers and now we are 150,"" says Kaplansky. Even as Hamas carried out the attacks, people called the NATAL helpline out of sheer desperation because they couldn't get through to the army or other helplines, she says. ""We had calls from people that were inside their panic rooms, and they were telling us that someone is trying to open the panic room and they are inside with their wife and kids,"" says Kaplansky. ""The only thing that you can do is stay there with"" the caller, says Kaplansky, and reassure them they are doing the best thing to protect their family. She also recounts a call from a young person ""who was in a panic room and both his parents were dead in the room near him. [He was] asking, crying, screaming for help. ""Those aren't the kind of calls Natal's crisis counselors were used to answering. The work has been emotionally difficult for the staff and volunteers, too, she adds, because they have been reeling from their own trauma and grief. ""Each one of us has been to at least one funeral in the last week, sometimes two,""""I have friends who have lost children and I have friends who have a kidnapped child,"" says Emi Palmor, the chair of NATAL. ""And really, you say to yourself 'I don't want anything in my life anymore. Nothing. I just want to be out of this nightmare. '""The call volume has decreased since the initial surge but remains above normal, says Kaplansky. People are calling to describe classic trauma-related symptoms: intrusive thoughts about the attacks, nightmares, not being able to sleep. The callers say they are trying to avoid situations that remind them of what they went through. For example, ""'I don't want to be where there's people around me and I don't know who they are,'"" says Kaplansky, ""'I don't want to be in an enclosed place. I can't hear explosions anymore. ""Counselors tell the callers that these are all normal reactions to traumatic circumstances — and they may keep people from functioning in their daily lives. For people who need further mental health care, the counselors refer them to Natal's clinics. Both Kaplansky and Palmor expect the need for mental health care to remain high for the foreseeable future. ""So if we are terrified [now], you can imagine what the morning after [might be],"" says Palmor. ""And we don't know when this morning after will arrive. We are still heading a conflict in Gaza, which can be awful and it's going to cost lives. ""In Gaza, about 1. 4 million people have left their homes and are trying to stay safe from Israel's airstrikes as they wait for aid. Iman Farajallah is a Palestinian-American psychologist based in the Bay Area in California. She grew up in Gaza and is now anxiously eyeing her phone for any news from family members in the territory. ""All my siblings, all of their homes [have been] bombed, all of them,"" she says. ""My sisters right now, they are staying in schools on the northwest coast. But they have no electricity, no access to electricity, water or food. ""One of her brothers has been carrying their 85-year-old father on his back from shelter to shelter, she says. Lately, sometimes days pass before she receives any word from them because of limited electricity and internet access in Gaza. ""When I send them a message and it takes 2 to 3 days for them to get a little bit of internet to send me that 'we are okay,' 'we are still alive,' or, 'no, we are not okay, it's very touch,"" she says. Farajallah has lost former neighbors and family members in Gaza in the past week, including children in her family. ""My cousin lost his wife and three kids,"" she says. The children were at home with their mother, who had been ""praying when they bombed her. ""This war only adds to decades of violence and war experienced by people in Gaza, says Farajallah, who in recent years has documented the mental health impact of past conflicts on children there. Children and adolescents in Gaza were already struggling with a range of mental health and behavioral symptoms. ""Cognitive symptoms such as confusion, lack of concentration, inattention, ADHD, incoherent speech, deterioration in their ability to achieve anything in a school,"" she says. Many children have trouble complying with rules at home or at school, she adds. They also show symptoms of ""social withdrawal or maybe anger and violence, wetting their bed, fear of darkness, generic tension, a flashback or nightmares. ""Numerous past studies by other researchers have documented already high rates of mental health disorders like PTSD and depression in the population --especially among children and adolescents, who make up nearly half of the population in Gaza. Estimates vary across studies, but a 2011 study by Lydia Dimitry of Imperial College London found that 23-70% of children and teens in Palestine had had PTSD. Another study in 2011 by George Bonnano at Columbia University and his colleagues also found high rates of PTSD and depression in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and many people with these symptoms struggled to recover because of chronic exposure to violence as well as the chronic stress of personal losses and poverty. Farajallah notes that the diagnosis of PTSD doesn't capture what people in Gaza struggle with. ""We cannot call this PTSD. It's a continuous trauma that is happening over and over and over again 24/7. Ninety-nine percent if not 100% of the population of Gaza, they all suffer from continuous trauma. ""She worries that the current conflict just exacerbates prior traumas, creating ""a traumatized nation. """,npr_articles/article_300.txt,npr_results/article_300.txt.json
301,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/25/1208019720/journalist-deaths-gaza-israel-hamas,"At least 24 journalists are among the more than 6,000 people who have been killed in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, according to the latest tally released Wednesday by the Committee to Protect Journalists. In addition to the steep toll the fighting has meant for civilians in the region, the conflict in Gaza has resulted in the deadliest stretch for journalists in Israel and the occupied territories since the committee began tracking journalist deaths in 1992, the organization's emergencies director, Lucy Westcott, told NPR. Of the two dozen journalists who have died, 20 were Palestinian, three were Israeli and one was Lebanese. At least eight other journalists have been reported injured, while three others are believed missing or detained, according to the CPJ. The last time journalists faced such heightened danger in Israel was during the Second Intifada of the early 2000s when more than 4,300 people died over more than four years of fighting. The CPJ documented the deaths of 13 journalists during that time — a number now surpassed by the latest hostilities. ""This is unprecedented,"" Westcott said. The committee's latest tally is most likely an undercount, as CPJ officials say they are also investigating at least 100 additional reports of journalists killed, missing, detained or threatened. Among those cases are reports of damage done to journalists' offices and homes, Westcott said. ""Based on preliminary reporting, we've also estimated that 48 media facilities in Gaza have been hit or destroyed,"" she said. The Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that sparked the conflict in Gaza resulted in more than 1,400 Israeli deaths and an estimated 5,000 injuries. Israeli airstrikes on Gaza in the days since the attack have killed more than 7,000, according to Palestinian officials. Despite repeated calls for a ceasefire by humanitarian groups and some politicians, the war shows no sign of slowing down as Israeli forces prepare for an expected ground invasion of Gaza — the timing of which remains unclear. The family members of journalists have also become the victims of the ongoing bombardment of Gaza. On Wednesday, Al Jazeera Arabic Bureau Chief Wael Dahdouh's wife, 15-year-old son, 7-year-old daughter and grandson were all killed in an Israeli air raid, according to the outlet. His other son, Yehia, suffered a head injury for which doctors had to perform an emergency procedure in the hallway of the hospital. The network showed images of a shocked Dahdouh entering the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital to see his family in the morgue. ""The indiscriminate assault by the Israeli occupation forces resulted in the tragic loss of [Dahdouh's] wife, son and daughter, while the rest of his family is buried under the rubble,"" Al Jazeera Media Network said in a statement. NPR was not able to independently confirm details of the attack, but Israeli officials have maintained that they do not deliberately target civilians or journalists. In a statement to CNN, the Israel Defense Forces said it had targeted ""Hamas terrorist infrastructure in the area. "" The Arab and Middle Eastern Journalists Association issued a statement this week condemning the recent killing of journalists in Palestinian territories, Israel and Lebanon. ""Targeting journalists is a stark violation of press freedom and international human rights law,"" the press association said. ""AMEJA calls for accountability based on swift, thorough, and transparent investigations into the killings of our fellow journalists. ""The Foreign Press Association similarly called on both Israel and Hamas ""to ensure the safety and freedom of reporting of our Palestinian members on the ground in Gaza, who are reporting the news despite extremely dangerous circumstances. ""Further, the organization called on all authorities ""to ensure the safety of journalists inside Israel, where reporters have been subject to verbal and physical abuse by civilians and security forces on multiple occasions. ""The Palestinian journalists killed were based in Gaza and were ""incredibly vital to the world's understanding of what's going on on the ground in Gaza,"" Westcott said. Most recently, CPJ updated its tally Wednesday to reflect the death of Mohammed Imad Labad, a journalist from the Al Resalah Foundation's news website. He was killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood in Gaza City, according to CPJ. On Monday, Palestinian journalist, filmmaker and Ain Media co-founder Roshdi Sarraj was killed  in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, according to his company. Ain Media called Sarraj  ""a brilliant photo-journalist and film-maker. ""His death came five years after the killing of Ain Media's other co-founder, Yaser Murtaja, by Israeli forces at the border of the Gaza Strip, the company said in a statement. After initially saying they would open an investigation into his death, Israeli officials later said Murtaja was a Hamas militant — a claim his family and colleagues have denied. ""With the killing of Roshdi, Ain Media loses another precious part of its soul. In 2012, Yasser and Roshdi, worked together heart-to-heart on a photo documentary project about daily life in the Gaza Strip, not about death. Gaza is life. Roshdi and Yaser are life: they gave voice to the people of Gaza, to their smiles, to the stories locked in fear, to hopes cherished secretly from the oppression of the Israeli occupation,"" the company said. The death of Sarraj and other colleagues underscore the risks facing journalists based in Gaza. The area has been subject to continuous airstrikes by Israel in response to the Oct. 7 attack. ""Freelance local and photo journalists are particularly at risk, because they not only lack that traditional support of a newsroom, but because of the very nature of their work,"" Westcott said. This often involves capturing images and videos of the fighting and its aftermath, which means getting as close as possible to the danger. The CPJ's investigations have revealed that ""some journalists were shot and killed while reporting on the conflict while some were killed in airstrikes, in some cases, along with their families,"" Westcott said. The CPJ is waiting to see if, or when, a threatened Israeli ground invasion may occur, Westcott said. ""That will certainly change the dynamics for journalists' safety as well,"" she said. Even before the outbreak of this recent war, the Israeli government was under fire by humanitarian groups for the deaths of journalists. Last year, the Israeli military initially denied that one of its soldiers shot and killed Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh of Al Jazeera. At the time she was wearing a helmet and vest that was labeled ""press. "" The CPJ issued a report this year highlighting how her death was not a one-off, but rather part of a long, devastating pattern. The organization's report found that at least 20 journalists have been killed by Israeli military fire since 2001 for which ""to date, no one has been held accountable. "" In the case of Abu Akleh's death, the Israeli authorities have acknowledged Israeli gunfire probably killed the journalist, but they denied soldiers intentionally targeted her.  Beyond the very real risks of gunfire and airstrikes, Westcott said this conflict is also spurring assaults on journalists outside of the front lines. Research by CPJ found that there were more than 10 incidents of assaults, arrests, threats, cyberattacks and censorship targeting journalists as they carry out their work in Israel and in the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank. That includes arrests of Palestinian journalists by the Israel Defense Forces, Westcott said. Israeli journalist Israel Frey went into hiding after ""hundreds of right-wing people stormed my house and tried to hurt me and my children,"" he said in a video he posted from hiding. He's also been subject to a barrage of threatening messages. ""Yes, I am afraid, but I won't break,"" Frey said in the video. ""They went after me because I talked about the need for empathy and prayer for Gaza's children who are being slaughtered. ""CPJ is similarly concerned about new regulations passed in Israel that allows the country's communications minister to shut down foreign media outlets during a state of emergency if there's a belief the outlet damages national security. The Times of Israel reports that the regulations were passed with the goal of shutting down Al Jazeera, which the country's communications minister, Shlomo Karh, has accused of ""incitement against Israel. "" The network has denied his allegations. ""Journalists are themselves civilians in conflicts and they play a vital role in making sure that we can all understand what is going on,"" Westcott said. ""We would just urge that all governments take that very seriously and do their best to protect journalists where they can. The authorities on all sides should publicly commit to recognizing and respecting that. """,npr_articles/article_301.txt,npr_results/article_301.txt.json
302,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/25/1208227647/israel-gaza-hamas-jewish-palestinian-peace-activists-lod,"LOD, Israel — Hanadi Essa Basel has a lot on her plate as the manager of the Mosaic Community Center in Lod, a city of some 80,000 in central Israel. It has transformed its operations to respond to the war: There are psychologists on staff and workshops for young children to help them process emotions in a time of trauma. She called it an ""emergency room"" for anyone affected — ""Jewish and Arab communities alike. ""But when asked about her mission in this moment, as Israel mourns the more than 1,400 people killed in this month's unprecedented attack by Hamas militants and prepares for a major ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, Basel described something more fundamental: ""It's very important for us to go through this period unharmed and safely. ""Lod is a mixed community, where Arabs and Jews live side by side, sometimes in the same building. About 20% of Israel's population is composed of Arabs — or Palestinian citizens of Israel. During the last major escalation in the conflict between Israel and Hamas, Lod was the site of violent clashes between Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel, and the emotional scars haven't fully healed. ""It is hard for me to share, to be honest with you,"" Basel said, ""because it brings out bad and painful memories for both communities in the city. ""Now, tensions are even higher. Activists pushing for peace, a shared society and solidarity between Jews and Arabs say that speaking out has become dangerous — even for simple expressions of condolence for civilian deaths in Gaza, where the Hamas-run health ministry said Israeli airstrikes had killed nearly 6,000 people as of Tuesday. ""It's an incredibly, incredibly tough time,"" said Nadav Shofet, an organizer with Standing Together, a grassroots organization of Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel. Shofet, who is Jewish, said that people in Israel are scared and that there's ""this feeling of having to hunt down people who say anything that sympathizes with people in Gaza or strives towards peace. ""In the city of Haifa last week, police broke up a rally in support of Gaza. ""I am giving you precise instructions: zero tolerance for any incident of incitement — not by a nurse, not by a doctor, not by a singer,"" said Israel's police commissioner, Kobi Shabtai, in a video posted to the Arabic-language TikTok channel for the police. ""Anyone who wants to sympathize with Gaza is welcome to get on a bus and go there. ""After the left-wing journalist Israel Frey recited the Jewish mourner's prayer for dead civilians in Gaza, he says a right-wing mob attacked his home and threatened his wife and children. In a video released on social media last week, he said he was in hiding. ""They went after me because I talked about the need for empathy and prayer for Gaza's children,"" he said. Against that backdrop, Shofet and Standing Together's national co-director Rula Daood arrived at the community center in Lod with a group of volunteers. The main event was a donation drive for people suffering economically from the war — many shops and restaurants have been closed and tourism has dried up. About a dozen people — some wearing headscarves and modest clothing, others in V-neck T-shirts and open-toed shoes — chatted in a mix of Arabic and Hebrew as they packed up boxes with basic groceries. The activists also brought a pile of posters to put up in town, if it felt safe to do so. The day prior, Standing Together activists in Jerusalem tried to put up stickers with a message of Jewish-Arab solidarity, and it didn't go well. ""The police just came in and arrested two of our activists,"" said Daood. The activists in Lod wanted to make a statement, but without putting volunteers or the community center staff at risk. Daood is a Palestinian citizen of Israel who lived in Lod for six years, including during the 2021 unrest, so she understands the potential for danger: ""You would see people just in the streets with guns and wanting to have some kind of — any clash. ""Even small gestures of collaboration between Jews and Arabs like this donation drive are potentially fraught in this moment. ""My husband — he doesn't like me to come here,"" said 64-year-old Smadar Tzimmerman, another volunteer. She's Jewish, and she's retired now, but used to work in Lod as an art therapist, including in Arab schools. She has friends who do peace work, and talking with them fills her with hope, but she admitted that most of Israel doesn't share her views. Two weeks after the Hamas attack, the anger is still palpable. ""When I go to a funeral where everyone is grieving and says, 'Let's kill them,' I will not speak my mind, you know? I just came to comfort them in their sorrow,"" she said. But Tzimmerman still hopes for peace and thinks that building relationships between Jews and Arabs is the only way to achieve it, even if her husband calls her ""a naive woman. """"Being kind to each other, to know each other — it's not such a difficult thing to do, if you are willing to do it,"" she said. ""The problem is, our leaders are not willing to do that. ""It's not only Jewish Israelis who view this approach to peace as wishful thinking. Myada Abu Khaled, a Palestinian citizen of Israel, is an educator and volunteers with children at the community center in Lod. ""No need now for 'Let's do things together,'"" she said, ""rainbow things and unicorns and so on. It won't help. We should be realistic. ""Abu Khaled has spent her entire life around Jews — ""I speak Hebrew as a mother tongue,"" she said — and she has students serving in the Israeli army. ""I'm afraid even to ask about them,"" she said, wiping away tears. She broke down as she recalled a Zoom call earlier that morning with a student in one of her college classes. Friends of the student were killed at the Nova music festival. ""I could feel her hatred upon me,"" Abu Khaled said. ""I really don't judge her, and I really understand her.

303,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/25/1208319352/un-gaza-crisis-diplomatic-friction,"The U. N. Security Council failed to pass a resolution on the Israel-Hamas war, underscoring the tension and division within the council since the conflict broke out. Russia and China vetoed a U. S. resolution that condemned the Oct. 7 attacks, called for the release of hostages and for humanitarian aid for Gaza. The resolution would have also supported Israel's right to defend itself. The vote was 10 in favor, three against and two abstentions. Gilad Erdan, Israel's U. N. ambassador, condemned Russia and China after the vote. ""Those who have voted against the U. S. -led resolution have shown the world that this council is incapable of doing the most basic task of condemning ISIS like terrorists and cannot confirm the right to self-defense of the victim of these heinous crimes,"" he said. A second, failed resolution proposed by Russia, co-sponsored by Sudan and Venezuela, introduced at the last minute, also failed when it didn't get the nine votes needed. Last week, the U. S. vetoed a U. N. resolution calling for a ""humanitarian pause"" in Gaza. U. S. Ambassador to the U. N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said she put forward what she called a more balanced text that condemns ""the heinous terrorist attacks"" by Hamas and reaffirms Israel's right to self-defense. Israeli officials are already furious with the U. N. after comments by Secretary-General António Guterres earlier this week. Guterres on Wednesday said he is ""shocked"" by what he called the misrepresentation of comments he made that offended Israeli leaders and sparked headlines worldwide. The row started on Tuesday, during the U. N. Security Council meeting in New York that played out against the backdrop of deepening misery in Gaza. During his opening remarks, Guterres said it was important ""to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. "" But he also said those grievances could not justify the ""appalling"" attacks. In response, Erdan called for Guterres' resignation, saying he is ""not fit to lead the U. N. "" and called for his country to ""reassess"" its relations with the United Nations. Erdan told Israeli media that the country would deny a visa to a U. N. humanitarian coordinator, saying it was time the body learned ""a lesson. "" Israel's foreign minister later canceled a meeting with Guterres, accusing him of victim blaming. Addressing the media on Wednesday, Guterres said his comments had been taken ""as if I was justifying acts of terror by Hamas,"" when in fact he was saying the opposite. ""I spoke of the grievances of the Palestinian people but I also stated that cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas,"" he stressed, adding ""I believe it is necessary to the record straight — especially out of respect for the victims and their families. ""In Guterres' speech Tuesday, he pleaded with other countries to step up humanitarian aid and to help ensure the conflict doesn't spread to other countries. His pleas came as staggering numbers emerged: thousands dead, even more injured. Roughly 1. 4 million people — 60% of Gaza's population — had left their homes, but remained trapped in the territory. Relief sites overflowed; at one, 400 people shared a single toilet. Hospitals designed for hundreds of patients found themselves treating thousands. The World Health Organization said Wednesday that Gaza's main hospital would stop ""lifesaving operations"" in the evening because of fuel shortages. The WHO said Tuesday that doctors had been performing surgeries without anesthesia or other basic surgical supplies. The U. N. Palestinian refugee agency, UNRWA, said Wednesday that that three of its workers were killed by Israeli strikes in the previous 24 hours, bringing the total number of dead staff members to 38. Israeli officials say there are still 220 hostages being held in Gaza. On Tuesday, the Israeli military dropped leaflets on Gaza urging Palestinians to contact them with information about the hostages, and promising a financial reward along with ""maximum effort in providing security for you and your home. ""  World leaders and humanitarian groups have called on Hamas to release the remaining hostages unconditionally. President Biden on Wednesday urged Israel to embrace its responsibility to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza, but disputed reports that he demanded the country delay its ground offensive. ""What I have indicated to [Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu] is that if that's possible to get these folks out safely, that's what he should do,"" Biden said. ""It's their decision, but I did not demand it. ""It's still unclear when Israel will launch its ground invasion in Gaza, but the Israeli military is ""ready and determined"" for action, military spokesperson Daniel Hagari told Reuters on Tuesday. During a joint news conference with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at the White House, Biden also reiterated the need to work towards a two-state solution, saying Israelis and Palestinians ""equally deserve to live side-by-side in safety, dignity and peace. ""But Biden said there is ""no going back"" to the status quo of Oct. 6, the day before Hamas launched its surprise attack. ""It means a concentrated effort from all the parties — Israelis, Palestinians, regional partners, global leaders — to put us on a path towards peace,"" Biden said.

But the White House is scaling back a bit of its planned celebrations at a gala state dinner — months in the making — because of the crisis in the Middle East. As he welcomed Albanese, Biden noted that the two countries were ""standing with Israel against Hamas's terrorism,"" and Albanese praised Biden for making the case that Palestinian civilians should be protected in Gaza. ""We applaud the personal resolve you have brought to this troubled part of the world,"" Albanese said. First lady Jill Biden had invited Georgia party band the B-52s to be the musical entertainment for the dinner, but she told reporters on Tuesday that she had changed those plans. The band will attend the dinner as guests, but the Army and Air Force Strolling String bands and the U. S. Marine Band will perform instead. ""We are now in a time when so many are facing sorrow and pain, so we made a few adjustments to the entertainment portion of the evening,"" the first lady said. As the Biden administration has worked to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region — its top foreign policy priority — the White House has sought to deepen its ties with Australia. President Biden had planned to visit Australia in May, but had to cancel his trip due to the debt ceiling negotiations. Now, the Middle East crisis is overshadowing the visit meant to honor Albanese. The leaders plan to talk about new investments in critical minerals mining projects, shared research on artificial intelligence, investments in critical minerals mining, and a plan to work with Google to lay subsea cables to expand internet access for Pacific Island nations.

305,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/24/1208217232/israel-survivors-hamas-attack-hotel,"SHEFAYIM, Israel — It's disorienting walking into the Shefayim Hotel along the Mediterranean coast: There is so much life and so much loss. Families lounge on green lawns. Kids play basketball. Dogs are taken on walks through the hotel lobby past a handwritten roster of funerals that keeps getting longer. These are the displaced residents of Kibbutz Kfar Aza. It was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities along the Gaza border in the brutal Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7 that killed more than 1,400 Israelis. Fifty-eight out of the community's 1,000 or so residents were killed; 17 from the community were kidnapped. Now Israel is retaliating across the border with a bombing campaign on Gaza that officials there say has killed more than 5,700 Palestinians. The survivors of Kibbutz Kfar Aza have evacuated, with hundreds of them staying together at this hotel on another kibbutz north of Tel Aviv, wondering: what next?Geologist Bar Elisha sits on a lawn chair in the hotel courtyard. The 41-year-old and his two young daughters were home when the ambush began. He left his house to get his firearm from where it was being stored, but it jammed. Elisha says it's a miracle he survived. ""I heard them,"" he remembers. ""Entering the houses, breaking doors, breaking windows, and just brutalizing everything all around. ""Elisha hid under pillows in his neighbor's shed and listened to the attackers go door to door. ""I was like, oh my God, he's dead. His whole family's dead. I was sure they were murdered in cold blood. Then I heard them moving to the next house, and to the next house,"" he says. Soldiers rescued Elisha 30 hours later, but the scene he emerged to was devastating. Homes had gaping holes. The attackers left behind an aerial photograph with buildings identified as targets. These are just some of the  details that haunt the survivors. ""Our little piece of paradise [has] become pure hell. I don't know how else to put it,"" says media consultant Avidor Schwartzman. He moved to Kfar Aza a couple of months ago with his wife and baby. It had palm trees, a plastics factory, a dining hall — the kibbutz ideal of communal living. There was a waiting list to join, even though it's along the Gaza border, where rocket fire is an occasional part of life. ""When we moved there, we thought it was safe,"" says Schwartzman, who is 37. ""Yeah, there was constant bombing and everything, but we never thought that dozens or even hundreds of terrorists will infiltrate the kibbutz and will start slaughtering entire families in their home, in their beds. ""Schwartzman's wife, Keren Flash, lost both of her parents in the attack — they were killed in their home less than 500 feet away from Schwartzman's home. Schwartzman does not think he will ever go home again. ""We just don't feel safe anywhere right now,"" he says. In Gaza, Palestinians don't have the opportunity to take refuge in a peaceful hotel, and they cannot escape the deadly Israeli bombings. The Israeli survivors at this hotel are relatively safe, but they are living in a kind of limbo. Shiva, the Jewish ritual of mourning at home, can't be done at home. Their home is now uninhabitable. Shiva after shiva is being held in the lobby of a bank on the hotel grounds. Ofer Baram is there, surrounded by dozens of family members and friends, sitting shiva for his son, Aviv, who was a 33-year-old stage manager for popular artists. ""Aviv was the glue that gathered us around him,"" Baram says. ""If Aviv is not there — no reason to live there. ""Libby Shmuel, a volunteer therapist, holds sessions in an office of the bank. She helped treat a man from the kibbutz who did not know where his father's body was. ""He was imagining that his body is . . . in a bag . . . with many, many bags of other bodies. "" Shmuel says, explaining that, for him, it brought to mind scenes from the Holocaust. ""It was so terrible, like Auschwitz, just a very bad image. ""Shmuel, who is 48, specializes in eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, a type of therapy that uses eye movements, knee tapping and guided imagery to overcome trauma. She guided him to visualize his father on a mountain — a place he fell in love with once on a trip abroad. ""He said, 'Dad, goodbye. I love you,'"" says Shmuel. ""And he could see his dad and just give him a hug, and say goodbye to him in a normal and dignified way. And then he got peace. ""Other attack survivors at the Shefayim Hotel find peace in being among their fellow community members, and those who are volunteering their time to support them. ""The human spirit here is so strong,"" says Schwartzman. ""You see the civilians here that are taking care of everything, everything, everything that you need. "" Elisha, the geologist, looks across the hotel lawn toward his daughters and the other families from Kfar Aza. ""I see so many people that I was sure they were dead,"" he says. ""And this is what makes me strong. It strengthens me and makes me feel alive again.

306,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/24/1208170863/israeli-hamas-gaza-hostages,"Follow the latest updates on the Israel-Hamas conflict via NPR's digital live coverage. JERUSALEM — In a remarkable press conference the day after she was released by Hamas, freed Israeli hostage Yocheved Lifshitz described her kidnapping by  militants on Oct. 7 as ""hell. ""Speaking from a wheelchair at the hospital in Tel Aviv, where she is being treated, Lifshitz, 85, recounted her harrowing experience: tied up, thrown over a motorcycle, beaten with a wooden pole, her jewelry stolen as her captors drove her away from Nir Oz, the tiny kibbutz where she lived less than two miles from Israel's border with Gaza. ""I constantly have the images of what happened repeating in my mind,"" Lifshitz said. Lifshitz and Nurit Cooper, 79, were released Monday after an agreement brokered by Egypt and Qatar. There was no indication of why the two women were chosen for release or what, if anything, Hamas received in return. Nor was there word on the hostages that remain, including the two women's husbands. Israeli officials say there are still 220 hostages from the deadly assault by Hamas on Israeli communities around Gaza. Eventually, Lifshitz said, her captors escorted her through a ""spiderweb"" of underground tunnels to a large hall where she was kept for more than two weeks. Hamas provided food, medicine and a doctor to examine the hostages regularly, she said. ""They schooled us with this terrible attack,"" she said, lamenting the fact that Hamas took Israeli security forces by surprise. A video released Monday by Hamas showed the two women being greeted by the International Committee of the Red Cross, which transported them across Gaza's Rafah border with Egypt. In the video, Lifshitz can be seen reaching back out to shake the hand of a Hamas fighter as she says ""shalom,"" the Hebrew word for ""peace"" that is used as a greeting and farewell. On Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces dropped leaflets on Gaza urging Palestinians to contact them with information about the hostages, and promising a financial reward along with ""maximum effort in providing security for you and your home. "" World leaders and humanitarian groups have called on Hamas to release the remaining hostages unconditionally. The U. S. has reportedly advised Israel to delay its much-expected ground invasion of Gaza in order to facilitate the release of the remaining hostages. Israeli military officials say they have not paused their preparations and have emphasized their commitment to eliminating Hamas' military capabilities. ""We want to bring Hamas to the point of full dismantlement,"" Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said in remarks Monday. ""There are tactical, operative, strategic considerations that have provided additional time. And troops who have more time are better prepared, and that is what we are doing now. ""In Gaza, more than 1 million Palestinians heeded Israel's warning to evacuate the northern half of the territory and packed by the dozens into homes, schools and hotels — anywhere with walls and a roof — in the south. But Israel has stepped up the pace of its attacks on the territory, including in the south's densely populated areas in Rafah and Khan Younis. More than 5,700 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in the conflict, Palestinian officials say. ""We live just to live our lives and our dreams, and they killed our neighbors. They're targeting our neighborhood. It's a massacre,"" said Mahmoud Khuwaiter, 30, who is stranded in Gaza. Despite the evacuation notices, Khuwaiter has not yet left Gaza City because it is too difficult to move his 30-some family members, especially his elderly parents, who are in poor health, he told NPR in a voice memo. Instead, he has stayed to see buildings in the area damaged and destroyed, including the apartment where he had been living for only one month as a newlywed with his new wife. The family's food supply has dwindled to some rice and some canned food — not enough to last through tomorrow, he said. ""I'm afraid for my family members to die in front of my eye. I'm afraid for the next day. I'm afraid for the night to come,"" he said. ""All Gazan people think that we are dreaming and we need someone to wake us up, because it's unbelievable. "" Fifty-seven truckloads of aid — mostly food, water and medical supplies — have entered Gaza over the past three days, a ""drop in the ocean,"" according to the U. N. refugee agency.  UNRWA, the United Nations' humanitarian agency in Gaza, reports that it has fewer than 48 hours worth of fuel, and without more soon, it would be unable to distribute aid throughout the territory. Fuel is also needed for generators at bakeries, hospitals and water infrastructure, as Israel put Gaza under a near-total electricity blackout. Relations between the U. N. and Israel are now strained, however, after comments by U. N. Secretary-General António Guterres. Guterres said during the U. N. Security Council meeting Tuesday that the attack by Hamas on Oct. 7 ""did not happen in a vacuum. "" Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen and Israel's ambassador to the U. N. , Gilad Erdan canceled a meeting with Guterres and said their country must ""reassess"" its relations with the U. N. and its officials stationed in the region. ""He doesn't really care for the suffering of the Israeli civilians,"" Erdan said. ""The U. N. is failing and you, Mr. Secretary-General, have lost all morality and impartiality. "" On Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron was in Jerusalem to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before traveling to Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank to meet with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. Many leaders from the West continue to take strong pro-Israeli stances. During the U. N. Security Council meeting, United Kingdom Security Minister Tom Tugendhat expressed steadfast support for Israel's right to self-defense and committed $37 million in aid for Gaza civilians. Russia's Ambassador to the U. N. , Vasily Nebenzya and China's Ambassador Zhang Jun called for a two-state solution. Nebenzya also accused the U. S. of sabotaging potential solutions to the conflict with years of ""destructive positions"" in its relationship with Israel. Qatar, which has taken a lead in mediating negotiations between Israel, Hamas, the U. S. and other countries around the region, called Tuesday for an end to the war without embroiling others in the region into the conflict. ""We say to Israel: Enough is enough. It is not permissible to continue ignoring the reality of occupation, siege and settlement,"" Qatar's emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani wrote on the social media site X. ""We refuse to attack civilians from any party, regardless of their nationality, and we refuse to act as if the lives of Palestinian children do not count, as if they have no faces or names,"" he said. Cohen, the Israeli foreign minister, had his own strong words for Qatar's leaders on Tuesday and accused Qatar of directly funding Hamas for more than a decade. ""They give shelter to their leaders,"" Cohen said. ""The minimum they should do is work to release all the hostages.

307,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/24/1208075395/israel-gaza-hospital-strike-media-nyt-apology,"For the latest updates on the Israel-Hamas war, follow our digital live coverage. When the fog of war envelopes the pursuit of breaking news, the journalism that follows often suffers. The stakes cannot be higher. The sources can prove unreliable. Concrete facts are often scant. And yet readers reward publications that push out information instantaneously. The initial coverage of a deadly blast at a Gaza hospital last week offers a fresh reminder of how hard it can be to get the news right — and what happens when it goes awry. The list of those news organizations that fell short is long and illustrious, including The New York Times, the BBC, Reuters, The Associated Press and more. The news coverage was said to help inspire furious protests across the Middle East that scuttled some of President Biden's efforts at easing tensions through diplomacy. The Israeli government accused the BBC of a ""modern blood libel,"" invoking centuries-old slanders against Jews as killers. That came after the BBC's Jon Donnison told viewers just hours after the incident, ""The Israeli military has been contacted for comment and they say they are investigating. But it is hard to see what else this could be, really, given the size of the explosion, other than an Israeli airstrike or several airstrikes. ""The BBC later issued a statement citing the full breadth of its coverage but saying that the degree of speculation in his report was, in retrospect, wrong. On Monday, The New York Times went further. It publicly acknowledged that its initial coverage had served its readers — and the facts — poorly. It relied upon allegations from Hamas government officials to report that an Israeli missile strike had killed hundreds of civilians at the hospital. ""The report left readers with an incorrect impression about what was known and how credible the account was,"" Times editors wrote. The Israeli government has denied the Hamas claim, asserting the blast came from a failed rocket that they say was fired by the militant group known as Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Israel's stance has since been backed by U. S. and Canadian intelligence assessments. Other outside institutions have cast increasing doubt upon the validity of Hamas' allegations, although it's still not clear what actually happened. Despite its measured tone, The Times' editor's note was an unusual concession by the paper of the magnitude of its failings. ""The early versions of the coverage — and the prominence it received in a headline, news alert and social media channels — relied too heavily on claims by Hamas, and did not make clear that those claims could not immediately be verified,"" it read. The paper said it would re-examine its protocols and safeguards for covering breaking news in light of the incident. The original headline atop the paper's website and sent out in push alerts to millions of subscribers read: ""Israeli Strike Kills Hundreds in Hospital, Palestinians say. "" The Times now reports that almost every element of the accusation is in doubt as Hamas has failed to provide evidence of the Israeli involvement or even the remnants of the explosion. The question of how deadly the blast proved to be — disputed by the Israelis — is also unresolved. The Times is far from alone in relaying the claims of interested parties as facts. Other news outlets also cited Hamas, which governs Gaza, in their coverage of the hospital explosion. In its initial dispatch, Reuters called the blast an ""Israeli air strike,"" citing Gaza officials. The AP cited the ""Health Ministry"" in its headline. Yet Hamas is much more than that. It is deemed by the U. S. and the European Union to be a terrorist organization. Indeed, it just unleashed the most deadly attack in Israeli history, with more than 1,400 people dead, and more than 200 people taken hostage. And Hamas is the source of much of the information — and misinformation — about events in Gaza. Last week, for example, a Hamas spokesman denied in an interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep that militants from the group had slaughtered hundreds of civilians at a music concert in the Israeli desert, despite accounts by survivors, Israeli officials and journalists for major news outlets. (Inskeep pointedly noted that the attackers did kill civilians. )In retaliation, Israel unleashed a wave of strikes. Gaza's health ministry says more than 5,000 people have been killed. That figure underscores the difficulty of reporting on this conflict; given Hamas' authority in Gaza, reporters must seek information and comment from the group — and verify it independently as best they can despite the difficulties. Unlike in some other war zones, such as in Ukraine, it's nearly impossible for outside reporters to get into Gaza, even from Israel. Most news outlets are either covering it remotely or relying on local journalists whose families are themselves at risk from Israeli strikes. The Times' selection of journalists has come under sharp scrutiny in recent days as well. An Israeli diplomat chastised the paper for employing Soliman Hijjy as a freelance videographer in Gaza to document the conflict. On numerous occasions over the past 11 years, Hijjy has praised Adolf Hitler or invoked the Nazi leader in social media postings. A spokesperson for the Times says the paper reviewed those ""problematic"" postings last year, when the issue was first raised, and took actions ""to ensure he understood our concerns and could adhere to our standards. ""The statement says Hijjy has done so and ""has delivered important and impartial work at great personal risk during this conflict. ""For its part, the Israeli government has been accused by human rights groups of hitting civilian targets in the past. And its credibility has also been challenged: For instance, the Israeli military initially denied that one of its soldiers had fired the shot last year that killed the Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh of Al Jazeera. The Israeli military conducted its own investigation and subsequently confirmed that an Israeli soldier had likely fired the lethal shot but did not disclose the shooter's name. A government spokesperson's expression of sorrow for her death, a year later, was deemed insufficient by Abu Akleh's family. (An FBI investigation, opened last year, has not been resolved. )Last week, The Washington Free Beacon's Drew Holden documented a series of prominent news outlets and public figures that appeared to rely on Hamas' claims as authoritative with little or scant acknowledgement of how little had been verified before publication. By contrast, the advocacy group Physicians for Human Rights put out a call on the day of the blast for the protection of civilian life and for the incident to be the subject of an independent investigation. It notably did not project blame. The audiences' perceptions of media outlets' fairness determine how much trust they have — not just in the veracity of specific coverage but the independence of their journalists. Speed may matter a lot to readers, viewers and listeners. Accuracy and fairness still matter more, especially when stakes are so high.",npr_articles/article_307.txt,npr_results/article_307.txt.json
308,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/23/1207946407/gaza-humanitarian-aid-israeli-airstrikes,"The International Committee of the Red Cross said it has facilitated the release of two hostages held by Hamas in Gaza on Monday, amid a multinational effort to free the more than 200 people held captive in Gaza before Israel's expected ground invasion. The Red Cross said the release took place Monday evening. The group did not provide further details on the conditions or health of the newly released hostages. Israeli public broadcaster Kan named the released Israelis as Nurit Yitzhak Cooper and Yocheved Lifshitz — around 80 and 85 years old respectively. Their husbands are reportedly still being held in Gaza. It's the second hostage release since militants invaded southern Israel and abducted them two and a half weeks ago. The first hostages to be released were  Judith Raanan, 59, and Natalie Raanan, 17, a mother and daughter from Illinois. The pair were freed on Friday, the result of negotiations between the U. S. , Israel, Hamas and Qatar. Israel said 220 hostages are still held captive in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces said the military struck over 320 military targets on Sunday, with a focus on Hamas headquarters, tunnels and firing positions in Gaza. The overnight airstrikes killed more than 200 people, including in Rafah and Khan Younis, two cities in the south of Gaza that are crowded full of Palestinians who have evacuated from the northern part of the territory at Israel's urging. More than half of Gaza's population of some 2. 2 million people has been displaced from their homes, according to the United Nations. According to Gaza's Ministry of Health, the Palestinian death toll from Israeli airstrikes has reached 5,087 since the start of the conflict. Fighting outside Gaza has also escalated. Over the weekend, several Israeli towns near the Israel-Lebanon border were evacuated amid rocket exchanges and gunfire with the Iranian-backed militant group, Hezbollah. Israel has also increased its airstrikes in the West Bank — a rarity prior to the current conflict — in what it says is an effort to fight off Hamas. After an initial delivery of 20 truckloads worth of aid Saturday, another 14 followed on Sunday. An additional shipment of 20 trucks entered Monday, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. But humanitarian workers say the relief is not nearly enough. The shipment of 14 trucks amounts to about 3% of what would normally cross the border each day before the hostilities began, according to the U. N. The trucks contain medicine and other medical supplies, along with food and water. But no fuel has been allowed to enter Gaza. For normal Palestinians, gasoline and diesel have become nearly impossible to obtain, limiting their mobility. Many families report that their only remaining fuel is what is left in their vehicle's tank. With Gaza's main power plant still out of operation, fuel is also needed to power generators for critical infrastructure, including hospitals, desalination plants and wastewater treatment facilities. An emergency supply of fuel held by the U. N. 's relief agency for Palestinians, known as UNRWA, will be exhausted within a few days, officials have warned. ""Without fuel, there will be no water, no functioning hospitals and bakeries. Without fuel, aid will not reach those in desperate need. Without fuel, there will be no humanitarian assistance,"" said Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA's commissioner-general, in a statement issued Sunday. ""Without fuel, we will fail the people of Gaza whose needs are growing by the hour, under our watch. ""Virtually every medical specialty in Gaza has run out of supplies, said Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitta, a British Palestinian surgeon working at al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest medical center. An estimated 14,000 wounded ""have consumed all of the supplies in the system, from the medication to the equipment to everything you can imagine is required to care for such traumatic injuries and such critically ill patients,"" he told NPR. ""Not only are the supplies consumed, but also the staff has been consumed,"" he added. UNRWA said on Monday that 35 members of its staff have been killed in Gaza since Oct. 7. ""Many were teachers in our schools,"" the agency said. President Biden has not called for a cease-fire in the conflict. Reporters asked him Monday whether the U. S. would support a cease-fire in exchange for release of hostages. ""We should have those hostages released and then we can talk,"" he said. A group of Western leaders issued a joint statement Sunday reiterating support for Israel's ""right to defend itself against terrorism"" while also calling for the country to adhere to humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians. More than 1,400 Israelis were killed in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks. The statement came after a phone call between Biden, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of the United Kingdom. The leaders committed to coordinating with partners in the region to ensure aid reached those in Gaza, as well as ""close diplomatic coordination, including with key partners in the region, to prevent the conflict from spreading, preserve stability in the Middle East, and work toward a political solution and durable peace,"" the statement reads. The comments from Western leaders came after Biden held a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, during which the two agreed to a ""continued flow"" of aid into Gaza, the White House said. The conversation was just one of dozens Netanyahu has had with world leaders in recent days.

309,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/23/1207898416/palestinian-christians-gaza-church,"JERUSALEM — Across the Holy Land on Sunday, Christian churches dedicated services to the victims of an Israeli airstrike that killed more than a dozen people sheltering at a Greek Orthodox church in Gaza. In recent years, the Church of St. Porphyrius in Gaza City had come to serve as a shelter in times of conflict between Israel and militants in Gaza, including Hamas, the group that earlier this month unleashed the deadliest attack on Israeli civilians in the country's history. Over the past two weeks, as Israeli airstrikes have hammered Gaza in retaliation, hundreds of Palestinians sought safety at the church — most of them members of a small but prominent Palestinian Christian minority. On Thursday, an Israeli airstrike damaged part of the church compound. Palestinian officials say 18 people were killed in the strike. All but one were Christian, those affiliated with the church said, a total that amounted to nearly two percent of Gaza's Christian population. In a statement Friday, the Israel Defense Forces said their target was a building near the church that they said was being used by Hamas as a command center to launch rockets at Israel. The church sanctuary itself was not struck. ""The IDF can unequivocally state that the Church was not the target of the strike,"" the statement said. ""I don't think that is an excuse to hit these places near a church where people are hiding,"" said Rev. Fadi Diab, an Anglican minister based in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. At least 400 people were taking shelter at the church complex on Thursday, Oct. 20, witnesses said. The church grounds include its historic sanctuary, which dates to the 12th century, along with several other buildings and a courtyard. About a quarter of those at the complex were inside an office building near the church sanctuary, said Kamel Ayyad, a churchgoer who lives nearby. That night, Ayyad was at home with his young daughters when he heard a first strike, then a second, he said. ""We never expected that the church would get bombed,"" he said. Soon after the building was hit, churchgoers and other Palestinians rushed to the heap of concrete slabs and debris in an attempt to rescue those trapped in the rubble. ""It was very painful to hear 'my mother is inside,' 'my son is inside,' 'my sister is inside,' "" said Elias al-Jeldah, a Palestinian Christian who arrived on the scene shortly after the airstrike. ""People were frantic. People were so scared. ""Among the dead were several relatives of former U. S. Rep. Justin Amash, whose father is Palestinian. ""The Palestinian Christian community has endured so much. Our family is hurting badly,"" he wrote on the social media site X. In spite of Thursday's strike, hundreds of people have continued to shelter at the St. Porphyrius Church in the days since. Palestinian Christians who chose to remain at the Orthodox church and the nearby Catholic church said they felt they had nowhere else to go, even as Israel has urged people to evacuate from Gaza City to the southern half of the territory. The church ""seems to be the only place that can take us,"" said Ayyad. ""We Christians have no one in the south. ""Among the churches holding services to memorialize those killed in Gaza was one of the most sacred sites in Christianity: the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the site in Jerusalem's Old City that is said to be where Jesus was crucified, buried and resurrected. There, on Sunday, steps away from the elaborate marble shrine that surrounds what many believe to be Jesus' tomb, the patriarch of Jerusalem and All Palestine — the branch of Orthodoxy to which the St. Porphyrius Church belongs — held a prayer service for the victims. ""The survivors of this horrific bombing are resilient and filled with the spirit of Christ,"" Theophilos III said in a statement. ""Together with them we continue to display faith through the aftermath of this horrific ordeal. ""At another church near Bethlehem, hours after the Sunday service had to come to an end, one family was still grieving. Basheer, who asked NPR to use only his first name out of concern for his family's safety, said his wife's sister was one of those who had sheltered at the Gaza church. But she was killed, along with her 6-month-old grandchild, according to Basheer and another witness of the strike's aftermath. By sheltering at the church, she thought she was escaping death, Basheer said, but it found her anyway. ""Maybe she chose the right place to be, as a Christian, a believer, beside Jesus Christ,"" he added. Every Palestinian, be them Christian or Muslim, feels the same way these days, he said — hopeless. ""This is our way of living,"" he said. ""It's all tragedies, all sadness.

310,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/22/1207857213/israel-intensifies-bombing-in-the-gaza-strip-with-further-strikes-in-the-west-ba,"A second installment of humanitarian aid arrived in Gaza on Sunday as Israel intensified its bombing campaign in the region. COGAT, the Israeli military agency in charge of Palestinian civil affairs, said essential supplies provided by the United Nations entered the southern Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing in Egypt. The shipment only included water, food and medical equipment, and it was inspected by Israeli security officials prior to entering Gaza. A United Nations official said on social media that 14 trucks entered Gaza. About 17 trucks were seen near the Rafah crossing earlier on Sunday. In the first shipment of assistance, 20 trucks were let into Gaza from Egypt on Saturday. The White House said President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone on Sunday and ""affirmed that there will now be continued flow of this critical assistance into Gaza. ""Meanwhile, Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari signaled that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would be stepping up its airstrikes in Gaza. ""We will deepen our attacks to minimize the dangers to our forces in the next stages of the war. We are going to increase the attacks, from today,"" Hagari said. He called on Gaza's residents to move south ""for your own safety. "" Overnight raids on the Gaza Strip killed at least 55 people, the Hamas government said on Sunday. More than 4,650 people have been killed in Gaza in the past two weeks, including more than 1,870 children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Israel has confirmed that 212 people are being held hostage in Gaza. An additional 100 people are listed as missing. A spokesperson for Hamas' military wing, Abu Obeida, said the group was willing to free two more hostages for humanitarian reasons. It comes after the release of two Americans on Friday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed those efforts, but also stressed that every hostage needs to be freed now and ""unconditionally. """"Acts are what speak, not words, particularly coming from Hamas,"" Blinken said Sunday on Meet the Press. Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Richard Hecht said on Sunday that Israeli strikes overnight had killed dozens of Palestinian fighters, including the deputy chief of Hamas rocket forces. According to Reuters, many Palestinians said they had received renewed warnings from Israel's military via leaflets and phone messages to move from north Gaza to the south of the enclave, with the added message that they ""might be identified as an accomplice in a terrorist organization"" if they stayed put. However, there have also been strikes in the south of Gaza, making it unclear whether moving is truly safe. The Israeli attacks come after Hamas militants carried out a cross-border attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,400 people, mainly civilians. The Israeli military said about 7,000 rockets have been fired at Israel since the war broke out more than two weeks ago. For many days, Israeli forces have seemed to be prepared for a possible ground invasion of Gaza. About 700,000 Palestinians have complied with the order to evacuate the northern Gaza Strip, the IDF said. On Saturday, Arab leaders, European officials and the U. N. secretary-general met in Cairo to discuss the war. All of them called for international law to be upheld, but leaders at the peace summit failed to agree on any action to de-escalate the conflict. Part of the challenge was that key players, including Israel and Iran, did not attend the conference. The U. S. , which vetoed a U. N. call for a ceasefire in Gaza, sent only a lower-level official. ""The message the Arab world is hearing is loud and clear: Palestinian lives matter less than Israeli ones,"" Jordan's King Abdullah said in English, in hopes that his message will reach Americans and Europeans. Leaders at the summit did agree that they want to see a two-state solution, one along the lines that was agreed to by Israel and Palestinian leaders in the 1990s. The lack of a Palestinian homeland is seen as one of biggest drivers of instability in Middle East. Israel said that overnight it hit a ""terrorist compound"" in Jenin in the West Bank, allegedly including ""operatives"" from a Hamas cell within a mosque, who were allegedly planning attacks. The strike was part of surging violence in the West Bank, as the Israeli military pursues Palestinian militants. At least 90 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli-occupied territory in the past two weeks, mainly in clashes with Israeli troops, according to AP. The tally includes five Palestinians killed in separate incidents on Sunday. Israel carried out an airstrike during a battle in another West Bank refugee camp last week, in which 13 Palestinians, including five minors, and a member of Israel's paramilitary Border Police were killed. Unlike in Gaza, Israel rarely uses air power in the occupied West Bank. Israel says its forces have detained over 700 suspects in the West Bank, including 480 members of Hamas, since the start of hostilities. Meanwhile, Israel also carried out strikes on Hezbollah targets on the border with Lebanon on Saturday, after one Israeli soldier was hit by an anti-tank missile in northern Israel. ""We are in the heart of the battle today,"" said Hezbollah's deputy leader, Sheikh Naim Kassem, on Saturday, the same day that the group said six of its fighters were killed. To the northeast, Syrian state media reported that Israeli airstrikes early Sunday targeted the international airports of the Syrian capital Damascus and the northern city of Aleppo, killing one person. The runways were damaged and put out of service. The Israeli military had no immediate comment. Late on Saturday, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin made a statement signaling further U. S. presence in the region. He said the Pentagon is sending an anti-ballistic missile defense system called the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) to the Middle East, as well as additional Patriot air defense missile system battalions. The U. S. has deployed a significant amount of naval power to the area in recent weeks, including two aircraft carriers, their support ships and about 2,000 Marines. Humanitarian efforts are still focusing on aid convoys to the Gaza Strip after some aid finally got through to the enclave. Twenty trucks carrying medicine, medical supplies and food crossed into Gaza on Saturday morning from Egypt, marking the first humanitarian aid to arrive in the enclave since an Israeli bombardment campaign began two weeks ago. Loaded on the trucks were medical supplies for trauma treatment and chronic disease, the World Health Organization said Saturday. The delivery also included some food, mattresses and blankets. Notably, no fuel arrived, which aid groups say is needed to power hospitals and desalination plants for much-needed water. Lynn Hastings, U. N. Humanitarian Coordinator in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, told NPR that the arrival of the trucks Saturday ""represents a very small first but important start. Obviously it's really a drop in the bucket. ""As the trucks made their way through the Rafah border, hundreds of foreign nationals gathered on the Gaza side, hoping to escape the violence. But no one was allowed to leave. Aid agencies are hoping that more supplies will be delivered in the coming days, with 100 trucks sitting on the Egyptian side of the border. U. S. officials estimate that hundreds of American citizens are stranded in Gaza. Settler violence against Palestinians has also intensified since the Hamas attack. At least five Palestinians have been killed by settlers, according to Palestinian authorities, and rights groups say settlers have torched cars and attacked several small Bedouin communities, forcing them to evacuate to other areas.

311,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/21/1207138183/israel-gaza-hamas-idf-invasion-troops-supplies,"Barely 24 hours after the Hamas attack on Israel, Etai Iam Rimer threw himself into volunteering. He had spent the day of the attack at home in Kfar Truman, southeast of Tel Aviv, glued to the news on TV and social media, scared and stunned, as stories of massacred civilians and videos of kidnappings slowly emerged. When he woke up the next morning, he knew: ""I don't want to do another day like that. "" He wanted to do something useful. At first, that meant a spontaneous drive south with friends, to the hardest hit areas in Israel. They took pizza to soldiers and delivered food to people who were still afraid to leave their homes. Within days it had grown into a huge volunteer aid effort — now at 4,000 members, Rimer said — and a WhatsApp group where people displaced or otherwise affected by the war could ask for things they needed and be matched with donors. Very quickly, Rimer noticed something unusual. Many of the requests were from family members of soldiers, requesting basic gear or supplies. ""Everything you can imagine,"" he said, ""from vests to knee protectors to helmets to flashlights to underwear. "" And Rimer said these were huge requests: hundreds of items for entire units. Israel has called up hundreds of thousands of reserve troops, in preparation for a ground invasion of Gaza. Those soldiers will be headed into dangerous, urban combat, and high casualties are expected of Israeli soldiers, Hamas militants and Gazan civilians. Across the country, a huge volunteer effort has sprung up to supply troops with protective gear that some say the government is failing to provide. ""There is zero organization. That's how I feel as a citizen,"" Rimer said. ""We are doing everything we can, but the government is just not. ""Rimer's group is just one of many that has worked to get donated supplies to soldiers, from both inside and outside Israel. On Tuesday at Boston Logan International Airport, volunteers approached passengers lined up to check into an El Al flight to Tel Aviv. They had giant boxes and duffel bags filled with donations for troops and were sending them with volunteers as checked luggage. This image, of a grassroots effort plugging holes in the military supply chain, is not the one Israel wants to project. Its military is a source of national pride, and service is mandatory for most citizens. And the government is attuned to the public cry for supplies. After Israeli media started reporting on the issue, the Ministry of Defense put out a statement saying tens of thousands of items were on their way. Helmets, bulletproof vests, knee protectors and more. It's also been releasing photos of supplies arriving from abroad. In a statement to NPR, the Israel Defense Forces highlighted a round-the-clock hotline set up for military personnel to report equipment deficiencies or shortages and emphasized that it is providing ""full logistical support for both mandatory and reserve soldiers, including medical gear, personal essentials, and combat supplies, all tailored to meet operational demands within the IDF. ""Many Israelis are skeptical of the military's reassurances. The Hamas massacre shattered many Israelis' belief that the government could keep them safe, and now they're asking if the government is falling short in this area, too. ""Unfortunately this war has shown us that not only we had problems in the intelligence part of the army, but a lot of the backstage collapsed as well,"" said Michal Geva. ""Unfortunately, I would say everything. ""Geva runs a venture fund when she's not helping with the war effort. Now she's part of a volunteer corps of thousands of people at the Expo Tel Aviv International Convention Center, which has become a hub for a huge range of volunteer projects in response to the war. Their efforts go well beyond supplying soldiers, and include everything from mental health counseling to missing persons investigations. Geva's organization is focused on rescues. Members of her team drove to towns in southern Israel and rescued people who'd been hiding in safe rooms — some of them for nearly 24 hours. She said that normally civil organizations get ""in between the cracks of what the government infrastructure can provide,"" but in this case they've essentially taken on government functions. ""We're like their extended arm instead of it being vice versa. ""This volunteer operation grew out of the mass protest movement that had been demonstrating every week for 10 months against Israel's far-right religious government and its efforts to weaken the judiciary. But now it includes people of every political leaning. Maya Armon, a filmmaker and MBA student who created a donation hub at the Expo, remains a fierce critic of the government. She has friends in the army and has heard the requests from soldiers for everything from underwear to tactical gear. ""It is embarrassing!"" she said. In her view, the work that volunteers are doing at the Expo should be the government's responsibility. But she also said the effort had built a sense of unity. ""It feels like it's different now that everyone collaborates with each other,"" she said. ""And it's amazing. I just wish that it will remain afterwards. ""For Terry Newman, a press liaison for the volunteer effort at the Expo, the operation is a source of great pride. In a cavernous parking garage thrumming with activity, he points out piles of clothes, boxes of toys and puzzles, and lines of car seats donated for displaced families. ""You should also know that people are donating cars,"" he said. He sees the work at the Expo as a sign that the country is coming together in this crisis and channeling its pain into something useful. ""When you're under the kind of post-traumatic stress that people are going through — having seen the massacre that happened in people's houses with their children — they want to be busy. They want to be doing things,"" Newman says. For Shir Shalom, who came to the Expo to volunteer with her husband and son, the question of whether the government should be handling this relief work was beside the point. Israelis are used to recovery, she said. ""This really is the nature of this country. This is us. ""Inside the Gaza Strip, civilians are also anticipating a possible ground invasion, but are cut off from nearly all outside aid. As of Saturday, days of diplomatic pressure from President Biden and the United Nations only managed to secure access for 20 trucks worth of supplies — for a population of 2. 2 million. And they are running out of basics like food, water and medicine — let alone protective gear.",npr_articles/article_311.txt,npr_results/article_311.txt.json
312,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/21/1207783685/celebrities-letter-ceasefire-israel-gaza-biden,"Dozens of entertainment industry A-listers have signed a letter urging President Biden to push for an immediate de-escalation and cease-fire as the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues into its third week. Created by a group of Hollywood insiders calling itself Artists4Ceasefire, the letter's signatories so far include such celebrities as Cate Blanchett, America Ferrera, Bassem Youssef, Jon Stewart, Dua Lipa, Hasan Minhaj, Oscar Isaac and Michael Stipe. ""We urge your administration, and all world leaders, to honor all of the lives in the Holy Land and call for and facilitate a ceasefire without delay – an end to the bombing of Gaza, and the safe release of hostages,"" the letter states. It goes on to note: ""Half of Gaza's two million residents are children, and more than two thirds are refugees and their descendants being forced to flee their homes. Humanitarian aid must be allowed to reach them. ""Some signees, such as Ferrera, have also shared their views on the conflict in other forums. Speaking at Glamour's Global Honourees' Women of the Year Awards a few days ago, the Barbie and How to Train Your Dragon actor called for the conflict to end, and for women and children to ""live in peace. """"All of our sisters are not safe,"" Ferrera said. ""Like all of you, my heart is broken and heavy with the weight of what our sisters around the world endure every day. And as we sit here tonight celebrating, our sisters and their families in Gaza and Israel are living through horror. The brutality of terror and war is unfolding before our eyes. Entire families have been and continue to be erased. ""The Artists4Ceasefire letter isn't the only such act of celebrity political advocacy to have emerged over the past couple of weeks. Hundreds of celebrities, such as actors Gal Gadot, Michael Douglas and Jerry Seinfeld, signed an open letter supporting Israel published on Oct. 12. That effort, organized by the Creative Community for Peace, which describes itself as ""a non-profit entertainment industry organization,"" states its mission is ""to promote the arts as a bridge to peace, to educate about rising antisemitism within the entertainment industry, and to galvanize support against the cultural boycott of Israel. ""The Biden administration has so far not issued any public statements in response to this or any other letter sharing the views of celebrities on the conflict. Biden has reiterated the ""unwavering U. S. support for Israel"" in recent statements and has supported Israel's retaliation for the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. The White House has not specifically called for a cease-fire but has called for minimizing civilian casualties. Also, on Oct. 18, Biden announced the United States is providing $100 million in humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank. This is not the first time celebrities have voiced their opinions about the worsening state of Israeli-Palestinian relations. For instance, Gadot posted comments on her Instagram account following an escalation in violence in the region in May 2021. ""This is a vicious cycle that has been going on for far too long,"" Gadot wrote. ""Israel deserves to live as a free and safe nation. Our neighbors deserve the same. "" Meanwhile, at that time, Susan Sarandon expressed her support for Palestinians. In one on Twitter post, the actor and activist forwarded a statement describing Israel's actions as ""settler colonialism, military occupation, land theft and ethnic cleansing. ""The public has been divided about whether entertainers should air their political views. A poll from the survey company Morning Consult showed that 28% of adults want celebrities to speak up on political issues, while 29% said celebrities should stay out of politics. The Israel-Gaza war, which began on Oct. 7 with a devastating attack by Hamas on Israel, has led to the deaths of more than 1,400 Israelis and more than 4,000 Palestinians to date. Here is the Artists4Ceasefire letter and current list of signatories in full:Dear President Biden,We come together as artists and advocates, but most importantly as human beings witnessing the devastating loss of lives and unfolding horrors in Israel and Palestine. We ask that, as President of the United States, you call for an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire in Gaza and Israel before another life is lost. More than 5,000 people have been killed in the last week and a half – a number any person of conscience knows is catastrophic. We believe all life is sacred, no matter faith or ethnicity and we condemn the killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians. We urge your administration, and all world leaders, to honor all of the lives in the Holy Land and call for and facilitate a ceasefire without delay – an end to the bombing of Gaza, and the safe release of hostages. Half of Gaza's two million residents are children, and more than two thirds are refugees and their descendants being forced to flee their homes. Humanitarian aid must be allowed to reach them. We believe that the United States can play a vital diplomatic role in ending the suffering and we are adding our voices to those from the US Congress, UNICEF, Doctors without Borders, The International Committee of The Red Cross, and so many others. Saving lives is a moral imperative. To echo UNICEF, ""Compassion — and international law — must prevail. ""As of this writing more than 6,000 bombs have been dropped on Gaza in the last 12 days - resulting in one child being killed every 15 minutes. ""Children and families in Gaza have practically run out of food, water, electricity, medicine and safe access to hospitals, following days of air strikes and cuts to all supply routes. Gaza's sole power plant ran out of fuel Wednesday afternoon, shutting down electricity, water and wastewater treatment. Most residents can no longer get drinking water from service providers or household water through pipelines. . . . The humanitarian situation has reached lethal lows, and yet all reports point to further attacks. Compassion — and international law — must prevail.

313,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/21/1207795093/ceo-of-web-summit-tech-conference-resigns-over-israel-comments,"The chief executive of one of the world's largest technology conferences resigned on Saturday amid furor over remarks he made about the Israel-Hamas war sparked a boycott that led to droves of speakers and companies to pull out of the gathering. Organizers for Web Summit, which drew more than 70,000 attendees last year, said the event will still take place in Lisbon next month and that a new CEO will soon be appointed. Paddy Cosgrave, the Irish entrepreneur who founded Web Summit and has been running the event since 2009, announced his departure after a flurry of companies, including Google, Meta, Amazon and Intel, withdrew from the event in the wake of Cosgrave's comments. Last week, he wrote on X that he was shocked at the rhetoric of so many Western leaders and governments in response to Israel's bombardment of Gaza following the Hamas terrorist attack that killed more than 1,300 people. ""War crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies, and should be called out for what they are,"" Cosgrave wrote, referring to Israel's wave of attacks on Gaza after the violence committed by Hamas. The statement set off outrage, with venture capitalists, Israeli startup founders and Big Tech companies all pulling out of Web Summit, an annual conference that for the past 14 years has brought together some of the industry's top leaders and companies. David Marcus, a former Facebook executive who oversaw the company's cryptocurrency project, was among those who criticized Cosgrave, writing on X: ""Saddened by your ill-informed stance. You could've taken a more nuanced one, condemning these atrocities and calling for restraint. That would've been acceptable. You chose to support terrorists. As such I'll never attend/sponsor/speak at any of your events again. "" As a boycott movement gained momentum, Cosgrave attempted to walk back his comments with a post on X: ""We are devastated to see the terrible killings and the level of innocent civilian casualties in Israel and Gaza. We condemn the attacks by Hamas and extend our deepest sympathies to everyone who has lost loved ones. We hope for peaceful reconciliation. ""But he then doubled down on his previous remark, saying: ""To repeat: War crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies & should be called out for what they are. "" As more backed out of the event, Cosgrave issued an apology in hopes of containing the fallout. He wrote that: ""I understand that what I said, the timing of what I said, and the way it has been presented has caused profound hurt to many. ""Pressure kept mounting, however, and on Saturday, Cosgrave announced that he was stepping aside as the leader of Web Summit. ""Unfortunately, my personal comments have become a distraction from the event, and our team, our sponsors, our startups and the people who attend,"" he wrote on the event's website. Web Summit was originally held in Dublin but moved in 2015 to Lisbon. In his apology, Cosgrave wrote that he ""unequivocally"" supported Israel's right to defend itself, adding that ""like so many figures globally, I also believe that, in defending itself, Israel should adhere to international law and the Geneva Conventions – i. e. not commit war crimes. ""It is unclear what will happen to Cosgrave's ownership stake in Web Summit, which is about 81%, according to its corporate filing in Ireland.

314,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/21/1207781842/london-pro-palestinian-protests-gaza,"Tens of thousands of protesters marched through central London on Saturday, one of several cities worldwide that's seen widespread anger over the actions of Israel's military inside Gaza spill out into the streets. British police estimated that up to 100,000 marchers participated in a rain-soaked rally that started near the city's largest central park and continued down to Whitehall, close to the Parliament and the Downing Street residence of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Counter-terrorism officers were among the one thousand police monitoring the march, watching for signs of support for either Hamas or Hezbollah, both of which are banned in the U. K. But police said a chant first used by the Palestine Liberation Organization — ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"" — would be allowed on free-speech grounds, even though Hamas has since adopted it. Police said they would intervene if the chant was used near Jewish cultural centers or synagogues, or was directed at members of the city's Jewish community. It is more than two weeks since Hamas attacked communities and killed roughly 1,300 people in southern Israel, and its military responded with artillery and aerial bombardments of the Gaza Strip. Aid for those inside the besieged Palestinian enclave was only permitted to enter for the first time on Saturday, with several trucks carrying medical supplies and food. The crowds in London carried Palestinian flags, with participants demanding that Israel end the siege and discontinue airstrikes that have killed more than 4,000 Palestinians and forced more than a million Gazans from their homes. Ahead of the march, officials in the U. K. urged those demonstrating to be conscious of the feelings and grief that many members of Britain's Jewish communities are feeling as well. In a statement, London's Metropolitan Police said the majority of the protest march had taken place lawfully and without incident, but there had also been several ""pockets of disorder and some instances of hate speech. "" The force has recorded a massive 1,300% increase in reported antisemitic offenses this month, compared to October last year, while reported anti-Muslim crimes have also more than doubled in the same period. Earlier a German news agency reported that police leaders in Berlin had pre-emptively banned a similar pro-Palestinian rally that had been planned for Sunday, after clashes in recent days between police officers and pro-Palestinian demonstrators. But authorities have allowed a demonstration in support of Israel to gather in the German capital on Sunday. Other pro-Palestinian demonstrations took place in Rome and Sydney, as they have recently in Washington, D. C. , the Jordanian capital of Amman, in Beirut and right across Muslim-majority countries like Morocco, Turkey, Malaysia and Bangladesh.",npr_articles/article_314.txt,npr_results/article_314.txt.json
315,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/21/1207753842/egypt-gaza-border-crossing-opens,"JERUSALEM — Twenty trucks carrying medicine, medical supplies and food crossed into Gaza on Saturday morning from Egypt, marking the first humanitarian aid to arrive in the territory since an Israeli bombardment campaign began two weeks ago. As the trucks made their way through the Rafah border, hundreds of foreign nationals gathered at the Gaza side, hoping to escape the violence that has beset the Palestinian territory. But by the afternoon, it had become clear that no one would be allowed to leave for now. For two weeks since the Gaza-based militant group Hamas launched a wave of deadly attacks on Israel, Israel's retaliatory airstrikes have damaged and destroyed thousands of buildings across Gaza, including homes, schools and U. N. -operated shelters. Israeli military officials say the strikes are targeted at Hamas militants and infrastructure. An Israeli siege has cut off the flow of food, water, electricity and fuel to the territory, intensifying a humanitarian crisis. About a million Palestinians — roughly half of Gaza's population — have fled their homes to seek shelter elsewhere inside Gaza. But with borders closed, none had been able to leave the territory. Loaded on the trucks were medical supplies for trauma treatment and chronic disease, the World Health Organization said Saturday. ""These supplies are a lifeline for severely injured people or those battling chronic illnesses, who have endured a harrowing two weeks of limited access to care and severe shortages of medicines and medical supplies,"" the WHO said in a statement. The delivery also included some food, mattresses and blankets, according to aid workers at the Rafah border crossing. Notably, no fuel arrived, which aid groups say is needed to power hospitals and desalination plants for much-needed water. Lynn Hastings, U. N. Humanitarian Coordinator in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, told NPR that the arrival of the trucks Saturday ""represents a very small first but important start. Obviously it's really a drop in the bucket. ""She said that in addition to water, food and medicine, fuel is also critical. ""I know that fuel is a riskier item because it can be used in a number of different ways, but without fuel we won't have the hospitals running, desalination plants won't run, hygiene will continue to suffer, and, of course, for the trucks that have to deliver the aid,"" Hastings said. She said the U. N. will continue to work with the Israeli government ""to make sure fuel can come in safely and in a controlled manner so it's used for the purposes it is intended. ""The 20 trucks represent a U. N. -brokered deal urged along by world leaders, including President Biden, who visited Israel this week. Among the concerns delaying the aid were Israel's fear that Hamas could intercept it or use the trucks to smuggle in weapons. But aid groups have warned that 20 truckloads do not come close to addressing the humanitarian needs in Gaza, where the U. N. reports a severe shortage of potable water, food and medical supplies. More than 100 additional trucks of aid continue to stand by on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing. Additional aid is stockpiled in nearby El-Arish, with yet more set to arrive later today and in the days to come, the WHO said. ""They are the difference between life and death for so many people in Gaza,"" said U. N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during a Friday visit to the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing. ""And to see them stuck here makes me be very clear: What we need is to make them move, to make them move to the other side of this wall. ""In a statement Saturday, President Biden thanked the leaders of Egypt and Israel and the United Nations in allowing the assistance to go through. He added that the U. S. will ""continue to work with all parties to keep the Rafah crossing in operation to enable the continued movement of aid that is imperative to the welfare of the people of Gaza. "" U. S. officials estimate that hundreds of American citizens are stranded in Gaza. Early on Saturday morning, the U. S. State Department alerted them by email and phone call of the border's opening but warned that anyone attempting to cross should expect ""a potentially chaotic and disorderly environment on both sides of the crossing. ""Saturday's notice was the third such alert from the State Department since the hostilities began. But no American citizens have been allowed to cross the border.  Department officials say they are ""working tirelessly"" to help American citizens leave Gaza. ""We continue to work urgently in partnership with Egypt and Israel to facilitate the ability of U. S. citizens and their immediate family members to exit Gaza safely and travel via Egypt to their final destinations,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Saturday. Those who came to Rafah on Saturday told NPR they have grown skeptical of the alerts, and they urged the State Department to do more to help Americans evacuate. Wafa Elsaka, a retired elementary school teacher from Tallahassee, Fla. , answered the State Department's phone call as she already stood at the Rafah crossing. ""This is the third time coming in here according to your emails to say it's open,"" she said. ""So hopefully it's the charm. ""Abood Okal, a Palestinian-American who lives in Massachusetts, had come to Gaza with his wife, Wafaa Abuzayda, and their 1-year-old son on what was supposed to be a two-week trip to visit family. ""The way that American citizens are being treated in Gaza is a shame on this government and on the State Department,"" he said. Their cars are almost out of fuel, he said. With gasoline and diesel impossible to obtain in Gaza, the repeated drives to and from the border are unsustainable, he said. Food and water have also grown more difficult to find, he added. Like many other people in Gaza, both Okal and Elsaka had moved to southern Gaza ever since Israelis urged the evacuation of the northern part of the territory. Now, Okal and his family are among the 40 or so people staying in a single-family home in rural Rafah, he said. Elsaka said she was staying with 50 other people in a home in Khan Younis, southern Gaza's largest city. But nowhere in Gaza is safe from Israeli airstrikes, Elsaka said. A house was struck recently only two doors down from the home where she has been staying with dozens of other people, she added. ""I'm scared when the night comes in, because we can't see where it's happening. And I'm scared when the daylight comes out, because I'm going to see what is going to happen,"" she said. ""This is an open grave for the people in Gaza. ""By the afternoon, border officials had returned the concrete bollards to the crossing, an indication that no more traffic would be allowed through. The 300 people who had come resigned themselves to the fact their stay in Gaza was not yet over. ""On one side, we remain hopeful,"" Okal said. ""But on the other side, we have to deal with the reality that we're in, and that this might drag longer than expected. ""Becky Sullivan reported from Jerusalem, Ruth Sherlock reported from Tel Aviv and Anas Baba reported from Gaza. ",npr_articles/article_315.txt,npr_results/article_315.txt.json

The streets of this once close-knit community are now lined with partially destroyed homes. Some were blown open, others burned. Inside one are blood-splattered walls. In another, two children's rooms are filled with books, binders, stuffed animals and paint supplies. The mattresses that lay in white bed frames are stained with blood. On the road leading into this kibbutz, a backhoe scoops up the bodies of Hamas militants who stormed this community of just over 1,000 people about three miles from the border with Gaza. The Israeli military has been leading journalists through this village in recent days to give the world a glimpse of what happened once Hamas militants crossed the border from Gaza into Israel undetected, storming several communities where they killed at least 1,400 people and took some 200 hostages. Many residents of the towns hid inside safe rooms waiting for Israeli forces to rescue them. For hours no one came. When it was finally over and they emerged, the scene was unlike anything they'd ever seen before. ""It was like an apocalypse,"" said Dan Alom, 23, who waited 15 hours before help arrived. ""Everything ruined, bodies lay around. ""More than a week since the Hamas attack, which set off a war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza where the group is based, survivors are still waiting to identify bodies and plan funerals""We're just still trying to figure out how we're going to deal with so many funerals,"" Alom told NPR's Morning Edition.  ""We don't know where to bury them because it's not safe. ""Over 100 people here were killed, some 10% of the community.  ""I just don't know how to deal with it,"" he said. ""For more than four or five hours we were slaughtered and no one came to help us. I don't know whose fault it is but I just know we've been slaughtered. ""Alom holds out hope that the two teens he counseled at camp might be alive. Maybe, he says, they're being held in Gaza. He wants them back. ""I am worried about them. And after they will be home, I don't care what happens with Gaza, I really don't,"" he said. ""Shoot them all. I don't care. ""It's a sentiment repeated among traumatized, grieving and frightened Israelis. Shoot them all. Eliminate Gaza. Erase Gaza. Their anger is not yet aimed so much at the government for its intelligence failure or Israeli forces for their delayed rescues, but toward the Palestinian enclave. Visible from Be'eri are plumes of smoke on the horizon rising from Gaza.  It's being crushed by a relentless wave of Israeli airstrikes, choked by a complete siege that's barred food, fuel, electricity and water from entering, and is bracing for Israel's ground invasion, all aimed at ridding the territory of Hamas. Over the weekend 34 aid trucks entered Gaza, the first humanitarian aid into the Palestinian enclave since the war began. Another 20 are expected today, according to Lynn Hastings, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In an interview with NPR's Morning Edition, Hastings stated that given the dire needs in Gaza, the deliveries are ""a drop in the bucket,"" adding that ""it's not nearly enough. ""The aid does not include fuel, meaning hospitals treating the thousands of wounded will soon collapse, desalination plants for water can't run and trucks distributing the aid won't be able to refuel. It is against this backdrop that more than 5,000 people in Gaza have been killed. Entire families and more than 1,600 children are gone. The devastation there is harder to recount because the borders are sealed and so few journalists are inside. Miles away from the border with Gaza, sitting in a Jerusalem café, 27-year-old Noy Katsman said they want the war to stop. They know Alom's pain but they say retribution won't bring their country safety. Katsman lost their brother, Hayim, 32, in the village of Holit about a mile from Gaza. Hayim was hiding in the closet when Hamas militants shot him and was one of 30 Americans killed in the attack. In life, Hayim was a peace activist. He wrote his doctorate on the dangers of the right wing in Israel and was critical of the government for encouraging illegal Israeli settlements and uplifting extreme anti-Arab voices. That's why Katsman believes their brother, despite his tragic killing, ""would say we should never kill innocent people"" and would encourage Israelis to re-think the long-term repercussions of retaliation. It's a view Katsman stands behind firmly, having seen Israel repeatedly try and fail in stamping out Hamas at the expense of civilian life. ""My government, instead of saying, 'OK, we failed, maybe we need to do something else,' they're saying, 'Oh, we need to kill more Palestinians. We need to now destroy Hamas,' "" said Katsman. ""It's right-wing politicians who gain power from violence and hate, these are the people who gain from it. But we lose from it. ""Violence brings more violence, they said. ""You need a basic understanding of how people feel,"" they added. ""And if after they kill us, a thousand people, we are going to kill 3,000 of them, that's not an understanding of people, because these people will grow up and hate us even more. "" As they speak, people at the café begin to stare. A waitress approaches to ask about the nature of Katsman's interview with NPR. ""Is it pro-Palestinian or pro-Israeli?"" she asks. ""It's pro-life,"" Katsman replied. ""My brother died on Saturday and he was a peace activist and I'm talking in his name. ""As the waitress walks away, Katsman slams their coffee cup onto the table. ""That's the problem – Israelis only care if something is pro-Palestinian or pro-Israel,"" they said. ""This question is a distraction. People die. People die from both sides.

317,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/20/1207543936/israel-palestine-hamas-west-bank,"QUSRA – Palestinians in the West Bank and inside Israel are wondering how much harder their lives may become as they watch the punishing Israeli airstrikes raining down on Gaza. There's a total siege of basic goods, hospitals are running out of fuel, people are running out of food and more than 5,000 Palestinians have been killed, over 1,600 of them children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Over the weekend 34 aid trucks entered Gaza from Egypt, the first humanitarian aid into the Palestinian enclave since the war began. Another 20 are expected today, according to Lynn Hastings, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory. But in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition, Hastings stated that given the staggering need in Gaza, the deliveries are ""a drop in the bucket"" and ""not nearly enough. "" The aid excludes fuel, meaning hospitals treating the thousands of wounded will soon collapse, desalination plants for water can't run and trucks distributing the aid won't be able to refuel. The Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres has said the Hamas attack – that killed 1,400 Israelis and saw Hamas take some 200 hostages – does not excuse this ""collective punishment. "" He has called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and demanded Hamas release the hostages. Two were released Friday. But the bloodshed is not contained in southern Israel and Gaza. Beyond the frontlines of this war between Israel and Hamas, Palestinians inside Israel and the occupied Palestinian West Bank say their lives and their lands are more in danger now than ever before. In the days following the Hamas attack, the worst killing of civilians in Israel's history, at least 74 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Many in settler violence according to witnesses and human rights groups. The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem has been documenting some of the attacks and sharing videos online. In one, an Israeli settler, accompanied by an Israeli soldier, shoots a man at point blank range. The worst of these attacks so far were in the Palestinian village of Qusra — where, at first, four people were killed. Then, when the villagers tried to mourn their dead in a funeral procession, witnesses said armed settlers lay in wait and shot and killed a father and son. It started last Tuesday when armed settlers from the neighboring settlement of Esh Kodesh came into this Palestinian village in the northern West Bank and attacked a house, witnesses said. A video shows masked armed men hurling rocks at the windows of the home on the edge of the village. A mother and her young children were inside alone. A call went out for the young men of the village to rush to the house and help. In a grove of trees they came under fire and three were killed. Later that day, witnesses in this village said, the Israeli military came into Qusra and shot another of their residents. Now, images of the dead are plastered everywhere. They're affixed to cars and on the walls of homes and offices. The backdrop of these posters are Palestinian flags and printed at the bottom of the posters are the words ""martyr"" and ""killed by the bullets of settlers. ""The Mayor of Qusra, Hani Awda Abu Alaa, said residents here are living in terror. ""The attacks on Qusra are ongoing and are on a daily basis,"" he told NPR's Morning Edition. He points to the walls of his office covered in pictures of violence by Israeli settlers. A damaged mosque. Burned down olive groves. A man killed. ""Wherever you look here, it's attacks by Israeli soldiers and settlers, the worst of which was the one we had a few days ago,"" he said. The mayor said even their funerals are not safe. He said he worked with Israeli authorities that control this area to make sure they could have safe passage on the road they'd use to mourn the first four men that were killed. But they found settlers and soldiers in their path, he said. ""It was a trap,"" he said. ""They had posted on their social media that we will take revenge. These people are violent all the time against the people of Qusra and the neighboring villages. But the war empowered them. ""Under the cover of the war in Gaza and rocket fire on Israel, there has been a significant increase in settler violence across the occupied West Bank against Palestinians, according to researcher Dror Etkes of the Israeli Human Rights Group B'Tselem, who has studied Israeli land policies around settlements for decades. ""The entire politics of this place is constructed on fear and racism, this is how this place is constructed,"" he said. Etkes added that though it is too early for exact figures on how much violence has increased, ""I don't think that I would be wrong if I would say that in the last week, we have seen increase of hundreds of percents. ""For these attacks, there appears to be no accountability. There've been no arrests in connection with the six killings in Qusra, according to the Israeli police. The incidents are under investigation. That seems to be the case for all the attacks since the war began. A lawyer who represents settlers accused of violence told NPR that there have been many shootings of Israelis since Oct. 7th and not one arrest. In response to a query to the Israeli military on whether one of their soldiers killed a Palestinian in Qusra, the military said it was checking but didn't respond with further information. Meanwhile, in Qusra they mourn. At the gathering hall in the center of the village, women come to pay their respects to the family members of the dead. They sit side-by-side on couches, pillows and plastic chairs, crying as they pass around and kiss posters of the men who were killed. Hassan Mohanned Abu Sarour was among the young men who heeded the call to help when the armed settlers attacked. The 21-year-old was shot. His mother sits quietly in the hall, her aunt and cousin drape their arms around her protectively. She can't speak in the midst of her grief, so her cousin Hanan Awda speaks on her behalf. ""He was helping his father to save money in order to build a small house,"" she said. ""He was a polite kid. ""The goal of this violence she said is to make it untenable for Palestinians to stay on their land. That depopulation has already happened in other places. In at least two villages, Al-Qanub and Wadi Al-Sik, there are no Palestinians left because of violence by Israeli settlers. ""They want to evacuate us from our own lands. They say these lands are ours, not yours,"" Awda said. The settlements are illegal, with the U. N. Security Council saying they violate international law. They're also a detriment to any future peace. The Oslo Accords in the 1990s raised expectations among Palestinians that the West Bank along with Jerusalem would be part of their future state. Today, though, Israel maintains authority in the West Bank. The road from Jerusalem to Qusra shows how far beyond reach a two-state solution seems to be. Palestinian villages dot the horizon alongside Israeli settlements that are rapidly expanding. Billboards are erected on the main highway advertising real estate projects for new and cheaper housing for Israelis. The settlement expansion has been encouraged by the Israeli government. The recent surge in violence amid the growth of settlements has dimmed Mayor Abu Ala's sense of hope. ""I see the future as a bleak future. I see it as a black future,"" he said, adding that ""we are not against the Jews. We are against the extremism of the settlers encouraged by government officials. ""At the limits of Abu Alaa's village he points to empty land. A local businessman who planned to erect a building has abandoned the project. The farmers who tended chickens here are also gone, afraid of settler violence. He points to the hilltop across the way, to three settlements and an Israeli military outpost. There, he said, is where settlers come from to attack them. ""Their intention is to separate us from the villages and cities in the West Bank,"" Abu Alaa said. ""They've cut us off from the south, they've cut us off from Ramallah. ""Nearby the young men of Qusra have tried to block the road with stones to stop would-be attackers. For the mayor, that separation and the pressure to abandon these lands echo what's unfolded in Gaza –- where Palestinians have lived under a 16-year blockade implemented by Israel and Egypt. ""These people in Gaza have been under siege for so long and have been killed in such a way, this is why the war took place,"" Abu Alaa said. ""If our situation continues here with settler attacks, the same thing will happen. People will start feeling the same way as Gaza. ""It's not something he wants or agrees with. ""The more aggressiveness on the one side, the more the aggressiveness from the other side,"" he said. ""I address the Israeli people and say enough killings on both sides. ""NPR's Ari Shapiro met with a settler from the neighboring settlement of Esh Kodesh, which is where the villagers of Qusra say the attackers came from. With an M16 hanging at his waist and a Glock on him, Nati Romhas lived in the area since the late 90s and said he helped establish a few of the new Israeli settlements in the area. Rom believes life in the occupied West Bank is a battle and hopes other Israelis are coming around to his view. ""Unfortunately, in the last years, because of the propaganda and progressive things, like, disarm, so many of the villagers were disarmed,"" he told Shapiro. ""Now we are working very hard to solve this and to give guns to the people, to civilian groups. ""The future Rom aspires to is one that doesn't include Palestinians. ""The future is that we will be able to eliminate the snake,"" Rom said. ""They all want to kill us, some of them telling it straight away, and some of them keep it to themselves. ""Rom denies that settlers from Esh Kodesh fatally shot any villagers in Qusra. Asked if there are any good people in the village, Rom said, if so, they need to immediately evacuate. Though Nati is more militant than other settlers, the most violent wing of the settler community is ""not a small group,"" said Etkes. And many across the spectrum do see their presence in the occupied West Bank as part of an existential struggle. In a settlement called Eli at the top of a hill surrounded by olive groves, husband and wife Gedaliah and Elisheva Blum are convinced Israelis and Palestinians are locked in a battle that proves they cannot live side-by-side. ""I don't think it's a battle over land. I think it's a battle over culture. It's a battle over ideologies,"" said Gedaliah, who wonders ""at what point do we say we can't live with these people?""But Gedaliah is certain of one thing. There's no going back to the way things were. ""The way I see it is that the lion has been sleeping,"" she said, referring to Israel. ""It's just gotten woken up.

318,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/20/1207523642/yemen-missiles-intercepted,"The Pentagon said it shot down missiles fired from Yemen and potentially headed towards Israel. The report came just a day after U. S. troops were attacked in Iraq and Syria, stoking fears of a regional expansion of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. The USS Carney, which is currently stationed in the Northern Red Sea, successfully intercepted three cruise missiles and several drones that had been launched by Houthi forces in Yemen, according to Air Force Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon's press secretary. No one was injured in the incident. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Ryder said the Pentagon was still working to determine the weapons' intended target, but told reporters they were heading north and ""potentially towards targets in Israel. "" Defense analysts and military officials believe the Houthis have medium-range ballistic missiles capable of reaching Israel, more than 1,300 miles away. The Carney is equipped with various missile defense systems, though the Pentagon hasn't said which system was used to destroy the missiles. The incident could represent the first shots taken by the U. S. military in defense of Israel since the country was attacked by the Palestinian militant group on Oct. 7.  With regional tensions continuing to rise, the U. S. has been on high alert for activity from Iranian proxy groups like the Houthis. Several armed groups aligned with Iran have vowed to target U. S. military bases in the Middle East if it intervened in an expected Israeli ground invasion of Gaza. The Carney's defense actions came just a day after three separate drone attacks targeted U. S. air bases in Iraq and Syria. Two of the attacks caused ""minor injuries"" to coalition forces, Ryder told the press on Thursday. During the third, at Al Assad air base in western Iraq, an American contractor had a cardiac episode and died. Ryder characterized the incidents as a clear ""uptick"" in drone activity against the U. S. , but said the Pentagon was still working to determine whether the incidents were connected to Iran-backed groups. It's unclear if the U. S. will retaliate. ""It's our aim to avoid any regional expansion of Israel's conflict with Hamas,"" Ryder said. ""But we stand ready and prepared to defend our partners and our interests, and we will act to do so. "" He added that the Pentagon did not take the series of attacks on U. S. bases as a reason to believe the Israel-Hamas conflict had grown to include additional Iran allies.  Iran has long provided support for Hamas in the form of training and ammunition, but the U. S. has said there's no clear evidence that Iran was directly involved in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. President Biden has repeatedly warned Iran and its regional allies not to escalate tensions by getting involved. He's strengthened U. S. posture in the region by deploying several warships, aircraft carriers and marines to the area, but also made clear that he does not intend for the U. S. to become directly involved militarily.

319,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/20/1207526804/mother-daughter-american-hostages-released-israel-hamas,"JERUSALEM — Two American hostages who were captured by the militant group Hamas during its attack on Israel this month have been released, the Israeli prime minister's office announced Friday. Judith Raanan, 59, and Natalie Raanan, 17, a mother and daughter from Illinois, had been visiting family in Israel when they were abducted by Hamas on Oct. 7, according to news interviews given by family members. ""Our fellow citizens have endured a terrible ordeal these past 14 days, and I am overjoyed that they will soon be reunited with their family, who has been wracked with fear,"" said President Biden in a statement. The two spoke by phone with Biden in a video released by the White House on Saturday, where they said they are in good health. The elder Raanan, also known by her Hebrew name, Yehudit, is an operating room nurse. Her daughter recently graduated from high school and was taking a gap year to travel, according to Saray Cohen, Raanan's sister, who spoke with the Israeli public broadcaster Kan. The pair's exit from Gaza was facilitated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the two were received by the Israeli military at the border of the Gaza Strip, according to the prime minister's office. ""At the moment, they are on their way to a meeting point at a military base in the center of their country, where their family members are waiting for them,"" the statement said. Speaking to reporters from the State Department, U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed that two Americans are with Israeli authorities in Israel and that a team from the U. S. Embassy would meet with them soon. Blinken added that he did not yet have details about the conditions of the mother and daughter. ""Over the coming hours, they'll receive any support and assistance they need, and of course, we are very anxious to be able to reunite them with their loved ones,"" Blinken said.  The mother and daughter had traveled to Israel together to celebrate Judith Raanan's mother's 85th birthday, Cohen said in the Kan video, which was posted earlier Friday. ""We have no idea whatsoever what is their situation, where they're being held. We just want them to come back to us,"" she added. The Raanans were staying in a guesthouse in southern Israel on Oct. 7 when Hamas militants flooded across the Gaza border and into Israeli communities nearby. More than 1,400 people died in the attack, including hundreds of people killed in their homes and at a music festival, Israeli officials say. Among the towns attacked was Nahal Oz, a quiet, small kibbutz just half a mile from the border with Gaza. Family members had been in contact with the Raanans, who were in Nahal Oz, even as the fighting began that morning, according to Cohen. For hours, they received updates via WhatsApp from the two, who were hiding in a safe room, according to relatives. But the messages stopped soon after noon, Cohen said. ""After two hours or so of silence, we started to feel uneasy. ""The agreement to release the Raanans was the result of negotiations among the U. S. , Israel, Qatar and Hamas. About 200 hostages are thought to remain in the hands of Hamas, including dozens of children, according to the Israeli military. Ten Americans also remain unaccounted for, according to Blinken.  ""We have not ceased our efforts to secure the release of those who are still being held,"" Biden said. Israeli leaders have said that until all hostages are released, Israel will not lift a siege of Gaza that has cut off food, water, electricity and fuel from the territory that is home to more than 2 million Palestinians. In a statement, Hamas said it would continue to work with mediators, such as Qatar and Egypt, to release all civilians under what it called ""appropriate security conditions. """"The news that Judith and Natalie have been released gives us overwhelming gratitude to God that our prayers are being heard,"" Rabbi Meir Hecht of Chabad of Evanston, who is close to the family, told NPR. ""At the same time, we're so deeply concerned for the 200-plus other hostages that are still in the hands of Hamas terrorists, and we continue to pray, and ask everyone to pray, for their immediate release,"" he said.

320,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/20/1206301577/biden-ukraine-israel-congress-funding-request,"President Biden has asked lawmakers for almost $106 billion in funding for Israel, Ukraine, countering China in the Indo-Pacific, and operations on the southern U. S. border. The fate of the request rests in the hands of Congress, where many Republicans in the House of Representatives want to rein in government spending, particularly on support for Ukraine. Here's how the request breaks down. Biden has pledged to back Ukraine ""as long as it takes"" in its fight against Russia, now into its 20th month with no end in sight. Congress approved more than $112 billion in aid for Ukraine in 2022, but the White House has said that money has almost run out. Earlier this fall, Biden asked for $24 billion to get Ukraine through December, with most of the money going to military aid. This new request is designed to last through September 2024. It includes weapons, equipment, support for U. S. troops in Europe and economic support for Ukraine's government. In Tel Aviv, Biden promised an ""unprecedented"" package of aid to support Israel after the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7. The request includes funding for air and missile defense, military financing and embassy support. This includes support for Israel, Gaza and Ukraine. The breakdown of this funding is ""flexible,"" White House budget director Shalanda Young told reporters, depending on where the need is greatest. This will provide support to ""multiple countries"" in the region, national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters. A breakdown was not immediately available. Senate Republicans — including Leader Mitch McConnell — have said they want to make sure Taiwan, a self-governing island that China claims as its own territory, can deter Beijing from attacking. Materials provided to reporters did not specifically mention Taiwan. The request includes money for U. S. shipyards that build attack submarines, and $2 billion for the World Bank to provide alternatives to China's Belt and Road lending to developing countries. Earlier this year, the White House asked for but did not receive $4 billion to help deal with fentanyl trafficking and provide help to migrants at the southern U. S. border. This new request is broader and includes money for detention facilities, border agents, asylum officers and state and local governments struggling to provide services to migrants.",npr_articles/article_320.txt,npr_results/article_320.txt.json
321,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/20/1206157206/israel-hamas-war-crimes-international-law-geneva-convention,"The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has led to accusations of war crimes on both sides, after Israeli civilians were targeted in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack and Israel responded with airstrikes on the densely populated Gaza Strip. Under these conditions, protecting civilians can prove difficult or impossible. But combatants are bound by international humanitarian law to minimize the impact on populations. Here's what to know. Although the history of international law regulating warfare goes back to the first Geneva Convention of 1864, World War II — in which twice as many civilians as fighters were among the tens of millions killed and the Nuremberg Trials that held Nazi leaders to account for atrocities — spawned interest in expanding the scope of the agreement. The 1949 Geneva Convention established Article 3, delineated combatants from noncombatants and set down the obligations of governments and militaries on how to minimize casualties and the suffering of civilians in wartime. International humanitarian law ""basically grounds the parties to a conflict,"" says Fernando Travesí, executive director of the New York-based International Center for Transitional Justice, which works with victims of massive human rights violations. Armies, he says, have the right to go to war, ""but that exercise of violence has limits. ""The Geneva Convention has been agreed to by 196 states and serves as the international standard on the treatment of civilians, as well as prisoners of war and sick and wounded soldiers. In a practical sense, every government in the world subscribes to these rules, says Kenneth Roth, a visiting professor at Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs and former executive director of Human Rights Watch. ""I think it's important to stress that these [rules] are not the concoctions of human rights groups. These are not idealistic, pacifist rules. These are the rules that the militaries themselves adopted for themselves,"" he says. A violation of protections under the Geneva Convention, such as the prohibition against deliberately targeting civilians, opens up leaders and common soldiers alike to prosecution. Such prosecutions could be handled by an international court or tribunal, or any nation exercising ""universal jurisdiction"" — a principle that allows any country's courts to prosecute war crimes. Universal doctrine applies equally to Israel and Hamas, the militant group that governs the Gaza Strip, as well as Islamic Jihad, a small extremist group that has also carried out attacks against Israel. Israel, like the United States and Russia, is not among the 123 states that are party to the Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands. The Palestinians, however, joined in 2015, so the ICC has jurisdiction over the West Bank and Gaza Strip. ""That means that any Palestinian national can be prosecuted,"" Roth says. And, he adds, it also means that any Israeli war crime committed inside Palestinian territory can also be prosecuted. A United Nations-established body known as the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem and Israel, says it has begun ""collecting and preserving evidence of war crimes committed by all sides"" since the start of the conflict following the Hamas attacks. On Friday, Amnesty International said it had documented evidence that Israeli forces were failing to discriminate between military targets and civilians. It also called on Hamas to release civilian hostages and immediately end indiscriminate rocket fire. Civilians inevitably get caught between warring parties, but the norms of international humanitarian law require that ""you never target civilians, you never indiscriminately fire on a civilian area, you never launch an attack that will have a disproportionate impact on the civilian population,"" according to Roth. ""Premeditated, planned and deliberate killing of civilians — that's a clear war crime,"" the ICTJ's Travesí says. By that definition, he says, the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that targeted Israeli civilians, killing some 1,400, clearly fits within the definition of a war crime. Hamas militants took about 200 others hostage — an act also explicitly prohibited by the Geneva Convention. Despite Hamas being an irregular force, it is subject to the same international humanitarian law as Israel Defense Forces soldiers, says Oona Hathaway, a Yale Law School professor and founder and director of the school's Center for Global Legal Challenges. ""International humanitarian law applies not just in conflicts between states . . . between . . . a modern sovereign state and another sovereign state, but also between states and nonstate actors,"" she says. ""So here we've got a conflict between Hamas, which is a nonstate actor group, and a state that is Israel. ""And Hamas' attacks, brutal killings and kidnapping of Israelis, clearly constitute war crimes, says Hathaway, coauthor of The Internationalists: How a Radical Plan to Outlaw War Remade the World. Civilians often find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time — near, for example, what is presumed by combatants to be a legitimate military target. Those cases can be a gray area for military decision-makers and in international humanitarian law, where the principle of proportionality applies. An attack would not be proportional ""if the civilian injury, civilian death or damage to civilian objects expected from such an attack would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated from that attack,"" explains Tom Dannenbaum, associate professor of international law at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. ""That's obviously a complicated process and is often subject to debates about exactly when that line is crossed,"" he says. The densely populated Gaza Strip presents ""a huge challenge"" for the Israeli military, Travesí acknowledges. Fighting an irregular force such as Hamas, whose fighters operate in urban areas and don't wear uniforms, makes that challenge even more difficult, says Roth. ""It can be difficult for the attacker to distinguish between a combatant and a noncombatant. But that difficulty does not absolve the attacking party from the duty always to distinguish between combatants who can be targeted and noncombatants who cannot be,"" Roth says. In recent days, Israel Defense Forces told Gazans to evacuate the north of the territory during an apparent ramped-up bombardment in retaliation for Hamas' attack on Israel, and in anticipation of an expected ground assault. That could be seen as a humanitarian gesture, ""but it has been done in a wholly inhumane way, because to order 1. 1 million people to evacuate in the course of a few hours is obviously impossible,"" Roth says. ""It's cruel, [and] it creates panic. ""Preventing or withholding medical supplies and medical care for civilian population ""could amount to a war crime as well, because that could amount to a collective punishment,"" which is also a violation of the Geneva Convention, according to Travesí. And simply warning the population to leave to avoid further harm does not allow a military force to wash its hands of responsibility, Dannenbaum notes. ""Whether or not individuals comply with that warning does not change their status,"" he says. ""So if they don't move, if they remain in that location, their civilian status endures and has precisely the same weight in the context of proportionality as it would have absent the warning. ""Simply gathering evidence of war crimes can be extremely difficult amid the fog of war, Travesí says. ""That's why many, many human rights activists and many journalists, they collect a lot of documentation and evidence that might be very, very important for the future or accountability processes,"" he says. Suspects can be brought before the International Criminal Court at The Hague or ad hoc tribunals, or at the national level, something that the ICC encourages, Dannenbaum says. ""It defers to genuine national prosecutorial efforts. In this way, it's different from the former Yugoslav and Rwanda tribunals, which had primary jurisdiction. So the International Criminal Court actually encourages national governments to prosecute their own offenders. ""In 1961, Israel itself, for example, famously exercised universal jurisdiction to try Nazi officer Adolf Eichmann for his role in the Holocaust and war crimes committed during World War II. That trial was broadcast around the world. However, justice at the international level can be slow, complex — and frequently unsatisfying. ""In any conflict in the world, you can't have the expectation that you will prosecute everybody,"" Travesí says. ""So, you have to choose some. You have to do some selection and prioritization of cases. ""In other words, top leaders may be held accountable for war crimes, while rank-and-file soldiers are able to evade justice. When it comes to bringing prosecutions of war crimes, ""The ICC has not had a high success rate,"" Dannenbaum acknowledges. Even so, an international arrest warrant could be executed by any of the 123 ICC member nations. Indeed, they would be required to do so. The accused, Dannenbaum says, ""would take a significant risk in traveling"" to any member state. ""That's the reason that [Russian President] Vladimir Putin did not travel to South Africa for the BRICS summit this summer,"" he says, referring to the international meeting of emerging economies that took place in Johannesburg in August. ""South Africa would have had an obligation to arrest him, because there was an arrest warrant from the ICC — and South Africa is an ICC state party.

322,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/20/1207370235/israel-rafah-border-crossing-gaza-humanitarian-aid,"With truckloads of aid waiting on one side and over 2 million Palestinians facing shortages of food, water and medicine on the other, all eyes Friday were watching the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza to see if a deal to deliver relief would hold. After the White House announced the deal earlier this week to allow 20 trucks of aid into Gaza, negotiations over the logistics of the delivery remain ongoing — in part to address Israel's concerns about how to keep the aid out of the hands of Hamas, the Gaza-based militant group whose deadly surprise attack on Israel earlier this month sparked the current hostilities. President Biden said on Friday that he believes the first 20 trucks carrying humanitarian aid shipments for Gaza will be able to pass through Egypt's Rafah crossing in the next 24 to 48 hours.  Biden said roads will still need to be repaved for the supplies to cross through. ""I got a commitment from the Israelis and the president of Egypt that the crossing will be opened,"" Biden told reporters at the White House, while a United Nations spokesperson told Reuters on Friday that a first aid delivery was due to start ""in the next day or so. "" Biden's comments came as the White House asked Congress for more than $105 billion in a foreign aid. The request includes more than $14 billion for Israel and more than $9 billion for humanitarian aid for Israel, Gaza, Ukraine and other conflicts. For now, however, it remains unclear how far the funding package will go in Congress given that the Republican-led House of Representatives remains without a speaker. Separately on Friday, the the Israeli prime minister's office announced two Americans taken hostage by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attack have been released. In a statement, President Biden said he was ""overjoyed"" by the release of Judith Raanan, 59, and Natalie Raanan, 17, a mother and daughter from Illinois who had been visiting family in Israel. Biden said his administration will continue efforts to free others abducted by Hamas. The political stalemate in the House is further complicating the effort to deliver essential supplies to Gaza — where over 2 million Palestinians face shortages of food, water and medicine. Gaza residents are facing an increasingly acute humanitarian crisis. The territory's main power plant, desalination plants and wastewater facilities have all been unable to operate for days, the U. N. reports. Near-constant Israeli airstrikes have also destroyed thousands of homes, Palestinian officials say. The death toll from Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip is now at least 4,137, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, which says the figure includes 1,661 children. There are some 13,000 wounded. Meanwhile, the number of causalities from the Hamas attack on Israel remains at more than 1,400 and the Israeli military says about 200 hostages are being held in Gaza, including more than 20 who are under the age of 18 and some 10 or 20 over the age of 60. Israeli airstrikes continue as conditions deteriorate in Gaza. On Thursday night, a Greek Orthodox church compound was hit. Hundreds of displaced Palestinians were sheltering in place when Saint Porphyrius was hit, according to Gaza's Interior Ministry. At least 16 Palestinians were killed in the strike, Reuters reported. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem called the violence against churches and safe havens a ""war crime that cannot be ignored. ""The Israel Defense Forces said it was looking into the incident. On Thursday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told troops to be prepared to see ""Gaza from the inside"" — the latest sign that a ground invasion is imminent. Israel also began evacuating a town near the northern border with Lebanon, as cross-border attacks from Hezbollah continues. Gaza has been under total blockade by Israel since the days after the Oct. 7 attacks. Israeli officials say the siege is necessary to stamp out Hamas, which governs Gaza — and they will not allow in aid via Israel's border crossings until Hamas releases approximately 200 hostages captured during the attack. On a brief trip to Israel this week, President Biden had worked to convince Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to allow in aid. Both countries have expressed concerns: Israel sought assurances that Hamas would not divert aid or use the trucks to smuggle in weapons, asking that U. N. workers inspect trucks before they entered Gaza. Egypt has said it will refuse the mass displacement of Palestinian refugees across its border. As of Friday, a total of about 200 trucks are waiting on the Egyptian side of the border, according to the U. N. , with yet more aid stockpiled in the Egyptian city of El-Arish, about 30 miles from the Gaza border. Earlier on Friday, U. N. Secretary-General António Guterres, who arrived at the Egyptian side of the border crossing, described the aid as ""the difference between life and death"" for people in Gaza and urged inspections to be loosened. ""Those verifications need to be done in a way that is practical and in a way that is expedited,"" Guterres said. Among those desperately awaiting word of the border's status were the hundreds of U. S. citizens who have been trapped in Gaza since the outbreak of the war. One of them, Wafaa Abuzayda, who lives in Massachusetts, was visiting family in Gaza when the war began earlier this month. Like many people in Gaza, Abuzayda, along with her husband and 1-year-old son Yousef, moved south toward Rafah after Israel urged people to evacuate from the northern half of Gaza. But that hasn't been safe, she said. Israeli airstrikes have continued to hit southern Gaza. On Thursday night, a building nearby was struck, causing a window to shatter as her son was sleeping nearby, she said. ""I pulled him immediately, and I hugged him. He was freaking out. He was looking at me — he doesn't know what is going on,"" she said. ""We are not safe here. "" There has been no indication if U. S. citizens would be allowed out if the Rafah crossing opens to allow in aid. In the occupied West Bank, tensions grew overnight after a confrontation between Israeli forces and Palestinians at a refugee camp in Nur Shams, northeast of Tel Aviv near the territory's border with Israel. An Israeli airstrike and an exchange of fire between Israeli police and Palestinians followed an Israeli search-and-arrest operation in the camp, the United Nations said. The IDF said ""a number of terrorists"" were killed in counterterrorism operations; Palestinian health officials reported at least 11 deaths. Israeli media report the death of one Israeli policeman. In total, at least 80 people in the West Bank have been killed by Israeli forces since the start of the war earlier this month, according to Palestinian officials.

323,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/20/1207042002/israel-gaza-hamas-etgar-karet-writer,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Sometimes fiction can help us see the world more clearly than the news can. And since the war started, I've been thinking about the fiction writer Etgar Keret. He's a beloved Israeli author of short stories and other writings. His work can be absurd, fantastical and poetic. I got to visit him at the apartment in a leafy neighborhood of Tel Aviv where he lives with his wife and a white rabbit named Hanzo. ""He's a protection rabbit,"" Keret jokingly tells me. ""He's always alert. And, you know, he's like a Rottweiler. ""When I interviewed him in 2019, Keret told me fiction helps him make sense of a crazy world. And now the world seems even crazier. So I asked what fiction is doing for him today. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Etgar Keret: So I started writing during my compulsory army service, being one of the worst soldiers in the history of the IDF, and basically having my best friend die in my arms, you know? So I got into writing, really, out of despair, it was kind of like the last option, you know? And I think ever since then there is something about writing that it functions like an airbag in a car, you know? COVID, a terrorist attack, my girlfriend dumped me — I run to the computer and I write something. And it's as if, like, it's both something that protects me from reality, and at the same time can create the bridge to reality, and also makes me understand myself. So I really don't remember any time in my life that it was bad that I didn't write. But this time, it was as if there was nothing to write because, I guess, for writing you need to have a bit of a solid ground, this kind of feeling — you should know up from down, you should know what your name is — if you don't hold that, you cannot do anything. Ari Shapiro [voiceover]: Etgar Keret told me he's been doing something that might sound strange: He and his wife drive to places where survivors of the massacre gather. Maybe, he says, it's a reading or they do yoga. But really, it's just a place to be together. Kind of like an AA meeting, he said. And sometimes he taps little things out on his iPhone's Notes app. It's not the kind of writing he's used to, but it's what he's doing now. Keret: And the weird thing is that I made these friends through these two weeks. And it's not ""friends"" — we're kind of, I don't know, we're survivors running for cover together. But I've been building this little group of people who like my stories and who seem to be sensitive and lost. And I send them stories every couple of days. Shapiro: Will you show me?Keret: I have them in English:It's just things that happen. I just tried to capture them, you know?Shapiro: I don't know what I expected when I came to talk to you, but I think I imagined some sort of omniscient fiction writer. And what I hear from you is that you are as lost in a fog searching for your way as anyone. Keret: For sure. I'll tell you one story, OK? So, one morning I'm getting a WhatsApp from a guy I don't know. He's an officer about to go to Gaza. And he says, ""I don't know you, but I need your help with something. This is the contact info of my ex-girlfriend. She dumped me. And I just want to ask you that if I die, you will contact her and say to her, I'm sorry for everything. And that I went to this war thinking about her. "" And I kind of say to him, ""Look, I don't know you. ""Shapiro: Why would he give you that message? Keret: I said, ""I don't know you. I don't know her. I don't know. Ask your family, your friends. "" And he says, ""She's very angry with me and I'm not sure if she will listen to any of them, but you are her favorite author. So if you call her, she'll listen to you. ""So, of course, immediately I call up the girl. I said to her, ""Listen, I have a lot on my head. I'm not gonna go get your ex-boyfriend's name every day just to see if he died, you know? I have other things to deal with. So I'm telling you what he said, do with it what you want, you know. If you want to say something to him before he dies, go ahead. "" And I get a WhatsApp back, much more relaxed than my WhatsApp, and she said, ""Would you like to know why I dumped in?"" And I said, ""Yes. "" And then she told me, ""Maybe I shouldn't share that, you know?"" But immediately I say, Oh, my God, you know, I don't like this guy so much anymore. And me and this girl, we're kind of friends now. And I send her stories, like, every couple of days. Shapiro: In this moment, I know that people all over the country are sending clothes and food and basic supplies. What's the good of sending stories?Keret: You know, first of all, I said to my wife, I wish I was good at other things too. You know, I'm a bad driver. I can't cook. I don't know how to do many things. But I think in war, you can be confused only in stories. If you try to be confused on Facebook, you know, they're going to tear you to pieces. This is an atmosphere where if somebody wants to say something positive, general and naïve, everybody will attack him. If you want to say something that is negative, shallow and extreme, everybody says, ""OK, this is an argument. "" If I say, ""How about we blow up the entire region?"" Then people say, ""OK, we'll talk about that. "" But if I say, you know, ""I think it's sad when I see any human being dying,"" then they say, ""Oh my God, here he goes again. ""So I'm saying at least art allows you to do that. Because it's so irrelevant and unimportant. It's almost like the attic — it's the hiding place for your emotions during war, you know, go and put them there. Go read a story. Go read a poem. Go write a poem. Because if you try to interact with people and bring your complexity, they're going to rip you to pieces.

324,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/19/1205700419/israel-us-ambassador-senate-middle-east,"With Israel at war with Hamas, the Senate is moving urgently to fill key U. S. diplomatic posts throughout the Middle East — many of which have been sitting empty for months. Most glaringly, the U. S. does not currently have an ambassador in Israel. That vacancy hobbles the Biden administration's ability to pursue a number of goals, from negotiating the release of U. S. hostages held by Hamas to easing the violence and preventing it from blossoming into a wider conflict. It is ""unprecedented"" to have so many U. S. ambassador posts sit vacant for as long as they have this year, Farah Pandith, an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told NPR. ""We're in the midst of an extremely dangerous moment in the Middle East and the value of having a U. S. ambassador on the ground in Israel can't be overstated,"" Pandith said. ""It is critical in both the short term and over the longer term. ""It's the second recent war to break out in a country without a U. S. ambassador. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the top U. S. diplomatic post was also empty. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing for Jack Lew, President Biden's nominee to the Israel post, on Wednesday — just one month after Lew was nominated. It's expected to hold a vote next week. If approved, Lew's nomination heads to the full Senate for confirmation. Lew was Treasury Secretary under President Barack Obama. He has also held numerous White House jobs and is a former director of the Office of Management and Budget. But Republicans on the panel criticized Lew, because he worked on the controversial Iran nuclear deal in 2015. Lew, who is Jewish, told the panel he sees Iran as an ""evil, malign government"" and a threat to Israel. Lew's relatively rapid advance is paralleled elsewhere. This week, the Senate also confirmed new ambassadors to Kuwait and Oman, and the foreign relations panel is holding a hearing for Biden's pick to represent the U. S. in Egypt. Some important ambassadorial posts in the region, such as in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, were filled earlier in 2023 after sitting empty for nearly a year. Even before the shocking Hamas attack on Oct. 7, U. S. diplomatic corps in Israel were very busy. The U. S had two main goals: trying to convince Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to temper his plans to weaken the judiciary; and reaching an agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia to normalize relations. ""We have diplomats for a reason,"" Pandith said. She later added, ""American foreign policy starts in Washington, but the leadership on the ground helps to see it through. ""Before Hamas militants launched their surprise attack, at least five U. S. ambassador posts were sitting vacant in the Arabic world, according to the American Foreign Service Association. ""Many of these countries are key regional actors who could be leveraged to advance U. S. interests in resolving the current round of fighting,"" Pandith said. ""For example, Egypt shares a border with Gaza and Oman is a trusted intermediary between the United States and Iran. ""Vacant ambassador posts do more than limit a country's ability to pursue strategic and foreign policy goals; the empty posts also send a message. ""We are promoting the view that what is happening there is not important to us,"" and the U. S. doesn't have interests in the Middle East, Pandith said. ""The irony is that China has also taken to filling the diplomatic void we've left in the region,"" she said, ""the most notable example being this spring when it brokered an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, notorious historical foes. ""Most of the delays have nothing to do with the candidates, many of whom are career diplomats. Senators can place a block on their nominations to gain leverage for their own political aims — such as when Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. , blocked all State Department nominees earlier this year in his fight for records related to the origins of COVID-19.  When Paul lifted his block in July, the Senate confirmed 15 ambassadors in one day. Such delays are a sign of how the confirmation process has become increasingly politicized. Four years ago, the U. S. diplomatic corps also had dozens of vacancies — but nearly all of the longest-delayed nominations were for political appointees, not career diplomats. As of this week, 13 nominations from 2022 are still pending, and nearly all of them are for career diplomats.",npr_articles/article_324.txt,npr_results/article_324.txt.json
325,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/19/1207173798/fake-accounts-old-videos-and-rumors-fuel-chaos-around-gaza-hospital-explosion,"Journalists and researchers are still piecing together a full picture of what caused a massive explosion at the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza on Tuesday. The blast killed hundreds of people, many of whom were reportedly sheltering from bombardment elsewhere. Almost immediately, claims and counterclaims flew about who was responsible. Many initial news stories reported it as an Israeli airstrike, citing the Palestinian health ministry. Israel denied the accusation and said it was caused by a misfired rocket launched by a Palestinian militant group. On Wednesday, the U. S. backed up Israel's claim, based on its own analysis of ""overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information. ""As more evidence has emerged, including photos of the blast site and videos from the time of the explosion, the majority of independent analysts say the damage is not consistent with a standard Israeli airstrike. But in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, the shifting accounts in news outlets and the rapid spread on social media of unverified information, old videos and bogus eyewitness accounts fueled speculation, suspicion and outrage — and, experts say, are making it more difficult to establish accountability for the tragedy. Even before evidence was available and fully assessed, many people had already made up their minds about whether Israel or Palestinians were to blame for the carnage. Protests broke out across the Middle East and a planned summit between President Biden and Palestinian, Egyptian and Jordanian leaders was canceled. ""There really so far does appear to be a flood of misinformation in a very short time, and in a way that's having a material impact on the diplomacy around the conflict, on the mass mobilization and protests, some of which have the ability to lead to violence,"" said Daniel Silverman, a political science professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies war and misinformation. ""It's hard to argue misinformation isn't a central story here, and a really consequential one. ""Soon after news of the explosion broke, videos began circulating online — but some did not actually show the incident. Israel's official account on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, posted a video it said showed the explosion was caused by a Palestinian rocket — but the post was edited to remove the video after a New York Times journalist noted its timestamp was well after the blast. Another much-viewed video claiming to show the hospital blast was first posted in 2022, in what's become a common tactic of recycling and misrepresenting conflict footage. Amid the chaos, some social media accounts seized the opportunity to push their own narratives and gain followings. ""In the time between something happening and us having a really good assessment of what happened, there are a lot of people who will seek to use this situation — if they can make you believe something about it — that is absolutely to their benefit,"" said E. Rosalie Li, a researcher and founder of the Information Epidemiology Lab. That has been particularly pronounced on X, where owner Elon Musk has made changes that have made it harder to identify credible sources and that favor engaging posts regardless of whether they are accurate. On Tuesday, an X account purporting to be a journalist at Al Jazeera claimed to have seen eyewitness evidence that the hospital was hit by a Hamas rocket. Al Jazeera disavowed the account, saying it had no journalist by that name. A quick perusal of the account's posts showed that until very recently it had been posting about Indian politics and trolling Pakistan's cricket team. The account was eventually taken down, but not before it rapidly gained followers and was shared by other large accounts, including by a conservative national security group in the U. S. (X responded to a request for comment with an email auto-reply saying ""Busy now, please check back later. "")Many of the unverified or bogus claims about the hospital explosion, as well as other misleading narratives about the Israel-Hamas war, are being made and amplified by X accounts carrying checkmarks. Those used to signal an account was who it said it was, but under Musk, anyone can pay an $8 monthly subscription fee to get one. Accounts with the checkmarks are boosted on the platform and are eligible to earn advertising money if their posts get enough views. Critics say the arrangement incentivizes posting regardless of truth and, at worst, enables bad actors to monetize false information. ""The way that the platform has been shifted just rewards, encourages, incentivizes and amplifies the bulls***,"" said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. One post from a checkmarked account contained a screenshot of a fake Facebook page appearing to show Israel's military claiming credit for the attack. It received more than a million views. The post has since been deleted, but many others using the same language and the same screenshot remain on X. According to NewsGuard, a company that rates the reliability of online news sources, nearly three-quarters of the 250 most-engaged posts on X promoting false or unsubstantiated narratives about the conflict were made by accounts carrying subscription checkmarks. Other changes under Musk, including no longer displaying headlines on links posted to X, as well as the exodus of many users including journalists, experts and some media outlets (including NPR), are also making it harder to vet much of the information on the platform. Kolina Koltai, of the open source investigations group Bellingcat, is among the researchers sifting through video and images for clues about what caused the hospital explosion. She and her colleagues have been cautious about making any declarative statements before they have a fuller understanding. She emphasizes that this work takes time and patience. ""We want answers right away. And sometimes we don't have answers right away,"" she said. ""In times like this, where you can't take the slow, methodical work that usually [open-source investigation] requires, it could have really dangerous repercussions. ""That hasn't stopped some accounts on X claiming to do open-source investigations from rapidly pushing out definitive takes which later turn out to be wrong. ""Right now [X] is an absolute misinformation and disinformation crisis, and that environment is uniquely unhelpful to getting to a shared understanding of what happened and trying to make sure there's accountability around what looks like a pretty clear disaster,"" Scott-Railton said.",npr_articles/article_325.txt,npr_results/article_325.txt.json
326,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/19/1206832708/biden-israel-trip-mideast-peace,"Normally, when a U. S. president visits Israel, there are weeks or months of planning and preparations. But President Biden's trip this week, following the brazen Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas, came at a time that was anything but normal. The high-stakes visit served simultaneously to illustrate the limits and the capability of U. S. influence in the region, and the importance of America's long-standing relationship with Israel. It also inevitably ties the administration to whatever comes next, analysts say — including more deadly Israeli airstrikes in the densely populated Gaza Strip, targeting Hamas, and the possibility of a bloody ground campaign, where civilian casualties could quickly mount, further inflaming anger among Israel's Arab neighbors. So far, more than 3,400 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. While Biden's 31-hour visit was largely symbolic, he also managed concrete accomplishments. These included announcing $100 million in aid to the Palestinians, and convincing Israel to agree to allow humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza and persuading Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sissi to open up a vital land crossing into southern Gaza. In a 15-minute televised speech Thursday from the Oval Office after returning from Israel, Biden sought to leverage the moment to go directly to average Americans. Drawing a parallel between U. S. support for Ukraine and Israel, Biden said that while the two conflicts ""can seem far away,"" they are ""vital for America's national security. """"History has taught us when terrorists don't pay a price for their terror, when dictators don't pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction,"" Biden said. ""They keep going. And the cost and the threat to America and the world keep rising. ""The president on Friday asked Congress for almost $106 billion for Israel, Ukraine, countering China in the Indo-Pacific, and operations on the southern U. S. border. In Israel, Biden sought to make U. S. support crystal clear — but also to warn Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that a proportional response to the Hamas attacks means protecting the lives of innocent Palestinians. The visit almost didn't happen. Biden said his team weighed whether it should even take place. Secretary of State Antony Blinken laid the groundwork in a whirlwind visit to the Middle East last week that included seven hours of talks with Netanyahu and his war cabinet. The president met with families of victims of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks and with first responders. ""This is . . . almost the equivalent of trips to American disaster areas,"" says Thomas Schwartz, a historian at Vanderbilt University. It was symbolic, he says, and was meant to show ""how tightly Israel and concerns about Israel"" are embedded in the American political system. The trip served to reassure Israel that Biden ""prioritizes the need for the U. S. to actually engage in this question, rather than step back from it,"" says Brian Katulis, vice president of policy at the Middle East Institute. That message of engagement was not only directed at Israel, but also to the rest of the Middle East — particularly Iran and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militia it backs, Katulis says. Biden's visit reinforced his earlier warnings, in addition to the hard-power signals sent by U. S. deployment of carrier task groups to the eastern Mediterranean. ""The main threat right now is the prospect of Iran and their proxy in Lebanon joining in,"" says Itamar Rabinovich, a former Israeli ambassador to the U. S. He says Biden and U. S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ""were very clear in warning Iran and Hezbollah, and this was a major contribution by the Biden administration to consolidating the status quo. ""But a planned meeting between Biden and regional leaders fell apart after a catastrophic explosion at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds of Palestinians just hours before the president landed in Israel. Biden had planned to stop in Amman, Jordan, where he was scheduled for discussions with Jordan's King Abdullah II, Egypt's El-Sissi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. The Arab leaders called off the meeting following the hospital explosion. ""I don't think the door is shut between the Biden administration and the key Arab countries just because of the cancellation of the meeting in Amman,"" Katulis says. Biden said he also wants to help Israel avoid some of the mistakes the U. S. made in its ""war on terror"" following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by al-Qaida. ""Justice must be done,"" the president said in Israel. ""But I caution this: While you feel that rage, don't be consumed by it. After 9/11 we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes. ""Katulis says ""there's genuine concern"" among U. S. officials about civilian casualties and ""how that can negatively impact the mission itself and achieving the desired goals that Israel has stated. ""The U. S. , he says, wants ""to help Israelis learn from the lessons"" the U. S. learned in Afghanistan and Iraq. ""Was Netanyahu and his government receptive? It remains uncertain at this time, and time will tell as the Gaza war unfolds,"" Katulis says. Israeli officials estimate Hamas militants took about 200 hostages with them back to Gaza. A White House readout of discussions between Biden and Netanyahu said the two ""discussed ongoing efforts to secure the release of hostages taken by Hamas — including Americans. ""Days after Biden's return from Israel, Hamas announced the release of two American hostages on Friday. Secretary of State Blinken said 10 U. S. citizens who had been in Israel were still unaccounted for and some are believed to be held hostage by Hamas. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby has said the U. S. is ""actively trying to find out exactly where"" the American hostages are located and is doing its utmost to gain their release. ""I think there's some hope in the fact that President Biden himself had prioritized this and talked directly to some of the families of the hostages,"" Katulis says. But he calls the fate of those American captives ""a big open question. """,npr_articles/article_326.txt,npr_results/article_326.txt.json
327,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/19/1207093094/biden-is-giving-an-oval-office-address-to-push-for-more-spending-on-israel-and-u,"President Biden gave a rare Oval Office address Thursday night to make the case that it is in Americans' best interests to hike funding for Israel after the deadly Hamas attack — and to support additional funding for Ukraine, embroiled in its long fight against Russia. During the 15 minute speech to the nation, Biden drew a connection between Russia and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which attacked Israel on Oct. 7 and sparked the current war. ""They both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy, completely annihilate it,"" Biden said, noting that Iran supports both President Vladimir Putin and Hamas. The Oval Office backdrop is a signal of the gravity that Biden places on these national security matters. The speech was only the second time he has spoken to the nation from behind the Resolute Desk; the first was in June, after the debt ceiling crisis was averted. Biden said he would send a formal request for funding to Congress on Friday, but the fate of the proposal, which is expected to be billions of dollars, is unclear. For one thing, the Republican-led House of Representatives does not currently have a speaker, making it impossible to consider any such funding package. There is also waning public support — primarily among Republicans — of increasing spending for Ukraine. In its most recent government funding bill, Congress failed to include $24 billion to keep military and economic aid flowing to Ukraine until the end of the year. Biden said he knows Americans wonder why they should spend money on faraway conflicts. But he warned of more ""chaos, death and destruction"" and ultimately higher costs for America if Hamas or Putin don't pay a price for their actions. ""Putin has turned to Iran and North Korea to buy attack drones and ammunition to terrorize Ukrainian cities and people from the outset,"" he said. Noting that the administration does not intend to send American troops to fight in Ukraine, Biden added: ""All Ukraine is asking for is help for the weapons, munitions, the capacity, the capability to push invading Russian forces off their land and the air defense system to shoot down Russian missiles before they destroy Ukrainian cities. ""The president warned that if Putin and Hamas go unchecked, other aggressors would be emboldened in the Indo-Pacific or Middle East. While the White House has so far withheld the size of the imminent defense aid package, Biden tried to appeal to the public's sense of safety here at home and around the world, calling the request a ""smart investment that's going to pay dividends for American security for generations. ""Thursday's remarks came just after Biden returned from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv, where he pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet on their military strategy to fight Hamas. And as he did on that visit, the president walked a fine line in his address, pronouncing his unequivocal support for Israel while also expressing concerns about civilians in Gaza. He was again adamant that Israel has a right to defend itself and pledged to ask for ""an unprecedented"" support package for Israel's defense. Still, he reiterated words of caution to Israel, urging leaders not to give in to feelings of hate. ""As hard as it is, we cannot give up on peace. We cannot give up on a two-state solution. Israel and Palestinians equally deserve to live in safety, dignity and peace,"" Biden said. Biden also urged Americans to denounce antisemitism, Islamophobia and other forms of hate like the kind that apparently fueled the murder of a young Palestinian-American boy outside Chicago over the weekend. ""His name was Wadea. Wadea,"" Biden said. ""A proud American, a proud Palestinian American family. We can't stand by and stand silent when this happens. ""The White House said Biden spoke with the 6-year-old's father and uncle after his address to express condolences. In his formal request to Congress, it's possible Biden could ask for more funding for Taiwan, as well, though he did not raise this in Thursday's remarks. He had also previously asked Congress for $4 billion in funding to deal with fentanyl trafficking and issues at the southern U. S. border, but that money also was left out of this fall's funding bill. Both funding for Taiwan and border security are elements some Republican leaders in Congress have shown support for. ""In the coming days, it will be the Senate's responsibility to take strong and decisive action to put support behind Israel's self-defense, equip Ukraine for victory . . . and help Taiwan deter growing threats,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday. Combining several different issues into one bill could be a risky move in a divided Congress, but Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, told NPR it could help broaden support for the funding. ""I'm hopeful that it actually broadens the support for members of Congress who are focused on different issues,"" Sullivan said. ""And as you know, a lot of times in the Congress, things happen where you get a bill or a funding package that you don't agree with everything, but if you agree with a lot of it, it can broaden the support.

Thousands of people across the United States are attending vigils to commemorate the civilians killed from the ongoing conflict. Earlier last week, hundreds of people gathered in Washington, D. C. , to show support for the victims of the Hamas attacks. People wrapped around the block as they waited in line to attend the vigil that was held at the synagogue of the Adas Israel Congregation in Cleveland Park. Susie Weinrauch said she didn't mind the wait. ""I don't like lines, but I think this is a great cause and I'm glad they're doing it and wherever I can show support, I will"" Weinrauch said. Yosh Halberstein felt similarly, sharing that ""the minimum that I could do is just show up and show solidarity. ""Many of the attendees were grappling with mourning the lives lost and the ongoing violence. ""It's hard because it just feels like it's not gonna stop for a while and after a while I just kind of go numb,"" said Matthew Gever. Miguel Tablo, who has family in Israel, said his initial reaction after hearing that Hamas militants were attacking Israel was one of ""profound sadness for the events and anger because we find ourselves again here after all this time with needless loss of life for absolutely no reason. ""The vigil was organized by The Jewish Federation of Greater Washington, the JCRC of Greater Washington, and the Charles and Lynn Schusterman Family Philanthropies. D. C. Mayor Muriel Bowser attended the congregation and spoke along with other leaders of the Jewish community. She reaffirmed her support for ""the Jewish community in DC, in Israel, and around the world. ""Among the attendees was Hunter Benson, who is converting to Judaism. She's visited the synagogue multiple times prior to the vigil and expressed her desire to show support for her community. ""I feel that I am compelled to support the community right now. Always, but specifically ,– with what's going on in Israel and just for the loss of humanity that's happening over there right now,"" Benson said. While other members of the community came to comfort one another. ""I'm seeing terrible reports of just barbaric acts and, needed to be around the community tonight for, for some support,"" said Samantha Goldstein. As the violence in Palestine and Israel escalates, people are coming together to stand in solidarity. Last week, New Yorkers in Washington Square Park honored and mourned both Israeli and Palestinian lives that have been lost. Several hundred Harvard students attended a silent vigil on October 12 to express solidarity with Palenstine and mourn the deaths of civilians in Gaza and Israel. While thousands came together across LA county for vigils to support the people of Isreal and Palestine — including those held at UC San Diego and Westwood. Adam Shaukat, who is both Muslim and Jewish, attended the Washington Square Park vigil. He has family and friends in Israel and Gaza. ""I've woken up to some really violent stories of friends of friends being kidnapped and murdered and hiding behind their friends bodies to survive fire fights and it's just really horrible,"" Shaukat told NY1. The devastating news reminded Shaukat to ""be slow, be soft, be gentle and hug your loved ones.

S. -based humanitarian organization Anera delivered about 47,000 hot meals to Palestinians in Gaza. It was a feat of logistics, says CEO Sean Carroll – and also not even close to enough. ""That portion of chicken and rice is probably going to be shared by at least two, maybe three or four or five family members, and will probably be the only meal of the day,"" Carroll says. ""And if that goes away, then it is not hyperbole to suggest that people could die of hunger or certainly the combination of thirst and hunger. "" Aid groups have been scrambling to mobilize whatever food stores are left within Gaza, while they wait for the governments in Israel, Egypt and the United States to arrange safe passage across the Egyptian border. A deal struck on Thursday by Egypt and Israel and brokered by the United Nations to permit some aid to enter Gaza was characterized as ""a start"" by the World Health Organization. Bringing the aid to those in need will be ""an absolute marathon,"" Dr. Richard Brennan, the WHO's Regional Emergency Director for the Eastern Mediterranean Region, told CNN. He noted that there are ""a lot of complexities to getting this aid operation going. ""Israel has kept Gaza under ""siege"" since fighters with Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, attacked Israeli villages last week, killing more than 1,400 and taking nearly 200 hostages. Since then, the situation on the ground for besieged and hungry Gaza residents is growing increasingly desperate. Bread is becoming especially scarce. The U. N. 's World Food Programme says that of the five flour mills in Gaza, only one is operating, due to fuel and energy shortages. Just five of the 23 bakeries WFP contracts with are open. One aid worker in Gaza, a staffer for Islamic Relief Worldwide, says families are scraping together whatever food they can find. The worker asked to remain anonymous out of concerns for their safety ahead of a possible Israeli ground invasion. ""It takes 2 hours just to get some bread. The bakeries started giving people tickets for their share so that everyone can get some,"" he said, communicating via an overseas colleague in response to questions from NPR. ""My brother-in-law found [a shop] making falafel, which was previously very common but is now a big surprise. He bought some and made us all happy that night. ""Fresh water is also growing extremely scarce, the worker says. ""My mum tries to think of meals that would use less water to cook and less dishes to wash up,"" the worker says. """"At my parents' house there are around 20 children and 7 adults sheltering, so there is a huge demand for water for washing, cooking, cleaning. Even with so many people here we only flush the toilet twice a day – once in the morning, once at night. "" Even as people in Gaza try to stretch their meager food supplies, some 310 tons of food from the World Food Programme – enough fortified biscuits, date bars and canned fish to feed nearly a quarter-million people for a week – is sitting in a line of trucks at the Gaza border with Egypt. Other aid convoys waiting in Egypt carry medical supplies and drinking water. Planeloads of food from Dubai have been arriving at the nearby Egyptian city of Arish. Just when and how much aid would be permitted under this week's UN-backed agreement remains unclear. President Joe Biden said Thursday that aid could begin flowing as soon as Friday. However, at that time only 20 trucks – a fraction of the massed convoys – had been cleared to move once the crossing is opened. That has left the Rafah crossing a parking lot for humanitarian aid. ""The trucks [at the Rafah crossing] are cooling their heels. We have vehicles in convoy ready to roll that are not being permitted in,"" says Steve Taravella, spokesperson for the World Food Programme. Meanwhile, Gaza residents are increasingly desperate for food and water. Taravella estimates that the WFP has about two weeks worth of food supplies already placed inside Gaza and ready to distribute. ""People are definitely going hungry now. They are rationing out amongst themselves what they have been able to conserve,"" says the WFP's Taravella. Aid groups unable to cross the border are working to apportion what limited food remains in Gaza to people in need. Sean Carroll of Anera says the Gaza shops and food retailers he works with are down to 2-3 days worth of food. Lack of water, sanitation and nutrition also raise the risk for infectious disease outbreaks, in a territory where hospitals are already overwhelmed by the wounded. Even before the current crisis, the population in the Gaza Strip was beset by food scarcity. The WFP estimates that a third of Palestinians in Gaza were food insecure already, which the WFP defines as people having to sell their possessions or use essential resources in order to subsist on a basic diet. Some 80% are considered in need of humanitarian aid. In many cases, the workers who power the food-aid system in Gaza are themselves victims. ""Two of our staff lost several family members. One of them lost ten family members to a bomb and one lost 16 family members to a bomb,"" says Sean Carroll, adding, ""it's hard to believe and understand that those words are true, even as I say them. "" Sean Carroll says of Anera's 12 staffers in Gaza, nearly all have been evacuated to the south. Bombing near the southern border with Egypt is further complicating efforts to open the way for aid. Humanitarian groups say even if the gates were flung open, it wouldn't be safe to get the aid to people who need it. With at least some aid expected to move as soon as the Thursday agreement takes effect, the World Food Programme and others are calling for a secure humanitarian corridor into Gaza, with safety guarantees that go beyond simply opening the crossing. ""A secure corridor is absolutely essential,"" says WFP's Taravella, ""both a corridor into Gaza, but also a corridor or corridors within Gaza to help aid workers move around freely, to distribute this food and frankly, to help civilians feel safe and be safe to come out to seek food.

330,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/19/1206720312/biden-israel-palestinians-presidents-mideast-peace,"President Biden is now the latest in a long line of U. S. presidents to place himself in the middle of a Middle East conflict. In an unusual wartime visit, Biden arrived in Israel on Wednesday, hours after a catastrophic blast at a Gaza hospital. During his visit, the president said it was important for him to ""personally come"" as a signal of U. S. support for Israel. He told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that ""Americans are grieving with you, they really are. And Americans are worried. """"I understand and many Americans understand,"" the president said. ""You can't look at what has happened here to your mothers, your fathers, your grandparents, sons, daughters, children, even babies and not scream out for justice. Justice must be done. But I caution this — while you feel that rage, don't be consumed by it. After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes. ""The president was referring to Israel's response in the Gaza Strip to the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks that killed more than 1,400 Israelis, with about 200 kidnapped and held hostage. There have been ongoing airstrikes, and preparations for an expected ground assault on Gaza that is sure to kill many Palestinian civilians — inflaming tensions on the West Bank and around the region. More than 3,400 people have been killed in Israel's attacks on Gaza, and more than 12,000 injured, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Here's a look at U. S. efforts to broker peace over the past 45 years — full of failed starts, wrong turns and dead ends, but also some progress. The first major effort by a U. S. president to foster peace in the region came a decade after the 1967 Six-Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbors, Egypt, Jordan and Syria. In that war, Israel occupied Syria's Golan Heights and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula — losses those countries fought unsuccessfully to reverse in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. In 1977, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat told U. S. media he was ready to travel to Israel to meet face-to-face with Prime Minister Menachem Begin. President Jimmy Carter, who had little foreign policy experience at the time, agreed to step in and try to broker a comprehensive deal that would not only result in peace between Israel and Egypt, but would also attempt to resolve Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. He hosted the leaders at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland. Carter and his secretary of state, Cyrus Vance, aimed to accomplish Arab recognition of Israel's right to exist, Israel's withdrawal from territories it had occupied since the end of the Six-Day War, a guarantee that Israel's security would not be threatened and securing an undivided Jerusalem. Carter was a committed intermediary, but Sadat and Begin did not get along, according to the former president. ""For the first three days,"" Carter recalled, ""I attempted to have Begin and Sadat come together. The two men were totally incompatible. . . shouting, banging on the table, stalking out of the rooms. So for the next 10 days, they never saw each other. We negotiated with them isolated from one another. ""Eventually, the two sides came together. The official agreements that emerged are known as the ""Framework for Peace in the Middle East. "" The deal recognized the ""legitimate rights of the Palestinian people"" and full autonomy within five years for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, territories that had been controlled by Jordan and Egypt, respectively, prior to the Six-Day War. But the U. S. State Department's own history notes, ""The talks failed to produce much as Palestinian representatives refused to participate, and the gap between Egyptian and Israeli positions on Palestinian self-government, not to mention their respective stances on Israeli settlements in Gaza and the West Bank and the legal status of East Jerusalem, proved unbridgeable. ""However, separate from the Camp David Accords, a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, signed in Washington, D. C. , on March 26, 1979, is the lasting legacy of Carter's efforts, says James Hershberg, a professor of history in international affairs at George Washington University. Carter ""was deeply involved"" in negotiations for the Israel-Egypt deal, Hershberg says, shuttling between Cairo and Israel to finalize it. Although relations between Israel and Egypt have frequently been strained since then, the basic peace has endured, despite the 1981 assassination of Sadat by Islamic extremists in Cairo. Many in the Islamic world cheered Sadat's assassination, regarding the Egyptian leader as a traitor for having made peace with Israel. ""[F]or most Arabs he had betrayed the Palestinian cause at the Maryland summit meeting and was considered a traitor and an outcast by 1981,"" Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote in 2021. The administration of George H. W. Bush tried, and largely failed, to move the peace deal forward, says Eric Altman, a professor at City University of New York, Brooklyn College, and author of We Are Not One: A History of America's Fight Over Israel. Bush's secretary of state, James Baker, spent months trying to bring representatives of the Arab nations together with Israel, eventually getting Egypt, Syria and Lebanon to attend talks hosted by Spain and co-sponsored by the United States and the Soviet Union. A joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation was also present. The Madrid Conference was co-chaired by Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, just months before the collapse of the U. S. S. R. ""The great alleged victory of the Madrid Conference is that there were face-to-face negotiations,"" Altman says. However, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir gave no ground. Shamir ""refused everything and he never offered anything,"" Altman says. ""Baker is considered a genius for bringing Madrid together, and he did work very hard for it — but all he got was a meeting. ""President Bill Clinton, although largely focused on U. S. domestic issues — particularly in his first term — nonetheless hoped that his administration could pick up the pieces of the Camp David Accords, including finding a two-state solution that would satify both Israel and the Palestinians. Initially, however, Clinton and his advisers believed it would be better to try to bring Israel and Syria together, reasoning that Israel's leaders would find it ""politically easier to pull back from the Golan Heights than to withdraw from the West Bank,"" as the Palestinians wanted, according to the State Department. What eventually came to be known as the Oslo Accords started as secret negotiations in the Norwegian capital. Subsequently, Clinton brought Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin together. The agreement they reached was signed in Washington just a month after Oslo talks concluded. The signing ceremony yielded a famous photo of Clinton presiding over a handshake between the two men. The agreement saw Israel officially recognize the PLO as representatives of the Palestinian people and a partner in future negotiations. It also set a five-year time frame for establishment of a Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The PLO, in turn, renounced terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist in peace, bringing an end to the Palestinians' first Intifada or uprising against Israel that had begun in 1987 — and spawned a more radical offshoot of the PLO, known as Hamas. The deal raised expectations for a ""two-state solution"" that would eventually lead to Palestinian statehood. It seemed like significant progress, but the spirit of the agreement was quickly undone, Hershberg says. And almost immediately, the ""two-state solution"" began unraveling. ""First you had the eruption of very violent protests on the West Bank and then a very violent Israeli suppression,"" he says. A 1994 attack on a mosque in Hebron, carried out by an American Jewish settler on the West Bank, caused Palestinian sentiments to boil. Then came the 1995 assassination of Rabin by an Israeli settler opposed to the agreement. Rabin had come to symbolize the Oslo Accords, and his death marked their symbolic collapse. ""Rabin's assassination in 1995 pretty much put an end to those hopes"" for peace, says Patrick Maney, a retired Boston College history professor and author of Bill Clinton: New Gilded Age President. But in 2000, toward the end of Clinton's second term, Rabin's successor, Prime Minster Ehud Barak, wanted to try again to reach a deal with the Palestinians. Clinton, Barak and Arafat met at Camp David. ""Clinton hoped to replicate . . . Jimmy Carter's success by inviting the Israelis and Palestinians to Camp David,"" Maney says. But the Palestinian leader was a reluctant participant, CUNY professor Altman says. ""Arafat didn't want to come to Camp David because he didn't think that they had been prepared sufficiently in advance or he wasn't ready or he didn't want peace,"" he says. The Clinton team outlined plans for a Palestinian state that would encompass Gaza and a large part of the West Bank. ""There were security considerations taken into account, and even compensation plans for refugees who had been displaced from their homes in 1948"" in the formation of the Israeli state, Maney says. Clinton would ""table hop"" between the Israeli and the Palestinian delegations at Camp David, Maney says. ""He would sit with the Palestinian delegates and then he'd go over and talk to the Israelis and go back and forth. And there were a couple of all-nighters where he was meeting with representatives of the delegations. ""But still no agreement ever made it onto paper, and the talks fell apart, with Arafat apparently still thinking the deal did not offer enough. ""A lot of people on the Clinton team, they said this was close,"" Maney says. ""Barak had said yes to all all of this, and Arafat had said no. And so Clinton really blamed Arafat. . . . There is some, I have to say, dispute about that in retrospect. ""Altman says that to get Arafat to the table, Clinton promised him that ""if [the talks] broke down that he would not be blamed. And then Clinton blamed him. ""The al-Qaida attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the subsequent ""war on terror"" so preoccupied the administration of President George W. Bush that Middle East peace efforts were put on hold. Bush, like President Donald Trump later, believed that strong U. S. support for Israel was enough to give it ""the confidence to make significant concessions to the Palestinians and peace [would] become possible,"" Altman says. Bush's successor, President Barack Obama, made ending Israeli settlements in the West Bank a key position in U. S. relations with Israel, but did not meet with much success, Altman says. Obama's first trip as president to the region, in June 2009, was to Egypt, where he delivered a speech aimed at reassuring the Muslim world that ""America and Islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition. "" His first presidential trip to Israel didn't come until 2013. ""Most people think Obama made two big mistakes,"" Altman says. ""The first one was going to Egypt first thing and not stopping off in Israel. The second was demanding a freeze on [Israeli] settlements"" in the West Bank. ""The Israelis didn't like Obama. They didn't trust Obama,"" Altman says. Despite Secretary of State John Kerry's own version of shuttle diplomacy, he was never able to make much progress, Altman says. ""After Oslo, the idea was to build up trust"" between Israel and the Palestinians, ""so that each could make further concessions, so there could be an actual peace agreement between them,"" he says. ""The opposite happened. Both sides dug in and tried to fortify their positions. ""In 2020, then-President Trump announced ""the dawn of a new Middle East"" at a White House signing ceremony for the latest peace effort, the Abraham Accords, normalizing relations between Israel and several Arab states — the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and later, Morocco and Sudan. Altman calls the Abraham Accords ""probably a net negative"" because they ignored the most fundamental issue: the Palestinians. The deal was ""mostly the result of a fear of Iran and Shiite countries as opposed to any acceptance [by the signatories] of Israel's legitimacy,"" Hershberg says. So, what about Biden's wartime trip to Israel on Wednesday, as bombs dropped on the Gaza Strip and dreams of peace seem to have receded into the distant past?On Wednesday, Biden met with Netanyahu and in remarks ahead of their bilateral in Tel Aviv, the Israeli leader thanked his U. S. counterpart, saying ""the world sees that support in the moral clarity that you have demonstrated from the moment Israel was attacked. "" Biden emphasized his administration's full support to Israel and said he was impressed by the ""courage"" of the Israeli people. ""It's really stunning. I'm proud to be here,"" the president said. At Biden's urging, Israel agreed to allow some aid into Gaza and the U. S. announced $100 million in humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. History will be the judge of his visit's impact — but the involvement of U. S. presidents in trying to foster Middle East peace seems likely to continue, even as specific goals change. Speaking on NPR's All Things Considered on Tuesday, journalist and editor Susan Glasser, had this to say: ""The failure of the great dream of so many American presidents, this idea that there was a viable two-state solution to be negotiated and that the U. S. president would become the broker of that . . . that foundered, and really is sort of no longer even really flickering as a dream of U. S. presidents. ""That may be true for now, says Hershberg, and probably for the foreseeable future. ""But,"" he says, ""if anything's ever going to happen, a U. S. role is inevitable — because it clearly has the most leverage. """,npr_articles/article_330.txt,npr_results/article_330.txt.json
331,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/19/1207037984/josh-paul-resign-state-department-military-assistance-israel-gaza,"A State Department official has resigned from the bureau that oversees arms transfers to foreign nations, citing his objection to continued U. S. military assistance to Israel as its retaliatory bombardment and blockade of Gaza exacerbate a humanitarian crisis there. Josh Paul was the director of congressional and public affairs at the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. In a two-page letter posted on LinkedIn, he said he had made a promise to himself when he joined over a decade ago that he would stay ""as long as I felt the harm I might do could be outweighed by the good I could do. """"I am leaving today because I believe that in our current course with regards to the continued — indeed, expanded and expedited — provision of lethal arms to Israel — I have reached the end of that bargain,"" he wrote. Paul tendered his resignation on Wednesday, the same day that President Biden visited Israel in a public show of support. The president pledged his commitment to its security and promised a congressional request for more defense funding, even as he urged Israelis not to be consumed by their rage and directed $100 million in humanitarian aid for Palestinians. Paul wrote in his letter that he was heartened to see the administration's efforts to temper Israel's response, including its advocacy for the provision of relief, supplies and safe passage for civilians in Gaza. But he said he could not work in support of a set of major policy decisions — including ""rushing more arms to one side of the conflict"" — that he believes to be ""shortsighted, destructive, unjust, and contradictory to the very values that we publicly espouse. ""The State Department declined to comment on personnel matters. In an interview with Morning Edition's Michel Martin, Paul strongly denounced Hamas' attack on Israel and affirmed Israel's right to defend itself. But he said there are ""ways to do that that don't involve dislocating a million Palestinians, that don't involve the death of thousands of civilians. "" ""We never seem to ask, well, what about the Palestinian right? Not to face incursions in their villages, not to be bombed from the air,"" he added. ""So I think looking at this on equal terms, we have to talk about both sides. "" Paul said he doesn't expect his departure to lead to an immediate change in policy — an assessment several experts also made to NPR. But he said he hoped to accomplish two things: remove himself from a debate that he found difficult, and show others in the government ""that it's OK and possible to stand up. ""Paul said he's received a huge outpouring of support after posting his resignation letter — which has since been reposted more than 1,000 times — and hopes his colleagues grappling with similar feelings take that to heart. ""And I hope they see that and that it speaks to them to do the right thing as well, which I know so many of them will,"" he said. Paul noted in his letter that while his work dealt with many countries, he was particularly well-versed in Middle East issues: He wrote his master's thesis on Israeli counterterrorism and civil rights, spent time working with the Palestinian Authority and Israel Defense Forces while serving for the U. S. Security in Ramallah and has ""deep personal ties"" to both sides of the conflict. He wrote that he's ""made more moral compromises than I can recall"" over his last 11 years in the job. He told NPR that he used his position to fight many times for what he believed to be right, including debates over arms transfers to ""a number of unsavory regimes. "" But this time is different, he says. ""The difference here is that in all of those cases — when those within the department and the interagency with human rights concerns had done all the shaping they could — you knew the next step was for the sale to go to Congress where it would be held, debated, even voted against,"" he explained. ""But with Israel, it's a blank check from Congress. There's no appetite for debate. There's no real debate internal to the administration. And then there's no one to hand the debate off to. "" While there is some disagreement on the far left when it comes to support for Israel, Congress as a whole is unlikely to be divided when it comes to supporting Israel, at least in the short term. Paul said the first thing he'd like the Biden administration to do is ""simply follow their own public commitments. "" He explains that the administration's new conventional arms transfer policy, enacted earlier this year, explicitly states that no transfers will be authorized under which the U. S. assesses that ""it is more likely than not that the arms to be transferred will be used by the recipient to commit, facilitate the recipients' commission of, or to aggravate risks that the recipient will commit: genocide; crimes against humanity; grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949. "" Those include attacks directed against civilians and other serious violations of international humanitarian or human rights law, including acts of violence against children.  ""So I think for us to look at the current situation and say the answer is as many bombs as Israel asks for, knowing that their use will lead in a direction exactly opposite to our stated policy goals . . . it's disappointing, to say the least,"" Paul said. Experts on diplomacy told NPR that while it's too soon to see what if any ripple effects Paul resignation will have, it's unlikely to impact U. S. policy. Ronald Neumann, the president of the American Academy of Diplomacy and a former U. S. ambassador to Afghanistan, says there are two things a State Department employee can do when they disagree with a U. S. policy: resign or ask to be moved to another job. ""Often people have to deal with exactly what Josh Paul mentioned in his letter, which is balancing the good they might do by staying in a position or by remaining in a policy fight against having to carry out policy they don't agree with,"" he adds. He says such resignations happen periodically. For example: The U. S. ambassador to Panama stepped down in 2018, citing irreconcilable differences with former President Donald Trump, and several State Department officials resigned over objections to the U. S. ' Bosnia policy in the 1990s. ""I do not know that any of such resignations have ever had an effect on the department writ large or that they have a major effect on policy,"" Neumann says, adding that he's not surprised Paul has received support from many coworkers but doesn't expect it to lead to much. The State Department is the rare cabinet agency with an official internal mechanism that allows employees to voice concerns about U. S. policy, Neumann points out. It's called the Dissent Channel, and was born out of the Vietnam War. Employees can express policy disagreements in classified messages that go to the secretary of state, without fear of retaliation. ""It's important for that active policy discussion and dissent that people do respect their professional obligation to either keep dissent inside the organization or to do what Mr. Paul has done and resign and take it outside,"" Neumann said, adding that it's important for people to be able to draw their own line. Dissent cables don't guarantee changes in policy, though some have happened. A 1992 memo about U. S. inaction towards genocide in Bosnia, for example, is widely credited with helping bring about the U. S. -brokered peace accords there. The channel usually gets four to five such cables each year, but saw surges at times during the Obama and Trump administrations. Tom Yazdgerdi, the president of the American Foreign Service Association, told NPR over email that the union hasn't seen any signs that foreign service members are contemplating resigning over the U. S. response to the Israel-Hamas war. He says there's been more concern about the safety and security of family members of diplomatic personnel working in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Beirut — and the State Department has addressed it by providing authorized departure to eligible individuals and employees.

332,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/19/1206479861/israel-gaza-hamas-children-population-war-palestinians,"When Fidaa Al-Araj received the pre-recorded message last week telling her to evacuate her home because the area was about to be bombed, she first thought of her children. To her surprise, they had actually beaten her to the street. The day before, an Israeli airstrike had hit her cousin's house, killing his wife, mother and children. Those kids were close to Al-Araj's children in age. They were friends. ""My daughter said to me, 'What are you waiting for?'"" Al-Araj recalled. ""'Yesterday, we were crying for our cousins. Do you want people to cry over our dead bodies today?' So I had to leave. ""The family left their home in Gaza City and started a days-long journey to Rafah, in southern Gaza, where NPR reached her by phone this week. Al-Araj, 39, is a mother of five, aged 13, 12, 10, 8 and 2. The current war in Gaza isn't their first, and the family is part of a striking trend: the population is one of the youngest in the world. Nearly half (47. 3%) are under 18. According to the Ministry of Health in Gaza on Wednesday, more than 3,470 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel began its bombardment in response to the attack by the militant group Hamas on October 7. Of those, about 1,200 have been children, according to the Defense for Children International — Palestine on Wednesday. Here's why the population skews so young, what it means for this war, and what it means for the future. The population of the Gaza Strip is 2. 2 million. The narrow slice of land covering 140 square miles — roughly the size of Las Vegas — is one of the most densely populated places on earth. Two-thirds of the Palestinians living in Gaza are refugees or their descendants from the 1948 war, and most of the population is Muslim. There is also a small native Palestinian Christian population. Since 2007, Gaza has been under a strict land and sea blockade by Israel that prevents civilians, along with goods like food and medicine, from easily moving across the border, contributing to harsh economic conditions and high poverty levels. Culturally, education has remained a top priority. More than 95% of children aged 6-12 in Gaza attend school, and most graduate from high school. Additionally, 57% of students at the Islamic University of Gaza are female. The drive for attaining education is part cultural, part pride, and it all goes back to the 1948 displacement, says Maha Nassar, an associate professor in the School of Middle Eastern and North African Studies at the University of Arizona. ""So many Palestinians lost their lives and their livelihood,"" she told NPR. ""And so they wanted their children, and then later their grandchildren, to be able to do something that they could take with them even if they were displaced again. And so education came to be seen as the mechanism to do that. ""The reasons are varied. Many Palestinians simply don't get the chance to grow old — dying in their early adulthood either in conflicts or due to a struggling healthcare system — which drags the averages down. The 16-year blockade has hampered fast access to medical care and caused shortages of essential supplies like gauze and I. V. bags, says Yara Asi — an assistant professor of global health management and informatics at the University of Central Florida, and the author of the upcoming book, How War Kills. ""Preventive care is basically nonexistent,"" she said. ""They're constantly dealing with short-term health issues, and those that need chronic care either don't get it or have to leave. ""And to be able to leave for medical treatment, residents have to apply for a permit that's notoriously difficult to obtain. Another factor for the young population in Gaza is that people tend to marry in their early twenties, according to 2021 data by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.  And the fertility rate (births per woman) is 3. 38, according to a U. S. Census Bureau estimate. This is compared to 1. 84 in the U. S. ""Some research has shown in Palestinian populations, and others under threat, that they see having children as a way of resistance, in a way,"" Asi said. ""That's kind of seen as a continuation of a bloodline that's been under threat in various ways for 100 years. ""For Al-Araj and her five children, it means constant vigilance. Even before this conflict began, Al-Araj had a rule: her kids must always stay within her eyesight. Still, this moment feels different, she says. She knows of families where both parents were killed in Israeli airstrikes, and only the children survived. Or, in some cases, only one child survived. She said she talked with her two oldest daughters, Rita and Ilham, aged 13 and 12, about what they should do if their parents are killed. She told them where they keep the money and the essential documents, and who they should contact. ""They were shocked like, 'What are you saying?' And I was like, 'Khalas, maybe I'm next. I hope I'm next if we are next, not you,'"" she said. ""I know this is a huge burden to dump on my kids, but this is the reality of life because, I mean, what are they going to do?""The number of children also has a practical effect, with some families reporting they simply don't have the means to travel with kids and also have nowhere to go. ""Where can we go as a family of five or six people?"" one man told the BBC. Multiple conflicts, the blockade, and harsh living conditions have had a compounding effect. A 2021 report by the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor found 91% of Gazan children suffered from conflict-related trauma. A 2022 report by Save The Children found 80% of children reported emotional distress — up from 55% in 2018. Asi said there are still many unknowns, but the outlook is bleak. ""These children are out of school. These children are completely traumatized,"" she said. ""There's no good news here. It's bad outcomes all around, not just today, but for future generations who, for those who survive, grow up with this history and this trauma. ""Still, Nassar, from the University of Arizona, says something can be done. Some of her cousins are in Gaza and have already lived through several wars. ""They know how to laugh. They know how to make jokes. They know how to enjoy life,"" she said. ""We cannot fail them by telling them, 'OK, we're going to go put things back to the status quo until the next war. ' That's not an option. ""And she believes the children of Gaza deserve the chance to heal. ""They still have dreams, they still have hopes, they still have aspirations,"" she said. ""And I think that with the right support mechanisms in place, we can help them deal and sort through this trauma and help them. """,npr_articles/article_332.txt,npr_results/article_332.txt.json
333,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/19/1207031537/gaza-humanitarian-aid-friday,"JERUSALEM — The first shipments of humanitarian aid could begin to arrive in the Gaza Strip as soon as Friday, nearly two weeks after the start of a punishing Israeli bombardment campaign targeted at the militant group Hamas and after the U. S. State Department issued a travel warning for Americans as tensions continue to build. The humanitarian situation in Gaza has grown dire, aid groups say. Friday's delivery, if it takes place, would be the first since Israel halted the flow of food, water, electricity and fuel to the territory earlier this month, in retaliation for a wave of attacks by Hamas on Israeli towns near Gaza on Oct. 7. The deal was announced by President Biden late Wednesday after a visit to Israel, during which he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and later spoke by phone with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Israel says it will not lift its siege until Hamas has released some 200 hostages the group is believed to be holding. That has left only Egypt's Rafah border crossing, where trucks carrying some 3,000 tons of food, water and medicine are ""awaiting"" Egypt's approval to enter, the United Nations says. Officials hope that up to 20 trucks of aid could enter Gaza Friday after roads damaged by airstrikes have been repaired, Biden told reporters. Dozens more trucks will continue to stand by until another agreement has been reached. It is unclear if any fuel would be included in the shipment. With Gaza's main power plant unable to operate, aid groups say fuel is badly needed to power desalination and wastewater plants, along with hospital generators. Of concern has been the ability of the United Nations to distribute aid to civilians without the interference of Hamas — a challenge that has long vexed those seeking to aid Gaza residents. If Hamas ""doesn't let it get through or just confiscates it, then it's going to end,"" Biden said of the aid. On the Gaza side of the Rafah border, thousands of people have gathered in hopes of being allowed to exit the territory and escape the conflict. Israel has repeated its call for Palestinians to evacuate from northern Gaza to so-called safe zones in the southern part of the territory, ahead of a widely expected ground invasion. But Israeli bombardment has continued in southern Gaza, too. As many as 600 U. S. citizens are thought to be trapped in Gaza, U. S. officials say, but it was unclear whether any people would be allowed out if the border opens on Friday.  For 13 days, Israeli airstrikes have pummeled the Gaza Strip, leveling buildings and damaging infrastructure. More than 1 million Palestinians — roughly half of the territory's population — are estimated to have left their homes to seek shelter in central or southern Gaza, according to the United Nations. Palestinian officials say that Israeli airstrikes have destroyed more than 4,800 residential buildings in Gaza and damaged more than 120,000 housing units. Calls for a cease-fire have mounted since an explosion at Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, the cause of which remains in dispute. Reports of the death toll have varied; Gaza's Ministry of Health says the blast killed more than 470 people, most of whom were patients at the hospital or people who had come to the hospital's courtyard to seek a safe place to stay. The explosion sparked protests across the region, including in the occupied West Bank, where three Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces overnight.  Given the increased tensions globally, the State Department issued a travel advisory for Americans abroad. ""Due to increased tensions in various locations around the world, the potential for terrorist attacks, demonstrations or violent actions against U. S. citizens and interests, the Department of State advises U. S. citizens overseas to exercise increased caution,"" the agency said. It strongly advised travelers to stay alert in touristy areas. On Thursday, U. N. Secretary-General António Guterres arrived in Cairo to meet with officials there and to observe U. N. relief efforts as they prepare to enter Gaza ""at a moment of profound crisis . . . unlike any the region has seen in decades,"" he said. As he had earlier this week, Guterres again called for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire to help reach these goals. ""For nearly two weeks the people of Gaza have gone without any shipments of fuel, food, water, medicine, and other essentials. Disease is spreading. Supplies are dwindling. People are dying,"" Guterres said at a press conference on Thursday alongside Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. Guterres called on Hamas ""for the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages"" and on Israel ""for immediate unrestricted access of humanitarian aid"" for Gaza. As part of a wave of diplomatic efforts to address the crisis, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak arrived in Israel Thursday to meet Israeli officials and families of those impacted by the Hamas attack. Like Biden, Sunak supported Israel's ""right to defend itself  in line with international law, to go after Hamas, to take back hostages, deter further incursions and to strengthen your security for the long term. ""Among the some 200 hostages believed to have been taken by Hamas are British nationals, according to Sunak. He met with individuals whose family members were taken hostage. During his speech after meeting with Israeli officials, Sunak thanked Netanyahu ""for the support that your government has given to the families of British nationals caught up in this horror, including your efforts to secure the release of hostages, and I know that we will continue to cooperate, particularly with regard to the British nationals that are involved. ""French leader Emmanuel Macron is expected to follow in the coming days. At the U. N. Security Council Wednesday, the U. S. vetoed a resolution on the Israel-Hamas war that called for humanitarian pauses to allow delivery of aid to Gaza. Twelve of 15 council members voted in favor of the measure; Russia and the United Kingdom abstained. U. S. Ambassador to the U. N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the Security Council the U. S. was disappointed the draft resolution made no mention of Israel's inherent right to defend itself against attacks. She also noted that the U. S. had been working with the U. N. and others to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which she said was brought about by Hamas' own actions. About 1,400 people in Israel have been killed in the conflict, most of them on Oct. 7, Israeli officials say. Palestinian health officials say that the death toll in Gaza has reached 3,478, along with more than 60 dead in the West Bank. Biden is expected to give an Oval Office address on the conflict Thursday at 8 p. m. ET. NPR staffers Becky Sullivan reported from Jerusalem and Jaclyn Diaz reported from Washington, D. C.

334,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/19/1206481356/republicans-israel-gop-middle-east-evangelicals-end-times-rapture-christians,"Since the Hamas attack on Israel, Republican presidential candidates have been sniping at each other. The goal: to prove to Republican voters that they support Israel more strongly than their rivals. Former Vice President Mike Pence declared on CNN, ""this is what happens when we have leading voices like Donald Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy and Ron DeSantis signaling retreat from America's role as leader of the free world. ""South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott likewise slammed Ramaswamy for, at one point, saying he hoped the U. S. could eventually reduce aid to Israel. Former President Trump, meanwhile, took aim at Democrats at a recent campaign rally, drawing a direct line between protecting Israel, being an evangelical Christian and voting Republican. ""I can't imagine how anybody who's Jewish or anybody who loves Israel — and frankly, the evangelicals just love Israel — I can't imagine anybody voting Democrat,"" he said bluntly. To be clear, people of both parties widely expressed horror at Hamas's attack on Israel. But there is a divide on public opinion toward the ongoing conflict and the history behind it, with Republicans being particularly pro-Israel. That divide didn't always exist; in the late 1990s, the Pew Research Center found that just over half of Republicans said they sympathize with Israel more than the Palestinians. By 2018, 8 in 10 Republicans said Israel. (Pew has since stopped asking that exact question, but more recent polling still shows a wide partisan gap in attitudes. )And as Trump said, evangelicals are a big part of that shift. Conservative news sources can offer a glimpse of the biblical link between Israel and evangelical Christians. Baptist preacher and Fox News contributor Robert Jeffress recently told the network about what he sees as connections between current war and biblical descriptions of the end times. ""The Bible predicts the final world conflict will happen on the plain of Megiddo in Israel when the superpowers assemble together to do battle,"" he explained. ""Well, I think we can see now how a regional conflict could quickly escalate into a worldwide conflict. And that is going to happen one day. ""Many Christians, particularly Pentecostals and fundamentalists, believe that end times scenario to be real. In addition, many evangelicals believe in what is called the ""Abrahamic Covenant"" — the idea that God promised land that is now Israel and the Palestinian territories to Abraham and his descendants. According to one 2017 survey from Southern Baptist publisher LifeWay, 8 in 10 evangelicals believe that ""God's promise to Abraham and his descendants was for all time,"" and 7 in 10 agreed that ""Jewish people have a historic right to the land of Israel. ""Starting in the 1960s, Christian leaders like Billy Graham began to emphasize — and politicize — this connection. ""Graham first visited Israel in 1960. And it's a really big deal,"" said Daniel Hummel, a research fellow at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Not only did Graham preach in Israel, but he met with then-Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion: ""He really makes a point to articulate a Christian Zionist view that the nation of Israel is a fulfillment of God's plans for the Jewish people and that it has a great future ahead of it,"" explained Hummel. In the 1980s the conservative Christian organization Moral Majority grew more involved in high-level Republican politics. That organization also considered Israel one of its key issues, and founder Rev. Jerry Falwell also had access to Israeli prime ministers. At the same time as all this, the parties continued to sort demographically, with white evangelicals over time shifting to become a massive part of the Republican base — which they still are today. President Trump understood that, and played to evangelical sensibilities when he recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, then moved the U. S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to the the holy city of Jerusalem — which is claimed by both Israel and the Palestinians. In a 2020 campaign speech, Trump was blunt about why he did it:""We moved the capital of Israel to Jerusalem. That's for the evangelicals,"" he said. He added: ""You know, it's amazing with that: the evangelicals are more excited about that than Jewish people. "" (Jewish voters overwhelmingly vote Democratic, and as of 2021, only 4 in 10 U. S. Jews rated Trump's handling of U. S. -Israeli policy as ""excellent"" or ""good. "")All of this said, partisan divides over Israel and the Palestinian territories are about more than religion. For example, U. S. conservative elites may have felt some affinity with similarly conservative Israeli leadership. ""Since [former Prime Minister Menachem] Begin's victory in 1977, Israel has mostly had right of center governments. It does now, until the formation of a national unity government,"" said Elliott Abrams, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who served in three Republican administrations, including Trump's. Moreover, the presence of a strong democracy in the Middle East was part of what made Israel important to neoconservatives, who were ascendant in the Republican Party in the 1970s and beyond. ""Most of them see a very strong strategic alignment between the U. S. and Israel. They're also gaining prominence in the GOP in the 1970s and really displacing any type of paleoconservative or isolationist-type tendency,"" said Hummel, with the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""And so there's a sort of happy alignment of evangelicals becoming interested in this issue and the GOP outside of evangelicals also becoming more accommodating and even in some cases promoting a very strong pro-Israel policy,"" he explained. At the same time some Americans developed an admiration for Israel. ""Israel takes on this much broader meaning in American culture, that it's an effective military, it seems to sort of not have nearly as much internal dissension as the U. S. does, and it's a democracy in a tough neighborhood,"" he added. While partisanship is one huge divide in American opinions on Israel and Palestine, experts also noted a sharp age divide in the U. S. : Young Americans tend to be less pro-Israel than their elders. That age divide includes young Republicans and even young evangelicals. So even though the Republican Party and Israel are intertwined today, it won't necessarily always be that way.",npr_articles/article_334.txt,npr_results/article_334.txt.json
335,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/19/1206976508/biden-israel-trip-oval-office-ukraine-funding,"Twenty four hours into a turbulent trip to the Middle East, President Biden made an extremely rare appearance in the press cabin at the back of Air Force One. He had changed from his dark suit into a light blue casual sweater, and had been working the phones after leaving Tel Aviv. He had news that wouldn't wait until he was back in Washington. ""Look: I came to get something done — I got it done,"" Biden said, describing a ""very blunt negotiation"" he had just concluded with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. El-Sisi had agreed to let some humanitarian aid shipments pass into Gaza through the Rafah gate. It would be just 20 trucks at first, starting maybe by Friday, pending some road repairs, Biden said. It wasn't all that he wanted: he had also hoped to be able to secure passage for Palestinians who wanted to flee Gaza, including Americans. But it was a start. Getting aid into Gaza was one of his chief goals for his high-stakes mission — a trip, he revealed, that his team had debated whether he should make at all. ""Not many people thought I could get this done. And not many people want to be associated with failure,"" he said. Failing to deliver any humanitarian aid would have reflected poorly on his presidency, Biden said — and legitimately so. As the plane hurtled back toward Washington, the White House said Biden would follow up the trip with a second high-stakes moment: a Thursday night prime-time address from the Oval Office. He will try to make the case to Americans — and Congress — for billions in new spending on Israel, as well as Ukraine and possibly Taiwan: other places where Biden says a failure in U. S. leadership is not an option. Since taking office, Biden has pushed to build and strengthen international coalitions, whether to support Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia, or counter China's economic and military might in the Indo-Pacific. In the Middle East, he had hopes to foster better relations between Israel and a number of Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia. But that was scrambled after  brutal attacks by Hamas on Oct. 7 killed more than 1,300 Israelis. Israel has vowed to root out the terrorist group from Gaza, where Palestinian civilians have struggled to get enough food, water and medicine ahead of what could be a bitter ground offensive. Biden wanted to show support for Israel while getting an update on military plans from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet in Tel Aviv. But he also planned to meet in person with three key Arab leaders in Amman afterward. In the hours before Biden flew to the region, a deadly explosion at a Gaza hospital sparked anger across the Middle East — anger at Israel, and the United States. Hundreds of Palestinian civilians were killed. It wasn't until Air Force One began to taxi that a White House official told reporters that the Amman stop was off. The Palestinians blamed Israel for the explosion — and Israel said it absolutely wasn't them. Biden told his staff to find out more. By the time Biden landed in Tel Aviv, protests were breaking out around the Arab world. There was no red carpet and none of the usual ceremony. This was a time of war. Netanyahu was there waiting for Biden when he stepped off the plane. Biden greeted him warmly, and went in for a hug. Sitting beside the prime minister at a hotel in downtown Tel Aviv — in an underground ballroom fortified to do double duty as a bunker — Biden said he agreed with the Israeli assessment of the source of the deadly blast. ""Based on what I've seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, and not you,"" Biden said. He had seen U. S. military intelligence convincing him a Palestinian militant group had misfired a rocket. On other Gaza issues — Biden had some tough love to deliver to Netanyahu and his cabinet. But the prime minister praised him for the message his presence sent to the world. ""For the people of Israel, there's only one thing better than having a true friend like you standing with Israel — and that is having you standing in Israel.  Your visit here is the first visit of an American president in Israel at a time of war.  It is deeply, deeply moving,"" Netanyahu said. Being there for Israel, bearing witness to its darkest hour was important to Biden. He met with people who witnessed the brutal violence. Biden said the pain — the rage — in Israel is justified, after what the nation had gone through. ""But I caution you while you feel that rage, don't be consumed by it. After 9/11 we were at rage in the United States, while we sought justice and got justice, we  also made mistakes,"" he said. Innocent Palestinians are suffering too, he said. The rules of war must be followed even as Israel aims to destroy the group that wreaked so much terror, Hamas. ""It's what they should do,"" Biden said. ""My point to everyone is, look: if you have an opportunity to alleviate the pain, you should do it, period. And if you don't, you're gonna lose credibility worldwide.

President Biden got off Air Force One during his high-stakes trip to the Middle East Wednesday and greeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a big hug. The message was clear — the United States stands with Israel. Biden took that message to the American people Thursday night in an Oval Office address, but also tried to balance that with empathy for Palestinians. ""In Israel, I saw people who are strong, determined, resilient and also angry, in shock and in deep, deep pain,"" Biden said. But he noted that Palestinians also have the ""right to dignity and to self-determination. ""He added, ""The actions of Hamas terrorists don't take that right away. . . . We mourn every innocent life lost. We can't ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians who only want to live in peace and have an opportunity. ""Biden also sought to appeal to Americans' better angels here at home, especially in the wake of the murder of a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy in Illinois. ""We must, without equivocation, denounce anti-Semitism,"" Biden said. ""We must also, without equivocation, denounce Islamophobia. ""It's a fine line that Biden is trying to walk — showing support for Israel and wanting to maintain influence there, looking strong enough domestically for an audience that is questioning his age and facility, and keeping his reliable voting base intact and energized ahead of his reelection bid next year. Biden was also, however, trying to refocus Americans on the war in Ukraine, which has been largely out of American news since the latest Mideast violence. ""I know these conflicts can seem far away,"" Biden said Thursday night. ""It's natural to ask, why does this matter to America?"" Biden went on to make the case for staying engaged on both fronts, arguing that ""making sure Israel and Ukraine succeed is vital for America's national security. ""Biden is looking to procure significant funding for both conflicts. He needs to go through Congress, which holds the power of the purse, but that's made more difficult by the fact that the U. S. House is currently non funziona. Republicans on Capitol Hill are mired in a mess of their own creation, having failed repeatedly over the last two weeks to pick a speaker after ousting Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. , from the post. That leaves the country unable to respond to, well, pretty much anything in a strong and substantive way, including Biden's foreign-policy priorities. And he doesn't have the political wind at his back. Biden is left in a difficult and politically risky position — and the risk crosses political lines. He's not benefiting in the polls from his strong, pro-Israeli stance despite Americans saying they want that. Republicans are looking to pounce on any misstep. And, the longer Israel's campaign on Gaza marches on and civilian deaths mount, the more pressure Biden will likely face from many in the world — and even in some quarters within his own party — to lean on Israel to pull back. After the hospital explosion in Gaza Tuesday, for example, divides were being exposed on the left. Biden took a forceful, pro-Israeli position in its war with Hamas immediately after the group's killing spree in southern Israel Oct. 7, the deadliest single day for Jews since the Holocaust. ""In this moment, we must be crystal clear,"" Biden said after the attack. ""We stand with Israel. We stand with Israel. ""And he did so again during his trip to Israel Wednesday. Invoking the Holocaust, Biden said, ""The world watched then — it knew — and the world did nothing. We will not stand by and do nothing again — not today, not tomorrow, not ever. ""In backing Israel, Biden is taking a familiar — and popular — stance. It's one long-held by political leaders in both parties, because Israel is the U. S. 's strongest ally in the Middle East. But that long-held sentiment appears to be changing. Ahead of his reelection bid next year, Biden has to balance his own world view — one that is in line with that deeply ingrained American, pro-Israeli position — and that of younger voters and voters of color, who don't share the same depth of support for Israel. For the first time this year, Gallup found this year that Democrats' sympathies lie more with Palestinians than Israelis. And that is driven by young voters. The latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll reflects that. Despite two-thirds of respondents in the survey saying they want a public show of support for Israel, those younger than 45, were 30 points less likely to say they wanted that than respondents 45 or older. Non-whites were 20 points less likely than whites to say so as well. That is something Biden's campaign is likely sensitive to, especially considering Biden has never been a favorite of the young, progressive left. Cracks started showing in the aftermath of the Gaza hospital explosion. Before the United States weighed in, Democrats Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota — the first two Muslim women elected to Congress — joined a pro-Palestinian chorus blaming Israel. ""Israel just bombed the Baptist Hospital killing 500 Palestinians (doctors, children, patients) just like that,"" Tlaib tweeted. She called for a ceasefire and in comments directed at Biden, labeled this ""your war. """"Bombing a hospital is among the gravest of war crimes,"" Omar tweeted. ""The IDF reportedly blowing up one of the few places the injured and wounded can seek medical treatment and shelter during a war is horrific. ""After the U. S. intelligence assessment, Omar called for ""an independent investigation to determine conclusively who is responsible for this war crime. ""Israel blamed the terror group Islamic Jihad, saying it was an errant rocket fired from Gaza. During his stop in Israel, Biden concurred. The National Security Council said, in part, ""Our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion. ""A bipartisan statement from the Senate Intelligence Committee also said after reviewing available intelligence, it feels ""confident that the explosion was the result of a failed rocket launch by militant terrorists. ""The U. S. did not release evidence beyond the statements. But a lot of damage had already been done. People weren't waiting for confirmations, and protests erupted in countries like Jordan, where Biden was originally supposed to meet with Jordanian, Egyptian and Palestinian leaders. That summit was canceled as a result of the hospital explosion and the hundreds who were killed there. Tlaib, who is Palestinian American, didn't walk back her remarks. ""As an American, not just as a member of the United States Congress, I am ashamed,"" she said, per ABC News. ""I am ashamed that they're saying, 'not yet. Maybe next week. ' . . . How many more have to die?""She added, ""To my president, to our president . . . I want him to know, as a Palestinian American and somebody in Muslim faith, I'm not going to forget this. And I think a lot of people are not going to forget this. ""Many Democrats, even fellow progressives, pushed back on their colleagues — and don't want any equivocation. ""It's truly disturbing that Members of Congress rushed to blame Israel for the hospital tragedy in Gaza,"" Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, for example, tweeted. ""Who would take the word of a group that just massacred innocent Israeli civilians over our key ally?""He added, ""Now is not the time to talk about a ceasefire. . . . Hamas does not want peace, they want to destroy Israel. We can talk about a ceasefire after Hamas is neutralized. ""When anything happens in the world, especially something of this magnitude, the president is expected to respond, to take a position, to show leadership. A president has to often balance his own world view with domestic politics. In this case, at least initially, both appeared to be in line with each other. Two-thirds of respondents in the NPR poll — taken days after Hamas' attack and after Biden's initial remarks — said the United States should publicly support Israel. And yet Biden didn't appear to get any benefit politically — 52% in the survey said they disapproved of his handling of the Israel-Hamas situation. If that's a head-scratcher, consider that in the same poll, an equal number also disapproved of the job Biden is doing overall. So, it's pretty clear that partisan armor is just incredibly difficult to pierce in this intense age of hyperpolarization. Is it really possible, though, that the most volatile issue on the planet right now might have zero effect on electoral politics?It's certainly possible, if not likely. Partisanship is entrenched, and foreign policy often ranks very low on the list of priorities for voters — despite it being one of the areas a president has the most control over. As is often the case with the politics of foreign policy, there is little upside and lots of risk. Certainly, if Biden stumbles, freezes or can't clearly articulate his position, conservatives will pounce and Democrats will lose confidence. But the reality is, Biden isn't likely consumed with the domestic politics of this. Before serving as president, he spent a good portion of his life — as a Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman and vice president — intimately involved in the U. S. 's role in the world. Many in this country have taken a turn inward after two decades of war and become weary of U. S. involvement in international conflicts. Biden acknowledged that Americans relate to the pain Israel is facing. Still, he had some potential lessons from the U. S. response to 9/11 Wednesday. ""I understand,"" Biden said Wednesday. ""Many Americans understand. You can't look at what has happened here and not scream out for justice, but I caution this — while you feel that rage, don't be consumed by it. After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States, and while we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes. ""It was quite the admission for a U. S. president. But it's also the kind of subtle warning Biden can only deliver if he maintains influence — and part of that is keeping Netanyahu in a close embrace.",npr_articles/article_336.txt,npr_results/article_336.txt.json

C. In Amman, Jordan, more than a thousand people marched toward the Israeli Embassy in the hours after news spread of an explosion at a hospital in Gaza. Security forces tear-gassed people trying to reach the building and riot police managed to push back crowds away from the embassy. Videos posted online show hundreds of people gathering not far from the U. S. Embassy in Beirut in the second day of demonstrations on Wednesday. Protesters reportedly clashed with police there as well, took down a security wall and cut a fence on the road heading to the embassy. The anger was sparked after the blast at the Al Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza on Tuesday where hundreds were killed in the explosion. Many called for the end of the attacks on Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Others expressed anger at what they see is the world turning its back on the Palestinian people. The raw emotion felt by many hitting the streets in protest in the Middle East, including in Egypt, Morocco and Iran, underscores the spreading tension in the region from the Israel-Hamas conflict. The U. S. embassy in Beirut issued a warning Wednesday telling U. S. citizens there to avoid the Awkar area ""given the potential for further demonstrations. "" The embassy remained open but the State Department updated its travel advisory for Lebanon to a Level 4: Do Not Travel. ""The Department of State urges U. S. citizens in Lebanon to make plans to depart as soon as possible while commercial options are still available,"" the agency said. The clashes continued late Wednesday as President Joe Biden met with Israeli leaders in Tel Aviv. He expressed support for Israel and doubled down on the assertion that the explosion at the hospital was the result of a Palestinian militant group and not an Israel attack. Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls Gaza, and other Arab countries placed the blame on Israel. Palestinian officials announced a strike on Wednesday in the West Bank in response to the Gaza hospital tragedy. Many stores and businesses were closed as part of this demonstration. In many neighborhoods in the West Bank, including Ramallah, Nablus and Hebron, Palestinians took to the streets. Some reportedly threw rocks at Israeli security in the West Bank. Reuters reported that Israeli forces shot two Palestinian teens dead near Ramallah during those protests. In Washington, organizers had scheduled Wednesday's rally before the blast at the hospital occurred, taking aim at Israel's overall policies in Gaza. An estimated 300 people were arrested during a protest in the Capitol, the U. S. Capitol Police told NPR, and three were charged with assaulting police officers. American Jewish organizations gathered at the Capitol on Wednesday to criticize the Israeli government's overall policies on Gaza. Protesters demanded an immediate cease-fire of the current violence. The organizations Jewish Voice for Peace and If Not Now marched in the streets calling for the end of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza. They entered the Capitol building late in the afternoon and continued to hold demonstrations in the Cannon House Office Building until police started to make arrests. While arrested protesters were being led out of the building – their hands bound by zipties and Capitol police collecting their belongings in plastic bags – they were met with chants of support. The Capitol Police said Wednesday night that the number of people arrested could change by Thursday once everyone has been processed. One of the attendees at the Washington protest identified himself as Matthew Hoh, who said he is a member of Veterans for Peace. Hoh said he from North Carolina to attend the rally. He said he was in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and he now regrets his involvement. ""For people to say that this (the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in Israel) is another 9/11 and then not to say, 'My God, what have we learned? What will we do? What will come from that?' After everything that we did following 9/11, and the regret and shame that so many of us carry from that,"" Hoh said. ""If we don't take a stand against it, then when we look back on this and ask how it happened, we will have only ourselves to blame. """,npr_articles/article_337.txt,npr_results/article_337.txt.json
338,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/18/1206795861/heres-the-available-evidence-of-what-happened-at-al-ahli-arab-hospital-in-gaza,"Video and photographic evidence, along with eyewitness accounts, are providing some clues about Tuesday's massive explosion at Gaza's Al Ahli Arab Hospital, which Palestinian officials say killed hundreds. Hamas blames an Israeli airstrike for the blast, a charge the Israeli Defense Forces have vigorously denied. Israel says that a Palestinian rocket, launched by a Palestinian militant group called Islamic Jihad, exploded in mid-air and fell on the hospital grounds. The U. S. believes Israel is not to blame, based on analysis of ""overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information,"" a National Security Council spokesperson said Wednesday. Social media is awash with claims and counterclaims of who was behind the explosion, according to Kolina Koltai, a researcher with the open source investigations group Bellingcat. ""Immediately it just became a very confusing situation,"" she says. ""You have conflicting claims, all this footage. ""Here is what the available evidence shows so far. There were hundreds of people, including families, who had come to the hospital to hide from the bombardment elsewhere in Gaza, according to Dr. Fadil Naim, the head of the orthopedics department, who was working at the time of the blast. The hospital, Gaza's oldest, is run by a Christian group. Israel has conducted thousands of air strikes on Gaza in the twelve days since a wave of attacks by Hamas militants killed more than a thousand Israelis. Church officials and the Palestinian Ministry of Health say that Israeli fire had previously struck the hospital on Oct. 14. Despite that incident, because the hospital belonged to the church, civilians ""thought the hospital was the most safe place in Gaza,"" Naim told NPR. The displaced Palestinians were in a courtyard outside the hospital at the time of the blast. The small courtyard had several parked cars and a few grassy patches where people appear to have congregated. Sometime in the evening local time, several videos appear to have captured a massive explosion and fireball at the hospital. Several experts in geolocation have shown that the videos show the blast occurring at the hospital and NPR independently was able to verify those geolocations.  One video, a live broadcast feed from the news channel Al Jazeera, appears to show what could be a rocket launching from a site west of the hospital. The rocket, or other object, appears to break apart high above the hospital moments before the blast. The Israel Defense Forces claim that radar data shows a barrage of rockets was launched from an area southwest of the hospital at the time the explosion occurred. While the geometry of the Al Jazeera video aligns with that claim, there is no way to independently confirm the radar data. Dr. Naim was in the hospital's operating room the moment the explosion occurred, he told NPR. Upon hearing the blast, he rushed outside to find horrific injuries to the people in the courtyard, including amputated limbs and vascular injuries, he said. ""Some of them died in our hands,"" he said. Notably, Naim also said that there were no deaths among the hospital's staff, many of whom were working inside at the time of the explosion. ""Luckily none of our staff was killed, but we had two injured,"" he says. Photos from the following day also appear to show little damage to the hospital buildings, and a relatively small blast zone from the explosion. That damage pattern is inconsistent with a large air-dropped bomb, which would leave a crater and create a shockwave that would damage or destroy surrounding structures, says Marc Garlasco, a former targeting officer for the U. S. military who now works for PAX, a Netherlands-based non-profit. ""It's very clear to me that this is not an airstrike,"" Garlasco says. Israeli bombs typically leave craters three to ten meters in size, and are designed to create a large shockwave that propels shrapnel over a large area. The lack of both shrapnel damage and structural damage to the hospital is inconsistent with all types of commonly used Israeli bombs and artillery shells, he says. Death estimates vary widely, but are believed to be in the hundreds.  Garlasco, who has investigated war crimes all over the world, says such a high death toll would be toward the ""extreme high end of anything I've ever seen. "" But he found it plausible, he said, given that so many Palestinian civilians have left their homes to seek refuge in a small number of supposedly safe locations. ""It really speaks to the issue of Palestinians being packed into areas they believe are safe,"" he says.",npr_articles/article_338.txt,npr_results/article_338.txt.json
339,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/18/1206506717/israel-hamas-gaza-dna-bodies-burial-tel-aviv,"Warning, this story contains descriptions of atrocities committed against civilians. TEL AVIV, Israel — On an army base south of Tel Aviv, the sun is sinking behind low clouds as the smell of eucalyptus fills the air. A man in uniform wearing a kippah is heading towards the place where remains of people killed in the massacre by the militant group Hamas on October 7 have been brought for identification. ""I ask you to respect this place. I ask you to respect the dead,"" says a member of the Israel Defense Forces, Lehi, who is only authorized to give her first name. She says she wants people from all over the world to see something that medical examiners, doctors and rabbis have been bearing witness to over the last week.   ""We as a people can't remain silent for something like this,"" Colonel Chaim Weissberg, the head rabbi of the IDF for nearly 20 years, says through a translator. Usually when a Jew dies, a family member says a prayer called the mourner's kaddish for the dead. ""The regular way would be for a child to say kaddish, this prayer, for his parents,"" Rabbi Weissberg says. ""But here we have entire families that no one's going to be able to say kaddish for them. ""More than 1,000 bodies have been brought here. Truck after truck full of human remains of those murdered when Hamas stormed across the border from Gaza. Rabbi Weissberg breaks down as he describes in detail the condition some of the bodies arrived in. ""Young girls, elderly women, raped . . . Soldiers and citizens whose heads were chopped off,"" he says. Many of the people identifying and caring for the dead are military reservists. They have day jobs as civilians, but since the attack, they have been here — like a dentist named Maayan. She identifies people's remains by their dental imprints. ""Next to the identification place there is a family room to say goodbye to their loved ones, to say their last goodbye,"" she says. ""So while identifying, we can hear the screams and we can hear the cries of a woman burying her child, of a child losing his parents and [becoming an] orphan. """"And we hear the cry and we hear the screams, and we still identify tirelessly, uncompromisingly, to give the fallen their last respect that nobody gave them. ""In another part of the army base there is a brightly-lit white tent where soldiers are identifying people. It's difficult, and the details are brutal. A soldier is handing out masks to help protect against the smell. People at the base have been working nonstop since the massacre began, and there are still bodies that haven't been identified. Rabbi Weissberg says they have three ways of identifying people. One is a loved one visually recognizing the person. Another is dental records. And a third is DNA identification. He says that in too many instances, DNA has had to be used because the body has been so badly mutilated — even in the case of children. There are about a dozen refrigerated shipping containers, standing side by side. Men in white coveralls open four of them and inside are body bags stacked four high. Some of the body bags are very, very small. As a light rain starts to fall, a TV cameraman suddenly hunches over, sobbing. Nearby is a small covered picnic table — the smokers' corner — where a woman named Avigayil is sitting in the dark. Like others, the IDF only authorized her to give her first name. In Judaism, as in many religious traditions, there are rules for how a body is supposed to be treated before burial. For many years, Avigayil has done that preparation for burial as a reservist for the army. ""There's a concept of respect for the dead,"" she says. ""It's treating every dead person with the dignity and respect that we'd want, the same as we'd want when we're living. ""   ""Any part that was part of the human being, we bring it to burial with the body. So if there are ashes we are very careful not to lose any of the ashes. If there's skin that was torn away, certainly if there's blood, if there's flesh, we collect everything so that it's all buried with the body. ""Avigayil says she has felt very little in the last week. Blocking out feelings was the only way to do the work that needed to be done. But in the last day, as the work has started to slow down just a little, it's starting to catch up with her. She says she's beginning to feel the exhaustion, both physical and mental. ""We have some psychiatrists and social workers that are talking to us after shifts, but I think it's starting to build up,"" she says. Avigayil has done this work in the army for years and has seen many people killed before. But she says this is different in two ways. ""The numbers are mind boggling . . . I can't wrap my head around it,"" she says. ""I go through the lists again and I can't believe that I can't remember from two days ago what exactly — was she the one in her cute pajamas? Or was she the one that was, I don't know what. """"And the other is it's never felt this cruel. We're seeing bodies that were mutilated after they were already dead. It's harder to wrap my head around it. ""Avigayil says it had fundamentally changed her view of the world. ""For years growing up I thought the world was improving,"" she says. ""As a human being, as a woman, I felt like things were progressing in the right direction. I can't think that anymore, and that's shattering.

340,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/18/1206565510/republican-president-election-israel-hamas-trump-haley-biden,"It's the day of President Biden's trip to Israel — his strongest show of support for the country yet in its war against Hamas. ""We'll make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of itself,"" Biden said last week. The trip, which comes as Israel prepares for a ground counterattack in Gaza, will give Biden the chance to meet with Israeli leaders and discuss growing humanitarian concerns in Gaza. Since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, more than 1,400 Israelis and at least 3,000 Palestinians have died because of the conflict. Officials in Gaza say nearly two-thirds of Palestinians killed are children, and that the toll on the Palestinian side is likely to increase after an explosion hit a hospital in Gaza Tuesday. Republicans seeking Biden's office are closely watching his steps, as his approach to the war gives them a chance to contrast with the president, who's running for re-election, on an issue that is key to GOP foreign policy. While people in both political parties have decried the attacks as horrific, the war has revealed a deep split among Republican presidential hopefuls in particular as they disagree over whether the U. S. should practice isolationism in its foreign affairs, or take on a more interventionist approach. Here's where the candidates stand:In a recent speech to his supporters, the former president criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for not being ""prepared"" for the attack. He then separately complimented Hezbollah, the anti-Israel militant and political organization that operates to Israel's north in Lebanon, calling it ""very smart"" for its intelligence capabilities. Several in his party have criticized him over those comments: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called his statements ""absurd,"" and his former second in command, former Vice President Mike Pence, described them as ""reckless and irresponsible. "" But in later remarks, Trump clarified that he stands with Israel. He also said he favors continuing a freeze on refugees from entering the U. S. , which would include those coming from Gaza. Trump bristled at the idea of admitting Palestinian refugees and said he'd also ban those who support Hamas, or are a ""communist, Marxist or fascist,"" from entering. ""If you want to abolish the state of Israel, you're disqualified,"" he said. DeSantis, a distant runner-up to Trump in national polling, said Israel should use ""overwhelming force"" so that ""Hamas terrorist infrastructure and networks are eradicated from the Earth. ""But as for U. S. involvement, DeSantis said he only favors supplementary aid for Israel, and opposes deploying troops to the Middle East. DeSantis argued that the U. S. should not accept Palestinians fleeing the region as refugees. ""If you look at how they behave — not all of them are Hamas, but they are all antisemitic, "" he said. ""None of them believe in Israel's right to exist. None of the Arab states are willing to take any of them,"" he told voters in Iowa. While speaking with one voter in New Hampshire about the conflict, DeSantis said, ""Why aren't these Arab countries willing to absorb some of the Palestinian Arabs?""After the voter, who said he is Arab American, exchanged more conversation with DeSantis, he told the candidate, ""You had my vote, but you don't now. ""Haley made it her mission while she was Trump's ambassador to the United Nations to staunchly defend Israel. She said the U. S. must stand with Israel as they ""finish"" Hamas. She's also criticized DeSantis for claiming that all Palestinians are antisemitic. ""There are so many of these people who want to be free from this terrorist rule,"" she said in an interview with CNN's ""State of the Union. "" ""They want to be free from all of that,"" she said. ""And America has always been sympathetic to the fact that you can separate civilians from terrorists. ""Some joked that Haley was a second ambassador for Israel during her tenure at the U. N. She stopped the appointment of a Palestinian envoy, and claimed that she helped cut out language from a U. S. report that said Israel's treatment of Palestinians is ""apartheid. "" When Israeli forces killed more than 50 Palestinians in 2018, Haley defended the country and even walked out of a Security Council meeting when a permanent observer of the Palestinian territories to the U. N. began speaking about those killings in Gaza. In August, she fought back against competitor Vivek Ramaswamy when he suggested the U. S. gradually reduce its military aid to Israel. Since 2009, the U. S. has given Israel $3. 4 billion in missile defense funding, which includes $1. 3 billion just for the Iron Dome, its air-defense system, since 2011. One of the last steps she took as ambassador before she stepped down in 2018 was to prompt a U. N. vote that, if passed, would have condemned actions by Hamas, though that vote failed. In an interview with Fox News, the former vice president said Israel has ""no choice but to crush Hamas. """"We will stand with Israel when this ground assault begins, and we will stand with Israel every day through the hard fighting and loss that will occur until they achieve an outright victory,"" Pence said. Pence placed blame on the Bush administration for turning Gaza ""over to Hamas"" and called that policy of ""containment"" a ""catastrophic failure. "" He also criticized the Biden administration's position on Iran and claimed it laid the groundwork for Hamas's attack on Israel. Pence said that if he were president, he would tell leaders in Egypt to accept Palestinian refugees: ""Send us the bill. We'll set up the refugee camps,"" he told Fox News. He also said he would direct U. S. forces into the Mediterranean as a message to Hamas allies Hezbollah, and those in Syria and Iran that ""all of them are to stand down. "" He also said U. S. special forces should go into the region to rescue American hostages. The entrepreneur is one of the loudest advocates in the field for American isolationism in foreign policy. He's extended that stance to Israel, saying that the U. S. should phase out aid for Israel. While Ramaswamy condemned what he called a ""barbaric"" and ""medieval"" attack from Hamas, he said the U. S. should avoid a ""knee-jerk response"" and take a ""cool-headed"" approach in Gaza so that the war doesn't grow into a larger conflict in the Middle East. ""We do support Israel,"" Ramaswamy said. ""Israel needs to define its objectives before we know what that support even entails. But I do think it's going to take somebody who gets to the facts rather than just the emotional hysteria that we're seeing from some of the other candidates. ""The former New Jersey governor alleged on X that Biden's strategy of so-called appeasement ""invited"" the attack on Israel. ""Under my presidency, America will restore the deterrence Biden has foolishly given away,"" he said. In an interview, Christie blasted Trump for praising Hezbollah. ""Only a fool would give comments that could give aid and comfort to Israel's adversary in this situation,"" Christie said. The South Carolina senator has stressed the long-term alliance between the U. S. and Israel, and supported Netanyahu's ""restraint"" in the war thus far. ""Americans should stand shoulder-to-shoulder, back-to-back, with no daylight with Israel,"" Scott said of the Israel-Hamas war. Scott said he believes the U. S. should bring military capacities into the region so that they can ""be responsive"" if the conflict grows. He, like Pence, added that special forces should be ready to rescue American hostages. In a statement last week, Burgum called the Hamas attack ""reprehensible. "" The governor of North Dakota was one of 20 governors, including DeSantis, who wrote a letter to the White House expressing support for Israel, while denouncing what they claim is the Biden administration's ""appeasement-first foreign policy. ""The letter claims that Biden's response has empowered Iran and allowed ""state-sponsors of terror"" to attack Israel. Burgum expanded on these claims during an event at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank. ""Hamas is a proxy of Iran,"" he said. ""This is Iran's war on Israel and it's a war on America. ""Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security advisor, said the U. S. can't confirm at the moment if Iran knew about the attack beforehand or if it helped Hamas plan it.

341,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/18/1206702426/biden-arrives-in-israel-as-gaza-reels-from-deadly-hospital-explosion,"President Biden's rare wartime visit to Israel on Wednesday marked his most forceful public show of support for the country, pledging unwavering commitment to its security and a promise for a congressional request for more defense funding, while simultaneously cautioning Israelis not to be consumed by rage. Biden's visit appeared to yield some gains for the besieged Palestinians: Israel said it would allow food, water and medicine to reach the civilian population in the southern portion of the Gaza Strip. The president's comments came amid concerns across the region that the volatility could spread to other Mideast countries as protests erupt in Iran, Jordan, Turkey, Morocco, Lebanon and Tunisia against Israel's bombardment and siege of Gaza. Following the visit, the White House announced that Biden plans to deliver an Oval Office address on the Hamas attacks in Israel and Ukraine's fight against the Russian invasion on Thursday. In a speech concluding the whirlwind trip, Biden slammed Hamas saying its attack on Israelis on Oct. 7 was similar to past terrorist attacks on the U. S. Still, the president, who noted that the ""vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas,"" urged Israel not to let ""shock, pain, rage"" drive its quest for justice, advocating for a two-state solution to the conflict. ""You can't look at what has happened here . . . and not scream out for justice,"" he said. ""But I caution this: While you feel that rage, don't be consumed by it,"" he warned. ""After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. And while we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes. ""The president's visit did not halt the violence in Israel or Gaza. Throughout the day Israel continued to launch airstrikes on Gaza, even as Biden met with grieving Israeli families from the Oct. 7 attacks that sparked the latest war. Hamas, meanwhile, did not cease its launch of rockets at Israeli cities. Israel's Iron Dome defense system intercepts most. Air raid sirens are frequently heard in cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Biden's visit also yielded a conditional deal for humanitarian aid to besieged Palestinians who say they are slowly dying of thirst and are without medicine, electricity or enough food following a complete Israeli siege of Gaza.  On his way back to Washington, Biden told reporters that Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi has agreed to open up the Rafah gate — the border crossing along the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt — to allow up to 20 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza. ""They're gonna patch the roads, they have to fill in potholes to get these trucks through. And that's gonna occur,"" Biden said, noting it might take until Friday for the shipments to happen. He added that the first movement would be a small portion of the aid amassed at the border. The U. N. will distribute the material in Gaza, he said. Biden told reporters that a key goal for his trip had been to get aid into Gaza as well as passage out for Americans wanting to leave — something he said he hopes will happen. Earlier in the day, the Israeli government said it would allow only food, water and medicine to reach the civilian population in southern Gaza — not in the north were Palestinians have been ordered to evacuate. It did not indicate whether fuel would be allowed in to power hospital generators and Gaza's main power plant, which shut down last week. Both Biden and the Israeli government said that if any aid reaches Hamas, the flow of aid into Gaza will be stopped. Egypt has been trying to channel humanitarian relief to Gaza through the Rafah crossing, but aid has been piling up on the Egyptian side after Israeli bombardments made the crossing inoperable. Looming over the trip is worldwide outrage over a catastrophic explosion at a hospital in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday that killed hundreds of people, including scores of children. Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City, where Israel's military had ordered a complete evacuation of its residents, was being used as a shelter by displaced families with nowhere else to go. Grim images depicting children's bodies and bloodied, limbless women and men spread across social media and Arabic satellite TV channels, sparking protests across the Middle East from Morocco to Iran, and even within the U. S. Capitol on Wednesday. Israel and the Palestinians have traded blame for the blast; Hamas claims it was a deliberate Israeli airstrike, a charge the Israeli military has vehemently denied. Israel says that a Palestinian rocket, launched by a Palestinian militant group, exploded in mid-air and fell on the hospital grounds.  Shortly after arriving in Tel Aviv, Biden told Prime Minister Netanyahu that it appears as though the strike against the hospital ""was done by the other team, not by you. "" When was asked by reporters what made him confident in accepting Israel's explanation that it was not behind the hospital explosion. He replied: ""The data I was shown by my defense department. ""Hours later, a National Security Council spokesperson reiterated that the U. S. believes Israel is not to blame, based on analysis of ""overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information. ""Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group in Gaza say the attack was carried out by an Israeli warplane. Arab governments, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE also blame Israel. The blast and the protests it has sparked mark a dramatic turn in the 12-daylong war that began when Hamas fighters from the Gaza Strip broke through its barrier with Israel and killed 1,400 people in Israel and took some 200 people hostage. Entire Israeli communities in the south were destroyed in the assault. Since those attacks, nearly 3,500 people in Gaza, a third of them children, have been killed by Israeli bombardment, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. More than 12,000 people have been wounded. Those casualty figures do not include the victims of the Al Ahli hospital blast. Another 1,300 people across Gaza are missing, presumed dead or still alive under the rubble of thousands of homes that have been destroyed. Meanwhile, Israel has called up hundreds of thousands of reservists, who are now poised at its border with Gaza for a possible ground offensive. The Biden administration has been attempting to prevent the violence from spreading to the other parts of the region, but a meeting that was scheduled in Jordan with Biden and the leaders of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority was cancelled by Arab leaders almost immediately after the carnage at the hospital. The summit was meant to focus on efforts to get humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza, and safe passage out for Americans in the conflict zone. The White House said the president looks ""forward to consulting in person with these leaders soon, and agreed to remain regularly and directly engaged with each of them over the coming days. ""Hamas has seized on the devastation caused by the explosion at the hospital calling on Muslims and Arabs across the world to rally against Israel. It said the massacre ""exposes the American and Western support for this criminal occupation. "" Demonstrations have erupted across the Mideast, including in Egypt, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon. There were also large protests in Turkey and Iran. Across the region and in the West, protesters are calling for the end of the attacks on Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. In many neighborhoods in the West Bank, including Ramallah, Nablus and Hebron, Palestinians took to the streets. Some reportedly threw rocks at Israeli security in the West Bank. Reuters reported that Israeli forces shot two Palestinian teens dead near Ramallah during those protests. The U. S. embassy in Beirut issued a warning Wednesday telling U. S. citizens there to avoid the Awkar area ""given the potential for further demonstrations. "" The embassy remained open but the State Department updated its travel advisory for Lebanon to a Level 4: Do Not Travel. ""The Department of State urges U. S. citizens in Lebanon to make plans to depart as soon as possible while commercial options are still available,"" the agency said. In Washington, American Jewish organizations and protesters gathered at the Capitol on Wednesday criticizing the Israeli government and demanding a ceasefire. An estimated 300 people were arrested during a demonstration in the Capitol's rotunda, the U. S. Capitol Police told NPR, and three were charged with assaulting police officers. Reports emerged that Israel's ambassador to Egypt was leaving the country as tensions spike. When Israel's foreign ministry was asked about this, an official simply replied with ""no comment"". Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said Wednesday that any notion or idea that Palestinians in the Gaza Strip could be pushed or relocated to Egyptian territory is dangerous. ""The whole idea is that moving Palestinians to Sinai is simply moving the idea of resistance, the idea of killing, to Sinai,"" he said. ""And then Sinai becomes a base for operations against Israel. ""He said this could quickly spiral and pull Egypt and Israel into conflict. Any attempt to displace Palestinians in the Gaza Strip could also lead to Palestinians in the West Bank being pushed into Jordan, el-Sissi said in opening remarks for a joint press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Cairo on Wednesday. El-Sissi said if that happens, the creation of a Palestinian state wouldn't be possible because there would be land but no people. ""I warn against this scenario,"" he said. In Gaza City, which falls under Israel's evacuation notice, many people simply cannot leave or refuse to, citing the lack of safety anywhere in Gaza. Medical student Tasneen Ahl's home in Gaza City has already been destroyed in this war. She and dozens of family members, including 10 children, remain the city, though. She says her family isn't leaving because hundreds of people have been killed in the south after evacuating there. A U. N. shelter where thousands of Palestinians were seeking refuge was also struck by Israel on Tuesday, killing six people, according to the U. N. agency for Palestinian refugees. ""There's no place here in Gaza we can go. We can't. We can't leave our home,"" Ahl told NPR. The U. N. relief works agency, OCHA, says every person in Gaza is estimated to have less than a gallon of water for all their needs per day, including for drinking, hygiene and cooking. That's in part because water and sanitation facilities have been severely damaged. Ahl says the last time she drank a sip of water was over 24 hours ago. Ahl says her father walked over a mile to source flour for bread. The family is cooking on woodfire because of power outages. ""I can't see my family like this. We are dying slowly,"" she said, before adding the are ""no human rights"" for people in Gaza. NPR staffers Aya Batrawy reported from Jerusalem, Bill Chappell reported from Washington, D.

343,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/18/1206504384/what-you-need-to-know-about-bidens-wartime-trip-to-israel,"For updates on President Biden's visit, follow NPR's live blog. President Biden is meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on Wednesday as the White House shows solidarity with its chief ally in the Middle East after Hamas killed some 1,400 Israelis during an Oct. 7 attack. But the trip became more fraught after an explosion at a busy Gaza hospital killed hundreds of people, shortly before Biden left Washington. Biden had initially planned to stop in Amman, Jordan after Tel Aviv to meet with three key leaders about humanitarian aid for Gaza. But that part of the trip was called off. Here's what you should know about Biden's visit. Biden has been originally scheduled to carry on to Amman after Tel Aviv to meet with Jordan's King Abdullah, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. The purpose was to discuss efforts to get humanitarian aid into Gaza — something that has become a growing concern as the territory runs out of food, water and medical supplies. Civilians — including American citizens in Gaza — have been unable to leave through the Rafah crossing into Egypt. But then an explosion at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds of people. Palestinian authorities accused Israel, while Israel said a Palestinian militant group was responsible. Abbas cancelled his meeting with Biden, and called for three days of mourning. Biden said he would postpone the visit after he talked to King Abdullah. Sitting beside Netanyahu in Tel Aviv, Biden said he was ""deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion. """"Based on what I've seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team — not you — but there's a lot of people out there not sure, so we've got to overcome a lot of things,"" Biden said. Biden has taken a strong pro-Israel stance after the Hamas attacks, saying that it was the most deadly attack on Jewish people since the Holocaust, and that Israel has a right to defend itself. Kirby said 31 U. S. citizens were among the dead and 13 Americans remain unaccounted for. Biden wants to get an update from Israeli military officials on their strategy and the pace of their operations when he meets with Netanyahu and his war cabinet, Kirby said. The trip comes as Israel prepares for a ground offensive in Gaza, and Biden wants to learn more about the objectives and plans for coming days and weeks, Kirby said. ""He'll be asking some tough questions - he'll be asking them as a friend, as a true friend of Israel but he'll be asking some questions of them,"" Kirby said. At the same time, Biden has pledged support for Israel in its war against Hamas, and is expected to ask Congress later this week to provide funding for additional military aid to Israel. Biden also hopes to get more information about efforts to locate and free hostages taken during the attacks, a handful of whom are believed to be American citizens. Biden will meet with people who lost loved ones during the attacks, as well as first responders, Kirby said. Biden's team has been pressing Israel and Egypt to allow food, water and medicine into Gaza — and to let civilians out. On the way to Tel Aviv, Kirby expressed some optimism that could happen soon. The Rafah crossing is effectively the only option for Palestinians to leave Gaza, and for any aid to come in. Food, water and medicine are already extremely scarce in Gaza, and the dire conditions have worsened in the last week. Hospitals are running out of electricity and are struggling to treat the thousands of injured, many of whom are children. In the meantime, there are reports that Israel has been bombing the Rafah crossing region, damaging many of the roads, which makes it unclear how the aid will be distributed even if the Rafah crossing is opened. The White House is providing less public information about the trip than usual because of the risks of traveling to the region right now. During Blinken's visit to Tel Aviv, sirens went off as a warning of new rocket attacks, and the secretary was moved to a bunker for about five minutes. But Biden has visited war zones before, including a trip to Ukraine in February. That travel wasn't revealed until the president was on the ground in Kyiv. Kirby has said Tel Aviv is not being actively targeted in the same way that Kyiv was at the time of Biden's visit.",npr_articles/article_343.txt,npr_results/article_343.txt.json
344,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/17/1206282283/gaza-aid-israel-hamas-biden-visit,"Palestinian health officials say hundreds of people have been killed in an explosion at a crowded Gaza hospital. The cause of the explosion has not yet been confirmed, with Palestinian authorities accusing Israel and Israel saying a Palestinian militant group was responsible. It comes as Israel and Hamas trade airstrikes and rocket fire and mediators press for an agreement to allow aid to enter the Gaza Strip and refugees with foreign passports to leave the enclave. Palestinian health officials said most of the victims of the explosion were women and children. Arabic news channels broadcast grim footage of the catastrophic aftermath, showing grieving parents holding their children. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the organization ""strongly condemns the attack on Al Ahili Arab Hospital in north Gaza. Early reports indicate hundreds of deaths and injuries. We call for the immediate protection of civilians and health care, and for the evacuation orders to be reversed. ""Protests broke out in Lebanon, Iraq, Turkey, Iran and Jordan in response to the blast. Palestinians in the West Bank city of Ramallah faced off with police as the crowds chanted against Israel and called for the downfall of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. In Amman, police fired tear gas at crowds chanting outside Israel's embassy. Abbas called for three days of mourning and canceled a meeting planned for Wednesday in Jordan with President Biden, according to Palestinian officials. The meeting was supposed to take place during Biden's trip to the Middle East. Shortly thereafter, the White House confirmed that his planned stop in Amman, Jordan, where he was to meet Abbas, King Abdullah II of Jordan and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi was canceled altogether. ""The President sent his deepest condolences for the innocent lives lost in the hospital explosion in Gaza, and wished a speedy recovery to the wounded,"" a White House official said in a statement. ""He looks forward to consulting in person with these leaders soon, and agreed to remain regularly and directly engaged with each of them over the coming days. ""Palestinian authorities, along with Arab governments including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, accused Israel of bombing the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza. But in a statement to NPR, the Israel Defense Forces said it considers a hospital a sensitive building and not an IDF target. In an official statement, the IDF put the blame of the hospital blast on another militant group, smaller than Hamas, called the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. ""The hospital was hit as a result of a failed rocket launched by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization,"" IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said. ""The terrorist organizations within the Gaza Strip fire indiscriminately toward Israel. Since the beginning of the war, approximately 450 rockets launched toward Israel have fallen within Gaza, endangering and harming the lives of Gazan residents. ""Before news of the explosion at the hospital, the Palestinian Health Ministry said that the death toll in Gaza Strip numbered around 3,000 and more than 12,500 wounded. It's expected that the incident at the hospital will increase these numbers. In the West Bank, 61 people are dead and more than 1,250 injured. More than 1,400 Israelis have been killed, the vast majority of that number during the unprecedented Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that included the taking of almost 200 hostages. Hospitals are already struggling to care for the thousands of injured people in Gaza as fuel for generators runs low after Israel imposed a full siege on the small territory. Earlier Tuesday, the United Nations' Palestinian relief agency, UNRWA, said a school where thousands of Gaza residents have taken refuge, was hit, killing at least six people. At least 4,000 people had taken refuge in he school in al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza when it was hit during an Israeli airstrike and bombardment, according to Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA commissioner-general. Since the war began on Oct. 7, UNRWA says it has provided the coordinates of its facilities ""to relevant parties"" daily. ""Dozens were injured (including UNRWA staff) and severe structural damage was caused to the school. The numbers are likely to be higher. This is outrageous, and it again shows a flagrant disregard for the lives of civilians,"" Lazzarini said in a statement. ""No place is safe in Gaza anymore, not even UNRWA facilities. "" The thousands who took refuge in the school still have nowhere else to go, Lazzarini said. As these incidents underscore, facilities where civilians are seeking care and shelter have come under attack as the conflict drags on. As Palestinians struggle to find safe passage, health care and clean, reliable water, officials from Hamas — the militant group that governs Gaza — remained unrepentant for the group's attack on Israel that began last Saturday. Israel says it will not stop its attacks until it has destroyed Hamas. ""Every Hamas member is a dead man,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week. The group's surprise attack targeted a music festival, where militants killed more than 200 people and sent young people fleeing into bomb shelters. ""This is a fake story. This is a fake story. Hundred percent,"" Hamas spokesman Ghazi Hamad said to NPR. Multiple eyewitnesses and video recordings have confirmed the attack on the festival. Some attendees are also among those being held hostage. Hamad spoke to NPR's Steve Inskeep for Morning Edition from inside Gaza. He didn't disclose a specific location. Of that attack, which started this latest conflict, Hamad said: ""We want to get the attention of the world. We are under oppression and torture and collective punishment all the time. That's our message for the world. ""The Israeli military says Hamas is ""responsible for the humanitarian consequences"" of the violence and chaos that followed last weekend's attack. As for the hostages taken by Hamas, Hamad claimed they were providing the nearly 200 people with shelter and protection. Those hostages include some military personnel, children and one Holocaust survivor, Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said early Tuesday morning during a briefing on X. Hamad said Hamas would not release hostages: ""But it is a war. No. Our priority now is to stop aggression and death on Gaza. ""Hamad said he is more concerned with Palestinian civilians than with hostages. Gaza's 2. 3 million residents are struggling as Israel shut off supplies of water, food and power to Gaza's main electricity grid days ago. After meetings with Israeli officials, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the U. S. and Israel had agreed to develop a plan to get aid from ""donor nations and multilateral organizations"" to the besieged Gaza Strip. ""It is critical that aid begins flowing into Gaza as soon as possible,"" Blinken said at the U. S. Embassy in Tel Aviv early Tuesday. There are also discussions to possibly establish areas to help keep civilians safe, he said. The fraught situation hinges on the border crossing at Rafah, where trucks bearing humanitarian aid are sitting in Egypt, just across at the territory's southern border. The Rafah crossing is currently closed, and the process of reopening promises to be complicated. In theory, fuel, water and other aid would flow into Gaza while refugees and foreign nationals flow out. But Israel is worried Hamas would exploit the crossing; Egypt is wary of taking in hundreds of thousands of people — and Palestinians are worried they wouldn't be allowed back into Gaza if they leave. In the wake of Israel's Oct. 13 order to evacuate the northern part of the Gaza Strip, the number of internally displaced people reached 1 million on Monday, the United Nations said. Conricus said Tuesday that about 500,000 Israelis have also been displaced in the south of Israel due to the hostilities. But Hamad, the Hamas spokesperson, said the organization has asked ""our people to stay here"" in order to ""stand against the Israeli evacuation. ""He denied the frequently cited accusation by Israel that Hamas plans to use civilians as human shields. Israeli military forces are continuing to attack Hamas in the south of the country, focusing on the Gaza Strip, while fighting new attacks from Hezbollah along the northern border with Lebanon, Conricus said. On Tuesday, Israel's military said it killed four militants attempting to cross into the country from Lebanon. Residents evacuated dozens of Israeli towns near the northern border in anticipation of full-blown fighting between Israel and Hezbollah militants. Overnight, Hamas fired rockets at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Israel's military said Tuesday that it killed Osama Mazini, a Hamas official who Israel says was responsible for prisoners taken by Hamas and who directed terrorist strikes against Israel. Gaza's Ministry of Health reported more dead and wounded from Israeli strikes. Reports say dozens were killed and dozens more wounded by strikes at Rafah and Khan Younis, an area in southern Gaza where Israel had told residents to travel in advance of an expected ground offensive in the north of the enclave. The ministry also reported that people remain trapped under the rubble of homes and buildings hit by airstrikes. Amid the growing fears of violence expanding, the White House had announced President Biden will visit the region. But now with the blast in the hospital in Gaza and canceled meetings in Jordan, Biden will only visit Tel Aviv on Wednesday where he will make a very visible show of U. S. support for the country. U. S. officials have said they believe at least a few Americans are being held hostage by Hamas, and Biden will seek an update on the hostage situation while he is in the region, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.

345,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/16/1206298283/biden-israel-gaza-hamas,"President Biden left for a quick trip to Tel Aviv, Israel on Tuesday, a visit meant to signal full U. S. support as Israel responds to the Hamas attacks. But he canceled a stop planned for Amman, Jordan after an explosion at a busy hospital in Gaza killed hundreds of people. The cause of the explosion — which happened shortly before Biden left Washington — was not immediately confirmed. Biden's meetings in Jordan were to have been focused on efforts to get humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza, and safe passage out for Americans in the conflict zone. Biden had planned to meet with Jordan's King Abdullah, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Amman. But after the explosion, Abbas said he would not travel, and declared days of mourning for the victims. In a statement, Biden said he directed his national security team to gather information about ""what exactly happened"" and said he spoke with King Abdullah and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu right after he heard about the tragedy. ""I am outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion at the Al Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, and the terrible loss of life that resulted,"" Biden said in the statement. ""The United States stands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life during conflict and we mourn the patients, medical staff and other innocents killed or wounded in this tragedy. ""Biden's trip comes as Israel prepares to launch a ground assault on Hamas in Gaza. Shortages of food, water and medicine in Gaza – and a rising civilian death toll from Israeli strikes – mean the situation is volatile. Biden will meet with Netanyahu for an update on the strategy and pace of military operations, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on a conference call Monday night. Biden has offered full-throated support for Israel as it still reels from brutal attacks by Hamas militants on Israeli civilians. More than 1,400 Israelis have been killed. The State Department has said 30 U. S. citizens were among them, and more than a dozen Americans remain unaccounted for. U. S. officials have said they believe at least a few Americans are being held hostage by Hamas, and Biden wants to get an update on the hostage situation while he is in the region, Kirby said. The Pentagon has moved an aircraft carrier strike group into the region in an attempt at deterrence. There is a significant concern that the conflict could spread, something Biden and his administration want to avoid. In an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes that aired Sunday, Biden said he believed it was necessary for Israel to be ""taking out the extremists"" both in Hamas and Hezbollah. But he said he thinks it would be ""a big mistake"" for Israel to occupy Gaza. This week the White House is expected to send a new funding request to Congress that would include additional military aid for Israel as well as a renewed ask for military and economic aid for Ukraine. Biden is not putting conditions on the military assistance provided to Israel, Kirby said. ""They have a right to defend themselves,"" he said. ""They have a right to go after this terrorist threat. And we're going to continue to do everything we can to help them do that. "" But Kirby reiterated that Biden would discuss his concern about civilian casualties. ""We have since the very beginning been discussing with our Israeli counterparts the importance of the law of armed conflict and the protection of innocent civilians,"" he said. Before the explosion at the Gaza hospital, the Palestinian Health Ministry said that the death toll in Gaza numbered around 3,000.  Biden prides himself on his decades of foreign policy experience — and boasts about the coalition he built to support Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia. In February, he made a surprise visit to Kiev, traveling through the night on an armored train through the Ukrainian countryside, to declare that the United States would be there to support Ukraine as long as it takes. However, he has faced a tough battle getting more funding for Ukraine from Congress, and polling shows American support for that conflict has waned since the early days of the war. Biden is now sending a similar signal of support with this visit to Israel, another U. S. ally at war over its territorial integrity. A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll indicates a majority of Americans want the U. S. to voice strong support for Israel. And Biden has done that, earning praise, even from critics in Israel and the US. But the poll doesn't find Biden getting much credit for it politically.

346,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/16/1206107279/the-ragged-border-crossing-that-could-become-gazas-lifeline,"I've made dozens of reporting trips to the Gaza Strip, most always because something terrible was happening. But there was one time when the mood was upbeat. It was November 2005, and the place was the Rafah border crossing, at the southern end of Gaza, the gateway to Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. Today, dusty, ragged, Rafah is part of the latest Mideast crisis. But back then it was a small beacon of hope. Israel had recently withdrawn all its settlers and soldiers from Gaza and Palestinians were taking control of the Rafah border crossing, an important practical and symbolic step. ""I think every Palestinian now has his passport ready in his pocket,"" said Mahmoud Abbas, who was then, and still is, the president of the Palestinian Authority. ""Let them come to cross at this terminal whenever they want. "" For the first time in nearly four decades, Palestinians could come and go from densely packed Gaza without having to pass through Israeli security. Rafah is the one Gaza crossing that doesn't connect to Israel, which had controlled all of Gaza's entry and exit points — including Rafah — after capturing the territory in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. That was the promise of the Rafah crossing. The reality has been hugely disappointing for the past 18 years. Israeli troops were no longer in Gaza. But the Israeli military and Hamas militants have battled long-distance, with Hamas firing rockets into Israel, and Israel hitting back with air strikes. They are now waging their most intense fighting ever. Egypt, wary of Gaza's turmoil spilling over into its country, has often made it difficult for Gazans to pass through Rafah, particularly young Gazan men. The border crossing splits the town of Rafah in two, with part on the Gaza side, and part on the Egyptian side. Many on one side have relatives on the other. When the crossing is open, Gazans go to Egypt for vacation, to study or to receive medical care. Yet more often, the border has been closed or tightly restricted. Rafah has long been a magnet for smugglers, who dug tunnels under the border, with some of entrance and exit points emerging inside homes on both sides of the border. In quiet times, smugglers have brought in cigarettes and other goods to avoid taxes. In more recent years, Hamas used the tunnels to amass an arsenal of weapons, including some of those used in the surprise Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel that killed more than 1,400 Israelis. More than 2,600 Palestinians have also died in the fighting. The original tunnels in Rafah have expanded into the elaborate subterranean network Hamas has established under Gaza today. Many Hamas members are now believed to be hiding in the tunnels as the territory braces for what's expected to be a major Israeli ground incursion. With U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken shuttling between Mideast capitals, it appeared he had negotiated at least a partial opening of the Rafah crossing for Monday morning. Hundreds of foreign nationals, including many Palestinian-Americans, lined up on the Gaza side in the hope that their passports would allow them to leave. On the Egyptian side, trucks carrying water, food, fuel and other humanitarian relief supplies were lined up, waiting to enter Gaza. However, Israel dismissed reports that it was allowing aid to come in from Egypt, saying it believed it would be used by Hamas. Hamas has run Gaza since 2007, when it seized power in a bloody battle with its Palestinian rival, Fatah, the party of President Abbas. ""Israel has not agreed to give any humanitarian aid to Hamas,"" the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Monday. The territory's more than 2 million people are running low on all basic supplies. Many residents have heeded Israel's warning and fled the northern part of Gaza, where Israeli troops have massed outside the border, for the southern end of the territory. This has raised the possibility that large numbers of Palestinians may want to exit Gaza. However, many Palestinians fear that if they depart, they may not be allowed back in. In addition, Egypt has a long history of keeping the border closed in times of crisis because it does not want to see a flood of refugees surging into its territory. Long gone is that promising moment in 2005. Back then, I spoke with Attallah Abu Assi, 65, who was among 15 family members trying to reach Egypt to visit relatives. Over the previous five years, he said his family had tried about 30 times to pass through Rafah, but was always been turned back. ""Even if we have to wait until tomorrow, this is still a day of happiness because of all the obstacles we have faced,"" he said. ",npr_articles/article_346.txt,npr_results/article_346.txt.json

348,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/16/1206100831/israel-hamas-war-gaza-water-blinken-palestine,"JERUSALEM — The U. S. and Israel have agreed to develop a plan that will get humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza — just as conditions for the area's 2. 3 million residents deteriorate. News of a plan to bring aid to the  beleaguered region came in the same announcement that President Biden plans to travel to Israel on Wednesday. The trip is meant to signal U. S. support as Israel continues its response to Hamas attacks and prepares to launch a ground assault on the Palestinian militant group in Gaza. ""It is critical that aid begins flowing into Gaza as soon as possible,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said early Tuesday morning from Israel. Blinken didn't offer any clarity on when aid may be dispatched to Gaza or what civilians there could expect. Israel began a bombardment of Gaza more than a week ago after Hamas killed at least 1,300 people in a surprise attack on Israel took scores of people hostage. Since then, Israel has killed 2,778 people in the Gaza Strip, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. And now, Gaza's residents are struggling to find clean, safe water — and some are drinking brackish water from wells, raising new health concerns in a Palestinian territory that's under siege from Israel. ""Gaza is running dry,"" UNRWA, the U. N. agency for Palestinian refugees, said on Monday, as conditions deteriorate ahead of an expected Israeli ground invasion. Electricity is dangerously scarce: Israel shut off supply to Gaza's main grid five days ago, and as hospitals cope with thousands of wounded people, fuel for generators is running low. Blinken said the U. S. and Israel share a concern that Hamas may try to seize or destroy any aid entering Gaza. He issued a warning, ""If Hamas, in any way, blocks humanitarian assistance from reaching civilians, including by seizing the aid itself, we'll be the first to condemn it. And we will work to prevent it from happening again. ""Blinken landed back in Israel on Monday after a visit last week, reiterating U. S. pledges of support for Israel — while also calling for aid and supplies to be allowed to enter Gaza. New rocket attacks briefly sent Blinken into a bunker. His meeting with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials that nailed down an aid agreement lasted more than seven hours. It's been several days of effort as Blinken and other U. S. officials have been trying to engage Egypt in helping to usher in aid to Gaza and to allow people, including Americans trapped there, to leave Gaza. The expanding humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip has pushed more international political bodies to discuss next steps, as well. European Council President Charles Michel called for an emergency meeting of the panel for Tuesday. ""It is of utmost importance that the European Council, in line with the Treaties and our values, sets our common position and establishes a clear unified course of action that reflects the complexity of the unfolding situation,"" Michel said in a statement. The Council plans to discuss providing humanitarian assistance as well as the long-term security and migration consequences of this conflict for Europe. Here's a rundown of where things stand right now:Hospitals in Gaza have been inundated with thousands injured in Israeli attacks. The U. N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported Monday that around 10,850 Palestinians have been injured. Losing electricity would plunge the hospitals into a new crisis as life support and other systems are shut down — even as injured and dead continue to be brought in. ""The shutdown of backup generators would place the lives of thousands of patients at risk,"" OCHA said. Doctors Without Borders says hospitals have also run out of painkillers. It says the wounded, many of them children, are left screaming in pain. At least 1,000 Palestinians remain missing; many of that number are presumed dead, buried in rubble. ""The specter of death is hanging over Gaza,"" said OCHA chief Martin Griffiths. At Gaza's southern border, trucks loaded with fuel, water and other humanitarian supplies are waiting to cross over from Egypt through the Rafah crossing to bring some relief to the besieged area. The border closed on Tuesday because of Israel's airstrikes on the Gaza side. Israel says there's no cease-fire deal in place to open the crossing; the U. S. says it's working on it. ""Rafah will be open,"" Blinken said on Sunday, as he visited Egypt on his way to Israel. ""We're putting in place — with the United Nations, with Egypt, with Israel, with others — the mechanism by which to get the assistance in and to get it to the people who need it,"" he said. As of Monday night in Washington, D. C. , the Rafah Crossing remained closed. Even if the crossing does reopen, it's an open question as to how the aid would be distributed. Roads leading to Rafah's crossing have been destroyed, posing a serious challenge to any efforts to distribute fuel and water. One reason the U. S. wants the border to open is so that some 500 to 600 Americans, including those of Palestinian origin, and other foreign nationals, can leave Gaza. But Egypt says that if the border crossing opens for people to exit, it must also remain open to allow aid to reach Gazans from Egypt's side. As part of his meetings in Israel, Blinken met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog to reiterate U. S. support for Israel's right to defend itself from Hamas' terrorism. He reaffirmed the U. S. commitment to provide Israel with the assistance it needs to protect its citizens. The U. S has already sent a warship to the eastern Mediterranean — a measure it says is aimed at deterrence. It has also sent to Israel ""small diameter bombs"" and is sending more ammunition and interceptor missiles for Israel's Iron Dome, which intercepts most Hamas rockets that are fired at Israel. As part of that promised U. S. support, some 2,400 Marines with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit now off Kuwait were ordered late Monday to head west into the Red Sea with a possible direction to head into the Eastern Mediterranean, an official told NPR. The Marines could take part in any civilian or embassy evacuation, the official said. Another 2,000 American troops will be sent on a short deployment, expected to last between 24 and 48 hours, to the Middle East. That force will consist of medical troops, explosive ordinance specialists and potentially military police, according to an official that spoke to NPR. None of these troops are expected to get involved in any combat missions related to the Israel-Hamas fight. Israel has repeatedly told more than 1 million Palestinians to leave their homes in northern Gaza and head south, setting a mass evacuation in motion that lacks essential supports and has no clearly defined destination. Israel says it will not stop its attacks until it has completely destroyed Hamas. ""Every Hamas member is a dead man,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week. The Israeli military dropped leaflets from the sky, telling people in northern Gaza to leave their homes. Many of the hundreds of thousands who did so traveled by foot, walking for miles. Mothers were seen carrying their babies as they headed south, with no guarantee of safety at the other end of their trek. Those left behind included people wounded in Israel's bombardment, as well as those who are disabled or elderly, or were simply unable to find transportation to take them out of the north. The Israeli military says Hamas is ""responsible for the humanitarian consequences"" of the violence and chaos that followed last weekend's attack and the ensuing evacuation order. Sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on Monday, warning of new rounds of rocket attacks. The alarms briefly sent lawmakers and others into shelters at the Knesset, where parliament was beginning its winter session. Rockets also forced Blinken to move to a bunker for about five minutes. In Israel, families are holding funerals and grieving — and some are also waiting for DNA confirmation of whether their loved ones are among the bodies found in southern Israel in communities known as kibbutzim that were overrun by the militants. The dead include 30 U. S. citizens. Other families are waiting to hear whether their missing loved ones were taken hostage. Israel's military said on Monday that 199 hostages are being held in Gaza — far higher than previous estimates. Militants in the Gaza Strip say some 22 hostages, among them foreigners, have been killed in Israeli airstrikes. In northern Israel, people who live within about a mile of the border with Lebanon are now under evacuation orders. The Israel Defense Forces say the residents will be moved into ""state-funded guesthouses. ""The evacuation order covers 28 communities, according to the IDF. Americans who want to leave Israel are doing so on planes and boats, in a slow and uncertain process. The State Department says flights are leaving from Ben Gurion International Airport on Monday and Tuesday. And on Sunday, U. S. nationals and their immediate relatives were told to report to the seaport in Haifa for a chance to board a U. S. -organized evacuation ship leaving Israel, bound for Crete. Crowds of people showed up, and officials reportedly told some to come back another time. ""People are going through the most difficult times of their history in Gaza,"" Hisham Mhanna, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross, told NPR from southern Gaza. Mhanna said there are thousands of people who have been left without any shelter, not even a blanket or mattress. Physicians have been working at their limits since the violence escalated, he said. ""Some of the doctors actually received casualties, which turned out to be members of their own families, dead and injured,"" he said. ""Despite all that, they continue to serve and they continue to save people's lives. ""A quarter of a million people have moved to shelters in Gaza over the past 24 hours, according to the UNRWA, which says most of those people are seeking refuge in schools where ""clean water has actually run out. ""Most of its shelters in Gaza have run out of clean water, and others are on daily rations, the UNRWA said. Shops have run out of bottled water, and people's water tanks have emptied. Some families in Gaza are now drinking contaminated water. The U. N. agency says 14 of its staff members are confirmed to have been killed, adding that the actual number is likely higher.

349,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/16/1205886086/biden-israel-ukraine-funding-request-congress,"For President Biden, the international coalition he brought together to support Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia is a point of pride, something made possible by his decades of foreign policy experience. He has promised allies — and Ukraine itself — that the United States will back them ""as long as it takes. "" And last week, he made similar assurances to Israel after Hamas attacked, killing more than a thousand people. ""We stand with Israel. And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,"" Biden said. But keeping those promises will take billions in funding from Congress — funding that is far from assured as the Republican-led House of Representatives struggles to overcome factional strife to name a speaker. Without a speaker, the House can't vote on anything. And a small but powerful group of House Republicans has balked at providing more funding for Ukraine. ""The combination of challenges to our democracy, having a dysfunctional Congress and then add to that that we're now part of two wars going on in Ukraine and Israel,"" said Leon Panetta, who served in the Obama and Clinton administrations, including as CIA director and defense secretary. ""It's not just the credibility of Joe Biden. It's the credibility of the United States. And the last thing this country needs to do in a dangerous world is send our adversaries a message of weakness,"" Panetta told NPR. The White House has said it will soon run out of money to help Ukraine. It originally asked Congress for $24 billion to help Ukraine make it through the end of 2023. But that request wasn't included in a stop-gap spending bill that runs until Nov. 17. Its next request is expected to be bigger, to help Ukraine defend itself into 2o24. And it will be paired with money for Israel, and possibly other priorities. Details of the funding request — known as a supplemental — have been kept under wraps, although administration officials on Friday were making the case for the funding with Hill leaders in private briefings. ""Time is not on our side,"" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters. ""The runway is not forever here, in terms of not only operations on the ground in Israel and Ukraine, but our ability to continue to provide security assistance to both partners. ""Biden told CBS' 60 Minutes that the United States can support both countries at the same time. ""We're the United States of America for God's sake, the most powerful nation in the history — not in the world, in the history of the world,"" he said. ""We have the capacity to do this and we have an obligation to . . . And, if we don't, who does?""Public support for assistance to Ukraine has slipped since the early days of the war in 2022. Biden had said he planned to give a major address to Americans to explain why he thinks it needs to continue — but then the Israel attack happened, and his public remarks have been focused on the new crisis. Most Americans say the United States should publicly support Israel, but the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll shows Biden — who has expressed a strong pro-Israel stance — has not benefited politically from that. Heather Conley, president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said it's long past time for Biden to be doing more to explain to the public why they need to back Ukraine. ""This is a time to make sure the American people understand the gravity of the situation, the investment the United States needs to make, and to make sure everyone understands the stakes that are in place,"" Conley said. Conley said the Israel crisis gives Biden another chance to explain that investing now could prevent bigger, more expensive crises down the road. ""If Ukraine is not successful in restoring its territorial integrity — if Israel struggles to defend itself — this opens the floodgates, if you will, for other countries to take advantage of the weakness, to also take advantage, to express grievance. And that price tag gets higher,"" Conley said. Being a leader on the world stage is a big part of President Biden's political identity, raising the stakes for him in this moment as the 2024 presidential election draws closer. Big foreign policy failures can hurt presidents politically, said Peter Feaver, a political scientist at Duke University who has served in both the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. That means Biden has a lot riding on Ukraine's success — and that requires Congress to continue funding military aid, Feaver said. ""If that success is replaced by a collapse in Ukraine because we stop supporting Ukraine, then the Biden foreign policy record looks much much more negative,"" Feaver said.",npr_articles/article_349.txt,npr_results/article_349.txt.json

351,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/15/1206006186/israel-defense-forces-says-its-in-formation-to-strike-gaza-city,"JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza will reopen to humanitarian aid for Palestinians currently under siege by Israeli forces. Palestinians continue to flee from northern Gaza ahead of an expected Israeli strike against Hamas targets in the area, one week after Hamas launched a multi-pronged attack inside Israel, killing more than 1,400 people. ""Rafah will be open,"" Blinken told reporters during a stop in Egypt on Sunday. ""We're putting in place — with the United Nations, with Egypt, with Israel, with others — the mechanism by which to get the assistance in and to get it to the people who need it. ""Egypt had been allowing some aid to pass into Gaza through the Rafah crossing but stopped those shipments since Tuesday following Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza side of the junction. Blinken also said it was critical that Americans and their family members in Gaza be able to evacuate ahead of the Israeli offensive. U. S. officials estimate there are 500-600 U. S. citizens in Gaza. In a meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi on Sunday, Blinken highlighted the Biden administration's focus on stopping Hamas attacks against Israel and also on preventing the hostilities from spreading throughout the region. ""The Secretary and President Sisi agreed on the importance of addressing the humanitarian situation in Gaza to ensure assistance can reach people who need it and help keep civilians out of harms way,"" State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller added. The Israeli military said on Sunday it would continue to allow Gazans to evacuate south and hundreds of thousands had already moved. On Friday, 1. 1 million people living in the north of Gaza were told to evacuate. The IDF on Sunday again urged Gaza residents to move from the northern part of Gaza to the south and said that it would not carry out any operations along the evacuation route during a three-hour period midday. ""Be assured, Hamas leaders have already ensured their safety and that of their families,"" the IDF said in its statement. The Israeli military said it received a report from a Gaza resident that Hamas had confiscated residents' personal belongings in order to prevent them from evacuating. NPR contacted Gaza resident Haneen Okal on Saturday, who was stuck at the Rafah gate in the south of Gaza. ""Lots of people are waiting here in front of the Palestinian gate. They all are waiting to get out of here, but the Palestinians are not here to open the gate and the Egyptians are not there yet too from the Egyptian side. So we are all waiting, what's going to happen? Nobody has any information,"" she said. The Israel Defense Forces said Sunday it was ""in formation"" to strike Gaza City, as troops massed on the border ready for an apparent ground invasion. Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said that northern Gaza will be the center of Israel's next counterattack in an effort to strike Hamas leaders. ""Gaza City is where the focus and the hub of Hamas activities are, that is where most of the commanders are, most of their infrastructure and their ability to continue to operate,"" Conricus said Saturday night. It comes as a second U. S. carrier strike group — the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group — has been ordered to begin moving into the Eastern Mediterranean Sea in support of Israel, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced Saturday. Medics in Gaza warned on Sunday that thousands could die if hospitals run out of fuel and basic supplies. Water and electricity are scarce. Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip have killed 2,750 Palestinians, with 9,700 wounded, the Gaza Health Ministry announced. One million people have been displaced, according to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees. On Monday, the Israeli military said 199 hostages are being held in Gaza by Hamas and other militants, far higher than previous estimates. The military did not specify whether that number includes foreigners, or say who is holding them. Previously, the IDF said that the number of confirmed Israeli hostages being held in Gaza was 126. Hamas has previously claimed that 13 hostages have been killed within Gaza by Israeli airstrikes. It said there were foreigners among those who died, without specifying their nationalities. ""Hamas is responsible for the well-being of those people,"" IDF spokesman Peter Lerner said of the hostages, speaking Monday on the BBC. ""They need to be released, they need to be released now. ""National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told NPR on Sunday afternoon that ""less than a handful"" of Americans are believed to be held hostage in Gaza and that the Biden administration hasn't ruled out using the U. S. military to help rescue them. ""We are working very diligently to get enough information to make a policy decision about how to get them back with their families. We just don't have enough information about where they are, what conditions they're being held in"" to make those decisions, Kirby said. ""Nothing is more important to President Biden than the safety and security of Americans that are being held hostage or wrongfully detained overseas,"" he said. Israel has launched a massive response to the deadly attack carried out on Oct. 7 by Hamas militants that left more than 1,400 people dead in Israel, including 30 U. S. citizens. Thirteen American nationals remain unaccounted for in the attack, a State Department spokesperson said Sunday afternoon. The Israeli military also said on Sunday that at least 286 of its soldiers have been killed in the past week. In addition, at least 55 people have been killed in the West Bank, with more than 1,200 wounded, the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates announced. The IDF said Sunday that nine rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory and that the Israeli military struck the site where the attack originated. President Biden on Sunday named veteran diplomat David Satterfield as the special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues and tasked him with responding to the ongoing turmoil in Gaza. ""Special Envoy Satterfield will lead U. S. diplomacy to urgently address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, including work to facilitate the provision of life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable people and promote the safety of civilians, in coordination with the United Nations and U. S. partners,"" Blinken said in a statement. Top Egyptian officials have also offered to host an international summit to address ""the developments and future of the Palestinian issue. ""Pope Francis said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that he was following ""with great sorrow"" the latest developments in the conflict. ""I renew my appeal for the freeing of the hostages and I strongly ask that children, the sick, the elderly, women, and all civilians not be made victims of the conflict,"" he said.",npr_articles/article_351.txt,npr_results/article_351.txt.json
352,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/14/1205951123/gaza-israel-palestinians-flee-ground-assault,"Israel's military says it is readying a widespread attack in Gaza City, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have scrambled to evacuate over the past day. On Saturday night local time, Israel's chief military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, urged Gazans to head south ahead of the expected ground assault in northern Gaza. ""We are going to attack Gaza City very broadly soon,"" Hagari said. In a separate statement, the Israel Defense Forces said Saturday that it was getting ready for ""the next stages of the war. ""It said it was preparing ""a wide range of operational offensive plans, which can include combined and coordinated strikes from the air, sea and land"" with a strong emphasis on ground operations. On Friday, the Israeli military sent out an unprecedented evacuation order affecting over 1 million residents, about half of Gaza's population, in the northern part of the enclave. Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said that northern Gaza will be the center of Israel's next counterattack in an effort to strike Hamas leaders. ""Gaza City is where the focus and the hub of Hamas activities are, that is where most of the commanders are, most of their infrastructure and their ability to continue to operate,"" Conricus said Saturday. He added that troops are ""in formation"" surrounding the Gaza Strip for the next stage of operations. The Rafah crossing in southern Gaza was expected to be open until 5 p. m. local time Saturday (10 a. m. ET) for Americans attempting to leave Gaza, a senior State Department official said. U. S. officials estimate that between 500 and 600 Palestinian Americans are in Gaza, but it is unclear how many are seeking to leave. Efforts to flee northern Gaza have also been complicated by Israel's ongoing airstrikes and military presence. Large numbers of Israeli troops and armored vehicles are assembled just outside Gaza's border fence. On Saturday morning, President Biden said the U. S. is working with Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the United Nations ""to surge support to ease the humanitarian consequences of Hamas's attack, create conditions needed to resume the flow of assistance, and advocate for the upholding of the law of war. ""Biden also spoke separately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday. Biden vowed to work with other countries in the region to ensure supplies reach civilians in Gaza and to work to prevent the conflict from widening, the White House said. Speaking on Saturday night at a dinner for the LGBTQ+ rights advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign, Biden blamed Hamas for the violence. He added: ""The humanitarian crisis in Gaza — innocent Palestinian families — the vast majority have nothing to do with Hamas, they're being used as human shields. "" Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Saturday to discuss the conflict with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud. ""None of us want to see suffering by civilians on any side, whether it's in Israel, whether it's in Gaza, whether it's anywhere else,"" Blinken said. ""And we're working together to do our best to protect them. ""  Amid the fighting, Gazans are also reeling from the lack of electricity and clean water. On Wednesday, Israel tightened its siege of Gaza, wreaking havoc on hospitals that are now left with only backup generators. The World Health Organization on Saturday called Israel's orders for the evacuation of 22 hospitals in northern Gaza a ""death sentence"" for the more than 2,000 inpatients there.  The power shortage has also affected Gaza's water supply, leaving residents only with unsanitary wells, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. Tasneem Ahl, a medical student in Gaza, described the water supply crisis as dire. ""You drink your water or you wash your face and brush your teeth,"" Ahl told NPR. ""Brushing your teeth has become a luxury for us. Your mouth is like a desert. ""Ahl said her family's home was recently bombed and they are unsure where they will seek shelter. Israel has launched a massive response to the deadly attack launched on Oct. 7 by Hamas militants that left more than 1,300 people dead in Israel, including 29 U. S. citizens. Some 2,200 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's bombardment of Gaza. On Friday, the Israeli military staged limited raids into the Gaza Strip in an effort to find Israelis who were kidnapped by Hamas. Israeli forces said they retrieved bodies of several missing Israelis, as well as items that could potentially lead them to more missing people. Hagari, the Israeli military spokesperson, added that troops destroyed ""terrorist infrastructure and squads, including a Hamas unit that fired anti-tank missiles toward Israel. ""Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Richard Hecht said about 265 Israeli soldiers have died, while 120 people remain hostages in Gaza. Hecht added that violence in the West Bank — which Israelis refer to as Judea and Samaria — spiked as well, leading the Israel Defense Forces to take action there. ""We apprehended 220 people, and 130 of them are Hamas — you know how dominant Hamas is in Judea and Samaria. And again, we're following closely any nationalistic crime from our side, too,"" Hecht said, referring to an attack by Jewish settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank, captured on video by the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem. Israeli troops and civilians pulled out of Gaza in 2005 after nearly four decades in the territory. Since then, Israeli forces have re-entered Gaza to fight Hamas a number of times. The largest operation was in 2014, which lasted seven weeks. The invasion claimed 2,000 Palestinian lives, and more than 70 on the Israeli side. While it was a major setback from Hamas, the militant group was able to rebuild.

353,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/14/1205809697/israel-gaza-college-campus-protests-statements,"The violence in Israel and Gaza has heightened tensions on college campuses across the U. S. , as students, staff, and administrators grapple with how to respond. Pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian student groups are weighing in online and in person, with many of their statements and protests provoking strong reactions from the other side. Take the controversy at Harvard, where dozens of student groups signed onto a letter from the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee (PSC) on Oct. 7 — the day Hamas launched its surprise attack on Israel — holding Israel ""entirely responsible for all unfolding violence. ""The letter garnered widespread backlash from students, faculty, high-profile alumni, politicians, and even Harvard's president. Several groups have since retracted their support of the letter, though some of their members have been doxxed. In New York, the president of NYU's Student Bar Association wrote that ""Israel bears full responsibility for this tremendous loss of life,"" in a letter to the group that quickly went viral and drew widespread condemnation. The student has since lost their law firm job offer and is in the process of being removed from their leadership role. Student groups have also held vigils and protests, which in some cases have led to direct confrontations between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups. Protesters clashed at schools, including the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Indiana University, in recent days. Columbia University closed its campus to the public on Thursday due to safety concerns over two planned student protests, a day after an Israeli student was allegedly assaulted with a stick outside its library. Some university administrations have been more vocal than others, with their comments — or lack thereof — further stirring up emotions. Some, like University of Florida President Ben Sasse, have issued statements strongly supporting Israel and Jewish students. Others, like Vanderbilt University and Ohio State University, have been more neutral. And certain schools haven't weighed in at all — Stanford University's statement stressed its policy of neutrality, while Northwestern University's president announced he won't be releasing an official statement on the school's position on this or other geopolitical issues going forward. How exactly should colleges be responding to this current moment, both to support students' rights and protect their safety? It's a complicated question, experts tell NPR. Eboo Patel, the founder and president of Interfaith America — an organization that works with nearly 1,000 campuses on interfaith issues — described a phone call he got from a college president who was worried that a peaceful vigil could turn violent. His response was that colleges need to be two things right now: communities of care and cooperation. People are hurting, he adds, and words matter. ""We're not going to minimize the conflict, we're simply going to say that we are not going to allow the conflict to prevent us from cooperating on other things,"" Patel says. ""That's the genius of American college campuses. That's what college presidents and athletic directors and faculty and staff and students need to keep their focus on right now. ""The Israeli-Palestinian conflict was already a divisive topic on college campuses, as in U. S. society at large. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds that, while two-thirds of Americans say the United States should publicly support Israel in the war between Israel and Hamas, there are wide generational and racial differences. Students have been on the cutting edge of social justice movements throughout history, from protesting the Vietnam War to fighting for immigrants' rights, says Radhika Sainath, a staff attorney at U. S. -based advocacy group Palestine Legal. She says pro-Palestinian advocacy on college campuses is not new, nor is the backlash against students who speak out. But she says her group has seen an ""exponential surge"" in requests for legal help — as many as 10-20 a day — from people who have been fired from their jobs, questioned or threatened for expressing support for Palestinian rights. Sainath stressed that the First Amendment right to free speech is protected at public universities and most private schools, depending on the state. But sometimes, she says, universities violate their own policies. ""People are just really, really scared right now at universities and across the country, especially students and professors are really worried about what they are able to say,"" she said. Jewish students say they're scared, too, with antisemitism on the rise in much of the country. A September Ipsos poll found that 57% percent of Jewish college students report having witnessed or experienced an antisemitic incident, either on their campus or in the general public. Caroline Yaffa, a senior at UNC-Chapel Hill, says she feels unsafe because of several recent incidents on campus. She says her parents are worried about her safety going to classes, and the thought of showing her ID — with her Jewish last name — at a bar makes her anxious now. ""It's so upsetting because I love my heritage, I love my religion, I love going to synagogue, I love celebrating the holidays with my family when we all get together, and I'm not ashamed of it,"" she said. ""But I also want to protect my safety. ""Yaffa believes universities are obligated to weigh in on events like the Israel-Hamas conflict because they represent ""every single person in their community"" and should protect all of its members. She said she would have felt safer on campus if UNC leadership had done more beyond talking with students and posting a statement on social media. Hours after she spoke with NPR on Friday, UNC Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz sent a campus message condemning Hamas' actions in Israel and promoting resources for all affected students and staff, for which Yaffa said she was ""beyond grateful. """"I think it's never too late to support these innocent people,"" she said. ""I think it's never too late to support the Jewish community. ""Students for Justice in Palestine sees universities' role differently. The student activist group (which the Anti-Defamation League has roundly criticized) has chapters at hundreds of U. S. campuses and has been behind many of the recent protests. The organization's steering committee — a mix of both current students and recent graduates — told NPR over email that they don't believe universities always need to take a public stance on global events. But they say universities do have an obligation to defend students' rights to speak and protest, and protect them from smear campaigns and doxxing. They said public university statements have maligned pro-Palestinian protests as support for violence, ""even while vocally affirming their right to free speech. """"Universities have intentionally abandoned Palestinian, Arab, and anti-Zionist students in this political moment, giving tacit support to the dangerous backlash they face,"" they added. Sainath, the Palestine Legal attorney, says she has seen a pattern of schools putting out statements that only mention the pain and loss of Israeli and Jewish students, ""basically erasing Palestinian pain. ""Students from all backgrounds and viewpoints are hurting, and the first priority of any college should be to respond to that human suffering, says Patel, of Interfaith America. ""That is not both sides-ism,"" he says. ""That is: There is a human being in front of me whose family is in danger and that person is hurting and I am going to show that person care. ""Alex Morey, the director of campus rights advocacy at civil liberties nonprofit FIRE, said universities are under pressure — and competing demands — to weigh in on current events. She says institutions were in a similar position in 2020, with the confluence of racial justice protests, a raging pandemic and a high-stakes presidential election. Since then, it's been common for schools to release statements about all sorts of issues. ""But then they get to things like the war in the Middle East, where there's really no correct answer, yet they have put themselves in a situation where not saying anything is unusual for them,"" Morey adds. ""And so when they don't say anything, what does that mean?""She says universities are now in a ""no-win position"" because of this trend. But she sees a way out — and it's following the footsteps of places like Stanford and Northwestern, and removing themselves from the debate. Morey would like more of them to say: ""We are a university that plays host to these debates of issues that are of incredible importance. We are not going to put our thumb on the scale as the university one way or another because that will chill the environment for free expression, for scholarly inquiry. ""She says those institutions will get pushback in the immediate term, but will make their lives much easier in the medium- and long-term. She says there are other ways university leaders can support students when difficult things are going on in the world, like offering condolences and counseling services. ""The best thing they can do when these divisive issues come up is do their university thing,"" she adds. ""That's what they do best: Host these debates, have students come together in a way that is constructive and in a way that students feel like they have a place to be heard and that the debate can go on in a scholarly, civil way.

354,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/13/1205627092/american-support-israel-biden-middle-east-hamas-poll,"Two-thirds of Americans say the United States should publicly support Israel in the war between Israel and Hamas, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, but there are wide generational and racial divides on the question. At this point, more Americans, but not a majority, think Israel's response has been appropriate, though an overwhelming number of respondents are worried the war will spill over into a broader regional conflict. Seven in 10 Americans said they are paying close attention to the war. And, even though most agree that the U. S. should publicly support Israel, President Biden — who has voiced strong public support for the Jewish nation — is not benefiting politically. The survey of 1,313 adults was conducted Wednesday and has a margin of error of +/- 3. 8 percentage points, meaning results could be about 4 points lower or higher. Respondents were reached by telephone using live interviewers, by text or online. Overall, 65% said the U. S. should support Israel publicly. That was true of big majorities of both parties — 77% of Republicans and 69% of Democrats. Notably, independents were less likely to believe this — 54% thought the U. S. should publicly support Israel, but a third said the U. S. shouldn't say or do anything. But there are huge age and racial gaps — 78% of those 45 and older think the U. S. should take a publicly pro-Israel stance, but just 48% of those under 45 said so. This is particularly true of the youngest Americans eligible to vote — just 48% of Gen Z/millennials said the U. S. should publicly voice support, as compared to 63% of Gen X, 83% of baby boomers and 86% of the Silent/Greatest generation. Along racial lines, just 51% of nonwhites said the U. S. should take such a public stance supporting Israel, while 72% of whites thought it should. Eight in 10 said they are concerned that the Israel-Hamas war will lead to a broader conflict in the Middle East. Notably there was a significant gender gap here. Women were 16 points more likely to worry that the conflict would spread (87%) compared to men (71%). At this point, more Americans say Israel's response has been about right — 44% said so. About a quarter said, though, that it's been too much and roughly another quarter said it's been too little. Democratic men were the most likely to say that Israel's response has been too much (44%), followed by those who live in big cities (41%), those under 45 (37%) and Biden supporters (37%). On the other hand, white men without college degrees (45%), Republican men (44%), white evangelical Christians (40%) and Donald Trump supporters (39%) were the most likely to say it's been too little. By a 53%-41% margin, respondents said they believe U. S. support for Israel makes the Middle East safer. But there are some notable deviations, particularly among younger Americans. Gen Z/millennials were the only group tested in which a majority (54%) said the U. S. 's support for Israel makes the region more dangerous. Here again, there was a racial divide. By a 49%-to-42% margin, nonwhites said U. S. support for Israel makes the region more dangerous. Whites were 17 points more likely compared to nonwhites to say U. S. support for Israel made the region safer. It is notable, however, that 36% of Republicans also said they believe the country's support for Israel makes the Middle East more dangerous. That's a significant slice, considering the sharper divides by party on many other issues. There's certainly no rally-'round-the-flag effect for Biden at this point. Americans so far aren't impressed with how the president has handled himself during this war — despite his strong show of public support for Israel coming as two-thirds report saying they want a strong show of public U. S. support. Biden has arguably taken a stronger pro-Israel stance than nearly any other U. S. president, yet 52% said they disapprove of Biden's handling of this conflict. That seems to reflect just how sharp the U. S. political divide is at this moment, as that disapproval number is identical to Biden's overall job approval rating. Self-declared Democrats are largely in Biden's corner — 86% approve of the job he's doing as president. But he drops 9 points with his party when it comes to his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. He continues to struggle with independents (32% approve of his job performance overall) and those under 45 (41%). Even among groups that have supported him in the past, he lags in approval. Only 45% of nonwhites approve of the job he's doing, 21 points below where he was with the group in the Marist poll shortly after he was elected to office. All three are key groups Biden needs in his corner if he hopes to be reelected.",npr_articles/article_354.txt,npr_results/article_354.txt.json
355,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/13/1205448988/hamas-military-mohammed-deif-gaza-israel,"LONDON — His nom de guerre ""Deif"" means ""guest"" in Arabic — a reference to his habit of staying in a different house each night to evade Israeli attacks. Mohammed Deif is the elusive head of Hamas' military wing and the man believed to be behind the group's unprecedented Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Within hours of the attack, a recorded statement was released by a Hamas TV channel, according to Reuters, claiming to show Deif. ""Enough is enough,"" the figure in the video said, appearing as a silhouette. He announced the beginning of what he called ""Operation Al-Aqsa Storm,"" a reference to the mosque in Jerusalem, Islam's third-holiest site, where Israelis have carried out recent raids. The death toll from Saturday's attack — in which Hamas militants entered Israel from Gaza on paragliders and broke through a barrier fence, killing and kidnapping people — has reached 1,300. An estimated 150 people were kidnapped from Israel and taken hostage. Israel's ongoing retaliatory offensive on the Gaza Strip has so far killed 1,500 Palestinians. Israel gave an order Thursday for more than 1 million people living in northern Gaza to evacuate the area. Here is what to know about the man believed to have masterminded the attack. Much about Deif's early life is unknown or unconfirmed. According to reports by international media outlets, Deif was born in the Khan Younis refugee camp in southern Gaza in the early 1960s. The European Council on Foreign Relations says Deif was born in Gaza in 1965. Some reports say Deif was part of a theater group called The Returners while a university student in Gaza. Avi Melamed, a Middle East expert at the Eisenhower Institute, told the Washington Post this was something Deif kept up even after joining Hamas, sometimes acting parts in the group's propaganda videos. Deif joined Hamas around the time of the first intifada or Palestinian uprising in 1987, and was arrested by Israel for his activities in 1989, a Hamas source told Reuters. He spent more than a year in an Israeli jail but returned to Gaza in the early 1990s, when he began rising quickly in the Hamas ranks. ""He has been active in Hamas for decades. Even before 10/7, he was a wanted man. Now after, he's even more of a wanted man,"" says Raphael Cohen of the RAND Corporation. ""We know he's masterminded other large scale terrorist attacks,"" Cohen says. Deif has been accused of overseeing several suicide bombings, killing dozens of Israelis, from 1995 onward. He became the head of Hamas' military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, in July 2002, after Israel assassinated its former leader, Saleh Shehada. Since then, Deif has become known as the architect of Hamas' military strategy. The State Department has designated Deif as a terrorist and he has long been on Israel's most wanted list. ""He has been subject to a number of previous Israeli assassination attempts,"" says Hugh Lovatt, senior policy fellow with the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, who has researched and written about Deif's life. ""These have left him — according to some rumors — disfigured or partially paralyzed. He has also lost family members in the attacks. He does appear to have borne the brunt of Israeli attacks against him. ""According to some reports, the assassination attempts left Deif blind in one eye and resulted in the amputation of some of his limbs. During the 2014 Israel-Hamas war, Deif's wife and one of his children were killed in an Israeli-targeted airstrike on a house in Gaza that was aimed at assassinating him. Deif — who has also been nicknamed ""the cat with nine lives"" — was not in the building at the time and evaded the attempt on his life. Now the military commander spends all of his time sheltering from Israeli attacks and potential assassination, says Lovatt. ""The fact that he has personally been injured, the fact that he has lost family members in Israeli attacks, the fact that he spends his whole time in bunkers in Gaza, probably does a lot to shape his mentality,"" he says. ""A bunker mentality, quite literally. ""Lovatt says this helps in understanding the severity of Hamas' latest attack on Israel — and the direction Hamas is taking. ""This was something organized by Hamas' military leadership, without the political leadership knowing about it until quite recently,"" he says. ""In some ways, this is a military takeover of Hamas. This is clearly where the center of power is, in the way it hasn't been for some time. ""And, Lovatt says, Deif is at the center of this strategic shift. ""The question, though, is what happens to Hamas in the weeks to come,"" he says. ""If the view within the movement is that this didn't work, there will be a shift in the power dynamics.

356,https://www.npr.org/sections/pictureshow/2023/10/13/1205415757/israel-hamas-attack-survivors-sderot-photos,"SDEROT, Israel — This assaulted Israeli town of more than 35,000 residents is now deserted — nearly. Israeli authorities evacuated civilians from Sderot and other areas along the Gaza border after Hamas militants launched an attack Saturday that has killed more than 1,300 people in Israel. A few survivors have remained behind. In one Sderot building, its windows shattered by a Hamas rocket, is a Ukrainian immigrant. She cares for an ill Holocaust survivor. Both are staying behind: one from a country at war, taking care of a survivor of another war, in their adoptive country fighting a new war. In the same building, there are eight guest workers from China — construction workers — crowded in a room with beds and cooking pots. One of the laborers, Jiang Hua, says their boss told them there weren't any vehicles to get them out of the town since the attacks began Saturday. They've heard gunfire and rocket fire for days on end. But he says they're reassured by the Israeli forces in the city. A short drive away, the carcass of a car sits next to a grocery store. In another part of the city, a police station is in ruins, decimated by Israeli tank fire after Hamas militants stormed it, killing the police officers inside. At the entrance of the city, Israeli medics and warriors take a break at a makeshift rest station next to a reinforced shelter. Efi Menahem, the sergeant of a special forces unit of the paramilitary border police, says he killed Hamas men next to an Israeli home. He says he saw Israelis' bodies without heads — burned or chopped off, he's not sure. ""Any emotions, you lock away,"" Menahem says. Naomi Galeano, a medic with the United Hatzalah volunteer rescue service, spent the afternoon of the attacks driving past the carnage of bodies, looking for anyone still alive. ""There were more dead than alive,"" she says. ""The world doesn't even know yet the amount of butchered bodies. ""Less than a mile away is the Gaza Strip, where more than 1,500 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli reprisal airstrikes. Its 2 million residents are trapped in the small coastal territory — blockaded by Israel and Egypt — without reinforced shelters and unable to flee. Militants in Gaza fire rockets across the border. They speed through the cloudy afternoon skies. Galeano calls out to the crowds of medics and soldiers to duck into the reinforced outdoor shelter. ""Get in, get in, get in,"" she calls out. The concrete shelter walls shake with each boom. Then the medics hop in their ambulance, and the paramilitary fighters board their vehicles, and they all speed off.",npr_articles/article_356.txt,npr_results/article_356.txt.json

There aren't enough beds to hold all the patients. ""Others are on the floor. ""The smell of death is everywhere as well, Mattar says. On Friday he wrote to NPR: ""A few minutes back we received the bodies of our colleague Dr. Mohamed Dabour [a consultant pathologist] and all of his family. They have been attacked by air strike while he was attempting to evacuate his family to a safe area in south Gaza, according to [evacuation] commands they received from the Israeli side. ""It's a common and tragic refrain among health professionals in Gaza. As the war between Hamas and Israel grinds into its seventh day with a blockade that's sealed off Gaza from the rest of the world, the medical situation for Gazans is increasingly desperate. And Israel has now issued a declaration that Gazans should evacuate the north within 24 hours, a harbinger of even more intense conflict. Israel launched its first retaliatory strike in Gaza several hours after the unprecedented attack by Hamas militants began early Saturday morning. The Hamas attackers killed at least 1,300 people in Israel and returned to Gaza with an estimated 150 hostages. Children and the elderly were among the victims. The Palestinian Health Ministry says Israel's ensuing bombardment in the territory has killed more than 1,500 Palestinians and wounded thousands more who now require medical attention. Plus, there are those who aren't able to obtain routine medical care and drugs they need. Israel has reported that Hamas hides weapons and soldiers within and near hospitals and health facilities, complicating its military attacks. As of Thursday, the World Health Organization had documented at least 34 health care-related attacks (involving health workers, facilities and ambulances) and warns that the health system in Gaza is at a breaking point. On Wednesday night, bombs exploded near Al-Quds Hospital, says Nadal Abed, an orthopedic surgeon with the Ministry of Health in Gaza. ""The wounded patient[s] have difficult injuries due to explosive[s],"" he says, ""multiple injur[ies] in head, in chest, in abdomen, in extremities. ""Abed was reassigned to Al-Quds on Monday morning where his job is to put people back together — by removing shrapnel and resetting broken bones. Even though he is working 24-hour shifts, he says the wait for surgery can take days. There are too many patients and too few surgeons. Plus, he says he's dealing with dwindling surgical supplies. Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon based in London who traveled to Gaza early in the week to tend the wounded, reports similar injuries among patients at Al Awda hospital. ""Basically, the patients are all blast injury patients with shrapnel injuries, crush injuries from collapsed homes, burns,"" he says. ""Everybody that I'm seeing is being fished out of the rubble of their homes and they're caked in mud and gravel and masonry. And even the shrapnel that you take out of their bodies is masonry and glass and household building material. ""Israel has switched off Gaza's electricity, so most power including for hospitals is now coming from backup generators that run on diesel. ""If that runs out,"" says Dr. Abu-Sittah, ""then the hospitals will go dark because there's no electricity. "" It's a scenario that WHO warns would have devastating impacts on the most vulnerable groups — not only the severely injured but patients in intensive care and newborns dependent on incubators. ""In normal time without escalation,"" says Dr. Abed, ""we have difficulties, I mean, big difficulties. And with this situation with big numbers of wounded patients, the health sector is about to fail, actually. ""One strand of that failure is already evident for those with conditions predating the war. ""I have been receiving calls from patients who have, for example, epilepsy or neuropathy or multiple sclerosis or stroke who run out of their medications and they need a prescription,"" says Belal Aldabbour, a clinical neurologist who, during calmer times, saw patients in a private practice and taught medicine at the Islamic University of Gaza. But he says a lot of pharmacies are now shuttered. Those that have remained open are practically empty due to the cutoff of all supplies to Gaza, including medications. Patients who are unable to continue taking drugs for these conditions can suffer pain and seizures. ""The best solution would be to halt the conflict immediately,"" says Dr. Aldabbour. ""But I'm aware that this is at the hands of the politicians. ""WHO and King Abdullah II of Jordan have called upon the immediate establishment of a humanitarian corridor to get urgently needed food, water and medical supplies to Palestinians within Gaza who have been sealed off by an absolute blockade. (Previously, since 2007, Gaza had been under a partial blockade by both Israel and Egypt. )Dr. Medhat Abbas, the director general of the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, says the barricade is amplifying the crisis. ""There is no way to get extra fuel from outside,"" he says. ""There is no way to get food. So what we need right now is a humanitarian corridor to take patients outside, to bring medical crews from outside, medical assistance and to open borders for fuel and return back electricity to Gaza Strip at once. ""Without outside help, many fear continued agony from the siege. And now, the Israeli military has ordered over a million Palestinians to evacuate the north half of Gaza as their siege of the embattled area progresses into its next phase — a widely expected ground invasion accompanying further air strikes. On Friday, a mass exodus began from the northern part of Gaza. The World Heatlh Organization and the United Nations have both appealed to Israel to rescind the evacuation orders. A mass evacuation would be disastrous, they say, for patients, health workers and other civilians left behind or caught up in the mass movement. Without reliable communication channels, Dr. Mattar says confusion is rampant. ""Not all people can evacuate that easily within 24 hours,"" he says. ""Many families have sick patients, they have elderly that cannot walk, they have kids. Many obstacles that are present. I hope this news [to evacuate is] not true. ""WHO says that moving vulnerable individuals like this is tantamount to ""a death sentence. Asking health workers to do so is beyond cruel. """"We received many casualties, many injured people, attacked while trying to evacuate from Gaza, as we have been told,"" says Dr. Mattar. ""Many of them are children, kids without identity, without family. """"We don't have options,"" says Dr. Aldabbour. ""We just do what we have to do. We survive day to day. ""Aldabbour thinks a lot about his own situation — ""I have a career, I have dreams,"" he says — and more importantly, about the survival of his own family. He tells his two young boys that the war will end soon, although he says his older son doesn't always believe him. He and his wife refuse to endure the war in separate places. ""We either die together or live together,"" he says. ""Hopefully it is the latter. """,npr_articles/article_357.txt,npr_results/article_357.txt.json
358,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/13/1205180037/israel-gaza-travel-flights,"Airlines and governments around the world were rushing to get visitors trapped by the raging conflict in Israel and the Gaza Strip back home as the U. S. warns any future travelers to the area to rethink their plans. The fighting started almost a week ago after Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,300 Israelis and taking some 150 hostages — some of whom are believed to be Americans. Israel has retaliated with intense airstrikes into the Gaza Strip, cutting off access to food, water and fuel for the 2. 3 million residents there. Palestinian officials say at least 1,400 people were killed, an estimated 60% are women and children, and hundreds of thousands of others have been displaced. The death and destruction of this latest conflict has forced many airlines to cancel flights to Tel Aviv, preventing foreign visitors in Gaza and Israel from returning home and disrupting Israel's travel industry. Tourism is a steady share of Israel's economy, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. In 2019, it directly accounted for 2. 6% of the country's GDP and 3. 8% of total employment. With COVID-19, it dropped substantially as borders closed. As of 2023, the country was still struggling to fully rebound from pre-pandemic levels. Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport, the country's largest and busiest, says it is still working as planned. Flights into Israel are still being allowed as Israelis return home. But flying out of Israel is proving more difficult, with a substantial number of flights canceled in and out of Tel Aviv, according to Flightradar24. Delta says it is canceling all flights to Tel Aviv through Oct. 31. American Airlines has suspended operations to and from Tel Aviv through Dec. 4. United has also canceled direct flights. Other nations have stepped in to find ways to get their citizens out. Brazil's government is getting six planes to repatriate its some 20,000 citizens who live in Israel, the West Bank or Gaza and want to leave. The U. K. 's Foreign Office said it is arranging flights for Britons stuck in Israel, with the first flight out scheduled for Thursday. A senior U. S. official told NPR that it's working to get approximately 400-600 U. S. citizens out of Gaza. Roughly 100 of them have contacted the embassy for help to leave. Wafaa Abuzayda is trapped in Gaza with her husband and her 1-year-old son and is pleading with the U. S. Embassy for help. The 30-year-old grew up in Gaza but moved to the U. S. seven years ago. She told NPR's Morning Edition's Leila Fadel  that they were visiting for just two weeks. Now it's unclear when they will be able to leave. ""We changed our tickets like three to four times . . . and then we decided to come to Gaza at this time,"" she said. ""And our short vacation just turned into a nightmare. "" She said they are running out of milk and diapers. She added, ""And in the meantime they keep posting stuff about the U. S. citizens in Israel. Every five minutes they keep reminding the people in Israel to get out of Israel. "" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters earlier this week that there are ""viable ground routes"" for Americans if they wanted to leave Israel that way. However, there are limited hours for some border crossings, according to Israel's Ministry of Tourism. The agency is providing assistance to those who need it and is operating a hotline via WhatsApp for tourists to stay informed as the situation in Israel evolved. Kirby said the Biden administration is exploring a range of other options to assist Americans who want to leave, but didn't elaborate. The U. S. State Department issued a new warning for Americans traveling to Israel, urging potential tourists to reconsider a trip there. The agency also issued a ""reconsider travel"" alert for the West Bank and a ""do not travel"" alert for Gaza. Some Israeli travel agencies are trying to help visitors find a way out of the country. Tourist Israel, one of the nation's largest, announced it was offering free transportation to and from the south of Israel for anyone who needs a ride starting on Sunday, Oct. 15. They are also offering shuttle rides to Jordan for a fee. It's still too early to determine what the impact on Israel's tourism industry will be, Noa Bauer, an executive at Taglit-Birthright Israel, told NPR. Birthright Israel offers a free 10-day trip to Israel for young adults of Jewish heritage. The strength of the bonds formed during such trips was made clear when the conflict broke out last week, Bauer said. ""We've had 850,000 alumni that are calling their Israeli friends and anyone they know in Israel asking them how they are, if they can help them, what they need,"" Bauer said. Birthright had no trips on the ground at the time the war broke out, Bauer said.  Israel has gone through wars and other brief conflicts in the past, and Birthright Israel has never stopped trips, she said, although they were paused amid the COVID-19 pandemic. ""I think that this is different than anything we've experienced in the past,"" she said of the latest conflict. ""It's very unclear how long this will take. "" But, she promised, they will be back. ""I can assure you that we're going to have participants back dancing and having a great time in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv,"" she said. ",npr_articles/article_358.txt,npr_results/article_358.txt.json
359,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/13/1205672587/israel-warns-evacuate-northern-gaza,"JERUSALEM — More than 1 million residents of the besieged Gaza Strip were told Friday in paper notices dropped from the sky to leave their homes. The unprecedented evacuation order from the Israeli military unleashed a new level of panic and chaos in the territory, which has been plunged into darkness since the main power plant shut down completely two days ago after running out of fuel. The order comes ahead of Israel's expected counterattack after Palestinian militants from the Gaza Strip launched a large-scale attack last week on southern cities in Israel, breaking through a barrier and gunning down civilians and soldiers. About 1,300 people in Israel were killed, and more than 100 hostages were taken to Gaza, Israeli officials say. ""This is just the beginning,"" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a nationally televised speech on Friday. ""We will end this war stronger than ever. ""Some 300,000 Israeli reservists are positioned along Israel's border with Gaza for an anticipated ground invasion. Israeli officials have vowed to defend Israel and stamp out Hamas, the Islamist group that governs Gaza and whose military wing led the assault on Israel. The evacuation order — which marks a dramatic escalation of Israel's retaliation — impacts half of Gaza's population and encompasses its largest city, Gaza City, and the territory's main medical center, Al-Shifa Hospital. After days of retaliatory airstrikes, the death toll in Gaza has reached 1,900, many of them children, according to Palestinian health officials. More than 7,600 people have been wounded. Hamas called on Palestinians to ignore the Israeli evacuation order and remain ""steadfast in your homes. ""Hamas interior ministry spokesman Eyad Al-Bozom accused Israelis of an intent to ""displace us once again from our land,"" a reference to what Palestinians call the Nakba — the expulsion of 700,000 Palestinians in 1948 when the state of Israel was established. The Arabic word means ""catastrophe. ""Noor Harazeen, a freelance journalist whose home is in central Gaza, evacuated Friday with her children and husband to the south to take shelter in a hospital. Her parents refused to leave, she said, calling the evacuation order a ""second Nakba. """"They will not do what happened in the previous Nakba. They will not leave their home,"" she told NPR. Harazeen's family was ""lucky"" to evacuate by car, she said. On the drive south, she saw hundreds of people walking the 20 miles or more to safety. ""People are shocked. People are trying to understand what is really happening in Gaza,"" she said. ""Will we go back to our homes? Will our homes be there? Will our homes be destroyed? What will happen? So many questions in my head and in other people's heads. ""It's a new catastrophe. It's a new Nakba for the Palestinian people here in Gaza,"" she said. As Palestinian families in Gaza tried to evacuate Friday, some were struck in their cars by Israeli airstrikes, killing dozens of people — many of them women and children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. There is no safe place for people to flee to. The territory, which is roughly 140 square miles in area — far smaller than most U. S. counties — is completely sealed off. All of Gaza's border crossings have been closed by Israel, and its crossing with Egypt was bombed and remains shut. All of Gaza's residents are trapped inside for now. The evacuation order drew immediate outcry from humanitarian groups. Jan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, called on Israel to reverse the evacuation order. ""Absent of any guarantees of safety or return, [it] would amount to the war crime of forcible transfer,"" he said. The United Nations, which has several humanitarian facilities in the evacuation area, reported that Israel advised U. N. staff to evacuate within 24 hours. The U. N. said it would be ""impossible"" to move so many Gazans without ""devastating humanitarian consequences. ""The U. N. said it is not able to take in so many evacuees. ""We believe that it cannot happen in a safe manner and certainly not in 24 hours,"" Lynn Hastings, the United Nations' top humanitarian coordinator in Gaza, told NPR. The U. N. 's relief organization in Gaza, known as UNRWA, is already sheltering some 270,000 displaced Palestinians in 102 schools across Gaza, about half of which were not previously equipped to be shelters. UNRWA said it had moved its operations center and international staff to the southern part of Gaza, which has also been under days of constant heavy bombardment by Israel. There is no way for hospitals and clinics in northern Gaza, treating the stream of wounded victims from near-constant bombings, to be evacuated. Roads are damaged, and ambulances, which have also been stuck, are driving in the dead and wounded from continuous airstrikes. On Friday, hours after the evacuation leaflets began to land, Hussam Abu Safiya, a doctor in Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, was still treating a stream of patients wounded by airstrikes. His hospital, like others, has reached capacity and is running on generators with around a week's worth of fuel supply left. Abu Safiya, who also works with the international nonprofit MedGlobal, said his hospital is treating complex injuries, with missing limbs and full body burns. ""Most of the injured, they're all children, all children,"" he told NPR in a voice message. (Airstrikes have disrupted phone connectivity in Gaza. ) ""There's been evacuation orders. People have children, elderly. Where should they go?""There are also dwindling food and water supplies. The majority of Palestinians in Gaza no longer have access to safe drinking water, not even bottled water, said Hastings, the United Nations' resident coordinator for the Palestinian territories. U. S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's arrival in Israel on Friday came on the heels of Thursday's visit by U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. By Friday, Blinken had traveled to Jordan, where he met with King Abdullah II and, later, with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, in the Jordanian capital of Amman. Blinken is visiting five Arab states over the next few days as he tries to contain the conflict in Gaza to prevent it from becoming regional. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Thursday that his country has the right to defend itself. ""I agree there are many, many Palestinians who don't agree to this,"" he told reporters. ""But unfortunately, in their homes there are missiles shooting at us, [at] my children, on the entire nation of Israel. We have to defend ourselves. ""The U. S. diplomatic efforts come as concerns grow that the chaos — the worst outbreak of violence in Israel and Gaza in recent memory — could spread to the occupied West Bank. It already has: 49 Palestinians have died in the region since Saturday, either in clashes with Israeli security forces or Jewish settlers, and more than 950 Palestinians have been wounded there. North of the West Bank, a Reuters journalist was killed on Friday in southern Lebanon. At least six other journalists from Reuters, AFP and Al Jazeera were injured, according to the news agencies. Reuters said it's investigating the incident. U. N. Secretary-General António Guterres expressed his condolences to the families of the journalists, who he said are unfortunately paying with their lives. ""I want to say how much this demonstrates the enormous risk of spillover of this conflict, namely in relation to Lebanon,"" Guterres told reporters. Charter flights to evacuate U. S. citizens who remain in Israel began Friday. Other countries, such as China, France and the United Kingdom, have also reported citizens killed or missing in the conflict. Diplomatic conversations are happening about how citizens from the U. S. and other countries could have safe passage out of Gaza. Meanwhile, Hamas' military wing, Ezzedin al-Qassam Brigades, said 13 hostages, among them foreigners, were killed in Israeli strikes in different locations in Gaza over the past 24 hours. That brings to 17 the number that the group says were killed by Israeli fire since their abduction Saturday. At least 27 U. S. citizens were killed in the weekend's Hamas attacks, the White House said Friday. Another 14 Americans are currently unaccounted for. On Friday, President Biden held a call with the families of the 14 Americans who are missing, along with U. S. hostage envoy Roger Carstens and other senior officials. A small number of the unaccounted-for Americans are believed to be held hostage. Aya Batrawy reported from Jerusalem; Becky Sullivan reported from Washington, D. C.

360,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/13/1205235922/help-israel-gaza-humanitarian-organizations,"Officials and aid groups warn of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Israel and Gaza, where escalating violence has already killed thousands of people and wounded and displaced many others. Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel on Saturday, firing rockets from Gaza and infiltrating the country by paraglider, motorbike and boat. They gunned down Israelis in multiple locations, including residential communities and a techno music festival, in the deadliest day for Jewish civilians since the Holocaust.  Israel retaliated immediately, including by putting Gaza — which is home to 2. 3 million Palestinians — under full siege, cutting off its supply of fuel, electricity and food. It has also unleashed heavy bombardments, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. Officials say about one-tenth of its total population is internally displaced. Residents are unable to leave Gaza, since the only border crossing to Egypt is closed after being hit by Israeli air strikes. That also means basic necessities and emergency relief can't get in. The International Committee of the Red Cross warned on Thursday that ""without electricity, hospitals risk turning into morgues. "" The United Nations, the U. S. , and others have called for a humanitarian corridor to be established. Egypt, the U. S. and Israel are in ongoing discussions about that, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk called on Palestinian armed groups to release all hostages and for all parties to respect international human rights law and stop targeting civilians. ""We are faced with an explosive powder keg situation,"" he said in a statement. ""We know how this plays out, time and time again – the loss of Israeli and Palestinian lives and incalculable suffering inflicted on both communities. "" As the world watches, many people may be looking to support humanitarian efforts on the ground. Below are some of the organizations doing that work. Social media is awash with misinformation about the Israel-Hamas conflict, so it's especially important to verify that your money is going to organizations that are legitimate as well as effective. The Federal Trade Commission recommends searching charities' names alongside ""complaint,"" ""review,"" ""rating"" and ""scam"" to see if any red flags come up. Another red flag would be if their website doesn't have detailed information about its mission and programs, or if you don't get a receipt after donating. You can also run a search on one of several websites that review charities' track records, like CharityWatch and Charity Navigator. Some also compile lists of highly-rated charities responding to specific crises. To maximize the impact of your donation, prioritize giving to organizations that already have a presence on the ground and will stay involved in the long-term, experts told NPR. ActionAid is an international network dedicated to ""building a just, equitable, and sustainable world in solidarity with communities on the frontlines of poverty and injustice,"" with a presence in Palestinian territories since 2007. The group is calling for the safe passage of humanitarian aid to those who need it the most, and has set up an emergency response fund that it says will be used to deliver essential relief as soon as possible and sustain long-term disaster preparedness around the world. Anera addresses the development and relief needs of refugees and others hurt by conflicts in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon and Jordan. It's working to provide humanitarian relief to Palestinians and residents of East Jerusalem. According to its website, $30 can provide the Central Blood Bank Society in Gaza with 16 bags, $80 will provide a hygiene kit for two displaced families, $100 can provide a displaced family with enough food for seven to 10 days, and $200 will provide food to two families. Doctors without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) describes itself as an ""independent and impartial humanitarian organization"" that delivers emergency medical care in places that need it. It does not currently run medical programs in Israel — citing its strong emergency and health systems — but says it has offered support to Israeli hospitals treating a high number of casualties. It does provide medical care in Gaza and is focused on meeting immediate emergency needs there, including donating medical supplies. The International Committee of the Red Cross is a ""neutral, independent humanitarian organization"" that responds to help people harmed by armed conflict and disasters in conflict zones. The group says it immediately offered help to both sides. It's donated medical supplies to Gaza and is working with authorities to help identify missing people. It's working with Israel's Magen David Adom and the Palestine Red Crescent Society to help people who are wounded, sick and in need. International Rescue Committee works in more than 40 countries and 28 U. S. cities to help people affected by humanitarian crises, in the short- and long-term. It issued a statement condemning the toll of the violence across Israel and Gaza, and said it is ""assessing needs on the ground and our capacity to ensure critical, life-saving humanitarian relief reaches affected civilian populations. "" IsraAID is the largest humanitarian aid organization in Israel, and has responded to global disasters in over 50 countries. It's collecting donations through its Emergency Response Fund, and says its plans will develop as needs on the ground evolve. So far, it's working local partners to: coordinate humanitarian activities in shelters housing evacuees from the Gaza border region, operate child-friendly spaces where kids can play and process, distribute resilience kits with stress relief activities for kids and families, train local teams on self-care and stress relief and train local mental health specialists on emergency-specific psychosocial support. The Jewish Agency for Israel is a global nonprofit dedicated to securing ""a vibrant Jewish future. "" Its Fund for Victims of Terror provides immediate financial assistance to victims and their families. The group says it has disbursed hundreds of grants since the violence started, with representatives delivering checks of more than $1,000 within 48 hours of an event. It anticipates distributing more, as well as following up with long-term recovery and rehabilitative support. The Jewish Federations of North America represents nearly 400 Jewish communities in the U. S. and Canada, and raises money to support the Jewish community on the continent and around the world. It says it's working with core partners to support victims of terror, help rebuild infrastructure and address ""the unprecedented levels of trauma"" caused by the attack. It launched a $500 million campaign to support Israelis, with funding to be divided between urgent humanitarian needs and long-term rebuilding and rehabilitation. The group said Thursday it's already allocated $10 million to 20 organizations providing emergency relief and support in Israel. Magen David Adom is Israel's national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance and blood bank service — the equivalent of a Red Cross. It says donations will be used to make sure responders and volunteers have all the training, equipment and medical supplies (including blood) to treat injured people. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that Bloomberg Philanthropies will match all donations to Magen David Adom. Middle East Children's Alliance is a nonprofit dedicated to children's rights in the Middle East, and supports dozens of community projects for Palestinian children. It says its team and partners are preparing to procure medical supplies for hospitals as well as provide emergency assistance to families who have fled their homes. Donations will go to provide medical aid, clean water, food and psychological support, it says. Palestine Children's Relief Fund provides medical and humanitarian relief to Arab children, regardless of nationality or religion, and has had a presence in Gaza for some 30 years. It says donations mean access to medical care, mental health support and essential supplies for kids in Gaza. Save the Children says it's disbursed $1 million from its emergency fund to help its teams respond to lifesaving needs in both Israel and Gaza ""when it is safe to do so. "" The NGO says its teams and their families are bracing for what's next, knowing that children have ""never emerged unscathed"" — both in terms of their physical and mental health. Donations to its Children's Emergency Fund will go towards warm blankets, nutritious food, health care and other supports. United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East provides assistance and protection for Palestinian refugees. It says it is urgently seeking $104 million to support its ""multi-sectoral humanitarian response over the coming 90 days. "" Those funds will cover immediate food, non-food, health, shelter and protection needs of up to 250,000 people seeking shelter across the Gaza Strip. It says its current funding is only enough to cover regular services in the region through October. Eleven UNRWA staff and personnel have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Saturday. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) works in over 190 countries and territories to protect children's lives and rights. Spokesperson James Elder said 1. 1 million children were already in need of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank before the current escalation of violence. UNICEF and its partners are on the ground in Gaza delivering medical supplies and fuel, as well as mental health and psychosocial support, he added.

361,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/13/1205671760/palestinian-israeli-city,"In Rahat, an Israeli city about twenty miles from the border with Gaza, the sound of military planes is constant overhead. On the day we arrived, people were in mourning. Sheikh Hassan Abu Ghalyun was returning from a burial when he welcomed us to Rahat. He is the tribal reconciliation chief in this city. His Bedouin courthouse is an airy, carpeted tent on the roadside. From here, he solves feuds and resolves marital disputes. But this war is something he can't solve. ""Both sides are losing. No one wins in a war. People only lose in a war,"" Abu Ghalyun told NPR's Morning Edition through an interpreter. The burial was for Tariq Mohammed, who was killed when Hamas attacked on October 7. In total, 17 people were killed in this Palestinian Bedouin community in Israel. One entire family lost their lives. They lived in a tent in an unrecognized community closer to the Gaza border. Abu Ghalyun said a rocket fell nearby, and the family's four children left their tent to see what was going on. ""Just as they were returning to their tent, another rocket came and killed them,"" he said. Hamas didn't seem to discriminate among its victims. The more than 1,400 people killed included Jewish people, Arabs, women and children. Here in Rahat, the bonds of family stretch across divided lands. Residents here suffer loss, fear and anger on all sides of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Abu Ghalyun has relatives in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. ""My heart is bleeding for the ones on the east side or the ones on the west side,"" he said. ""All of them are the sons of Adam. ""He took us to meet the family of Tariq Mohammed, the man killed by Hamas. In a concrete room with a corrugated tin roof, men were gathered to mourn with his father, Hamd El Kamalat. 35-year-old Mohammed was a garbage collector living on the Gaza envelope. He was among many killed in the nearby town of Ofakim, home to a largely Sephardic Jewish community, when Hamas militants breached the border. ""They shot him,"" Hamd El Kamalat said. He was reluctant to name his son's attackers or speak about how he felt. ""All of us feel the same. This is not a situation that only involves me. It involves everybody,"" explained El Kamalat. He pointed in the air, paused, then looked down at the concrete floor. ""I have pain,"" he added. The men come from one extended family, the Kamalats. Some live in Israel, and some live in Gaza. The Palestinian enclave is under siege by Israel, with civilians cut off from food, water, electricity and fuel. Israel has ordered more than one million people to leave the north of Gaza. And it says it is prepared to launch an air, ground and naval offensive in retaliation for the brutal assault by Hamas militants on October 7. Communication is spotty. And already around 3,000 people have been killed by retaliatory Israeli airstrikes, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. So, in this room in Rahat, news from Gaza was scarce. Mohamed El Kamalat, sitting nearby, held up his phone. From Israel, he had been trying to reach his family. ""There, we don't know if they're alive or dead. And here, we have a state of war,"" he said. With families living on both sides of the conflict, many in Rahat get quiet when you ask them who is at fault. They don't want to criticize Hamas, which rules the Gaza strip, because they have family there and members of their community are being held hostage. Nor do they cast blame on the government here in Israel, where they live and are citizens. So, there's a lot that's left unsaid. Mohamed El Kamalat, though, blames all. ""The leadership in Israel and the leadership in Palestine. These are the two entities I blame,"" he said. For Mohamed El Kamalat, the responsibility lies with Hamas, whose attack on Israel was a clear declaration of war, as well as Israel's far right government, which has carried out a policy of annexation and eviction of Palestinians in occupied territories that has killed any possibility of a two-state solution. We said goodbye to the men, when Tariq's mother, Karima Kamalat, arrived. ""When we found out he was dead we wanted to go see him,"" she said. ""There were dead bodies everywhere. And no one was allowed to reach that area. ""After three days, she was allowed to go, and she found her son among the bodies. He was taken to the morgue. It was two days later, on the day we visited them, that the family could finally bury him. ""There were too many dead bodies. So it took them a while to release his body,"" she said. As we left, there was an audible reminder of the war near us, as we heard rockets being fired by Hamas. In Rahat there is only one shelter, a sign of the lack of infrastructure in this Palestinian Israeli city. So everyone stood outside in the open and waited until the booms stopped.

363,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/12/1205484240/israel-gaza-bombardment-humanitarian-crisis,"JERUSALEM — The pleas from inside Gaza over Israel's relentless bombardments have plunged the densely populated areas into a humanitarian crisis. The enclave now is under complete siege. Israel has cut off food, water, fuel and electricity in retaliation for the attack Hamas carried out in Israel's southern towns. The territory's main power plant ran out of fuel Wednesday, plunging Gaza's 2. 3 million residents into darkness. Videos from inside Gaza show entire blocks reduced to rubble and children being pulled from the debris. Some 24 families have been wiped out since Saturday. The infrastructure, already weakened by a 16-year blockade and four previous wars since 2008, is now being crushed. It's something Palestinians say they've never seen before. ""The airstrikes are everywhere, the bombs are everywhere, the smell of death is everywhere,"" said Wajeh Abu Zarefeh, a journalist in Gaza. Last night he found himself stranded in the darkness outside the main hospital. Abu Zarefeh says it was too dark for people to move, and fuel is running out for transportation. ""We are trying to survive,"" he said. ""The Israeli attacks are at every inch of the Gaza Strip so there are no safe places, nowhere to escape and to run. ""The war was sparked by a surprise attack from Hamas that saw fighters flow into Israel on trucks and on paragliders. It has left at least 1,300 people dead in one of the worst attacks in Israel's history. Israel's retaliatory airstrikes have killed almost as many Palestinians in Gaza in six days of war. More than half are women and children. Many are still buried under the rubble. Meanwhile, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has said this is just the start of what's to come. The country is preparing for a ground invasion. It's a reaction that the Israeli human rights organization B'tselem is calling a ""criminal policy of revenge. "" The International Committee of the Red Cross says the lifeline for Gaza is beginning to fade. The journalist Abu Zarafeh said his neighborhood is too dangerous to go back to now. He's lost touch with some of his children because communications were cut off. ""This conflict is between Hamas and Israel. So why is Israel destroying our homes? It is destroying whole neighborhoods?"" Abu Zarafeh said. ""This is collective punishment. ""His story is the story of every family in Gaza right now. They flee one bombarded area only to find the airstrikes following them to the next neighborhood and then the next. It's a nightmare NPR's producer in Gaza, Anas Baba, is living. As he tries to cover this war for the world, he's also trying to survive it.  He tried to evacuate his family from their home. ""I took them from the house, and I started to just think, where am I going to take them? Where am I going to hide them? Is there any safe place in Gaza?"" he said over a scratchy phone line. Finally he just gave up and took them back home. There used to be some safe places to seek shelter, routes you could take out of danger. But Palestinians inside Gaza say not this time. ""This is a different war, this is a different [Israel Defense Forces,]"" he said. ""This is not the same bombing that we used to see before. ""There are no humanitarian corridors to bring badly needed aid inside and no open border crossings. The passage into Egypt has been struck at least three times. Even aid workers haven't been spared. The United Nations Palestinian refugee agency says 11 of its staff members were killed, some in their homes with their families. Eighteen of their facilities have been damaged, including schools where many of the more than 330,000 people that are displaced are sheltering. Among the only places left that still have generator power are the hospitals. Abu Zarefeh says those will run out sometime today. ""Everybody is thinking about how to stay alive,"" he said.

364,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/12/1204881032/hamas-israel-attack-palestinians,"The surprise attack on Israel by Hamas on Oct. 7 has brought the militant group back into the spotlight. In the attack, Hamas fighters flew paragliders from Gaza and used bulldozers to poke gaping holes in a barrier fence to gain access to Israeli territory. They killed more than 1,000 people and seized at least 100 hostages. Hamas' attack was unprecedented. A senior Hamas official tells NPR that its planning was kept a close secret. Since Hamas' formation more than three decades ago, the armed, hard-line Islamist group has been a major presence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Here are some key points:Hamas was formed in 1987 at the start of the first Palestinian uprising, or intifada, against Israel. It is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Sunni Islamist group that first formed in Egypt. Hamas, the Arabic acronym for ""Islamic Resistance Movement,"" wants to create a Palestinian state. It rejects any peace deal with Israel, which it refuses to recognize. It is considered a terrorist organization by Israel, the U. S. and a number of other Western countries. ""Hamas has only one agenda, to destroy Israel and to murder Jews,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters Thursday at a press conference in Israel. The organization's political chief is Ismail Haniyeh, who is based in Doha, Qatar. He took over from longtime leader Khaled Meshaal. The U. S. State Department has designated Haniyeh a terrorist, noting his ""close links"" with Hamas' military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. The military wing is currently overseen by Marwan Issa, reportedly born in a Gaza Strip refugee camp, and Mohammed Deif, who is said to be the mastermind of the latest assault on Israel. Israel has previously tried to assassinate Deif. The Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades have been responsible for numerous attacks against Israel, including bombings and rocket attacks, since the 1990s. The State Department says Iran provides money and weapons to Hamas. The Islamist group has long been active in the Gaza Strip, a tiny Palestinian exclave situated on the Mediterranean Sea and hemmed in by Israel and Egypt. It also maintains a presence — and popularity — in the West Bank. In 2006, Hamas won legislative elections in Gaza and the West Bank but refused to join a coalition government with the opposition Fatah party — a key constituent of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, or PLO. Hamas later seized control of the Gaza Strip. In response to attacks by Hamas and Lebanon-based Hezbollah, also supported by Iran, Israel has fortified schools and bus stops, instituted a coded alarm system, deployed a sophisticated Iron Dome missile shield and constructed a high-tech fence to stop incursions across its border with Gaza. It also imposed a punishing economic blockade and restricted movement between the Gaza Strip and Israel. Hamas responded by constructing a series of smuggling tunnels. Most experts agree the surprise attack was a well-orchestrated offensive that required considerable planning. Unsurprisingly, it has triggered a massive retaliation, with Israel launching airstrikes deep into Gaza and vowing a ""complete siege. ""So, what did Hamas hope to accomplish?In an interview with NPR, Ali Barakeh, a senior Hamas official based in Lebanon, said the Oct. 7 attack came in response to ""Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people in Jerusalem and the West Bank"" and to ""break the blockade on the Gaza Strip. "" He said it was also meant to free thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Well before the latest attack on Israel, Hamas said it wanted to resist Israeli occupation and to seek revenge for Israel's 2021 raid on Islam's third-holiest site, Al-Aqsa Mosque, in the Old City of Jerusalem. Conditions in the Gaza Strip have worsened since the blockade was imposed in 2007. Most Gazans live in poverty and are dependent on aid. Unemployment is high. For many in Hamas, opposing Israel is the organization's reason for existing, says Jonathan Panikoff, director of the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council. ""There's a core constituency in Hamas that this is what they live for . . . what they're trained for, what they want to be doing. ""It may also be a case of Hamas trying to maintain relevance and its leaders looking over their shoulders — concerned that they still need to show they can bring the fight to Israel, says Panikoff, who is a former deputy national intelligence officer for the Middle East. ""You have even more militant jihadist groups in in the Gaza Strip. You don't want [defections] to those groups,"" he says. The strike by Hamas could also serve as a touchstone for others who want to fight against Israel, says C. Ross Anthony, a senior economist at Rand Corp. and co-author of Alternatives in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. ""They were able to capture people and kill Israelis in a way they never had before,"" he says. ""So that will inspire people in the Middle East, unfortunately, and probably some of the people on the West Bank. ""Bilal Saab, a former Pentagon official who is now a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, says he doesn't think Hamas expected the attack to lead to an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank or other territorial concessions. Instead, the hostages Hamas seized during the operation are a means to an end, he says, giving the extremist group ""bargaining space with the Israelis"" for the release of some or all of the thousands of Palestinians in Israeli jails. The hostages will ""significantly complicate [military] operations for the Israelis,"" Panikoff says. Dennis Jett, a retired U. S. ambassador and professor of international affairs at Pennsylvania State University, says Hamas learned an important lesson after abducting Israel Defense Forces soldier Gilad Shalit in 2006. Five years later, Shalit was turned over in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian and Arab-Israeli prisoners held by Israel. ""That,"" Jett says, ""wasn't lost on Hamas. ""Following the 2021 Israeli-Gaza conflict, an opinion poll conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in the West Bank and Gaza Strip showed a dramatic surge in support for Hamas. In the poll, 53% of the 1,200 Palestinians surveyed said they believed Hamas is ""most deserving of representing and leading the Palestinian people. "" By contrast, just 14% said the same of Fatah. Israel has had a complicated past with Hamas — at certain times simply hoping to contain the extremist group, at other times attacking the group, and even seemingly acquiescing to its control of Gaza, some experts say. It has fought several wars with the group since 2007, the most recent in 2021. Some Israelis are blaming Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for emboldening Hamas by focusing disproportionately on the West Bank and engaging in policies that have served to weaken the Palestinian Authority. ""Hamas has been a problem for Israelis for a long time, going back to their assumption of power in Gaza,"" says Ray Takeyh, a senior fellow in Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""And the Israelis have had different ways of dealing with it. They have had a blockade. They have tried to isolate it periodically. They have had military incursions back and forth between the two parties. ""In 2014, after the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers by Hamas-affiliated militants in the West Bank, Israel Defense Forces arrested hundreds of Hamas militants in the territory. In response, Hamas stepped up rocket attacks from Gaza, triggering a weeks-long war that killed dozens of Israeli soldiers and more than 2,000 Palestinians, including many civilians. The 2021 Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip lasted a dozen days and resulted in the deaths of more than 250 Palestinians. After the conflict, Israel thought it had denuded Hamas and limited its potential for continued violence, Panikoff says. Israel, he says, ""had a policy colloquially known as mowing the grass. Going after Hamas, getting a lot of the rockets, [going after] their militant leaders, either killing them or capturing them. ""More recently, however, Israel ""hoped that by loosening the embargo and giving more work permits to Hamas, to the Gazans to come back or forth for work, that would give Hamas some cover incentive for tempering its militancy,"" Takeyh says. ""This battle was very secretive; the planning and execution were kept secret,"" Hamas representative Barakeh tells NPR. ""The zero hour was confidential, and no one outside of Hamas knew about it. ""In the lead-up to the Oct. 7 attack, Hamas made an effort to throw Israeli officials off the scent, including ""two years of subterfuge by Hamas that involved keeping its military plans under wraps and convincing Israel it did not want a fight,"" according to Reuters. Israel thought it was containing a ""war-weary Hamas,"" while all the while Hamas fighters were ""being trained and drilled, often in plain sight,"" the news agency said, quoting an unidentified Hamas source. ""So the Israelis were not worried about what Hamas was going to do, but this was all part of the [Hamas] plan, and that's why [the Israelis] had all their eyes on what was happening in the West Bank,"" says Saab, of the Middle East Institute. Jett of Pennsylvania State University says in addition to turning its attention away from Gaza and toward the West Bank, Israel was also overly confident of the defenses it had put in place against a Hamas attack. ""They built this very expensive wall with an Iron Dome missile system, and the wall failed and it was not heavily manned because they have concentrated a lot of effort in suppressing people in the West Bank,"" he says. ""And the Iron Dome was overwhelmed. ""There is disagreement among experts as to the extent of Iran's possible involvement in Saturday's surprise attack on Israel. Iran has denied direct involvement in the Hamas attack. And Hamas' Barakeh tells NPR that while ""Iran knows that Hamas fights Israel and offers us support, which we do not deny . . . we don't take orders from anyone. In Hamas, specifically the Qassam Brigades, we were the ones who planned this operation, determined the zero hour, and once the operation began, we immediately informed all allies and friends. There was no prior coordination regarding this operation. ""Training for the attack, Barakeh says, ""took place in the Gaza Strip. Everything in Gaza, and manufacturing is in Gaza. ""But there's little doubt Tehran provided at least indirect support and ""is heavily involved,"" Jett believes. ""It has had relationships with both Hamas and Hezbollah for years and supported them in all sorts of ways,"" he says. ""I think Hamas couldn't have done this without extensive training, arms and support from Iran. ""Panikoff believes that Hamas would probably have required ""Iranian acquiescence"" for such an operation, but says it's unclear whether Tehran would have helped with specific planning. Saab thinks it's likely Hamas itself was largely responsible for planning and carrying out the attack. ""They certainly have gotten a lot of advice in terms of how to rehearse. And they certainly got a lot of equipment [from Iran] over the years. But I would say this is [was a] local decision,"" he says. Israel has already begun large-scale retaliatory airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, killing hundreds of people and laying waste to sections of the territory. That is likely to continue and intensify. ""Israel is going to inflict massive punishment on Gaza in retribution. And this thing is, it'll take weeks for it to end,"" says Jett. If Hezbollah launches more than symbolic rocket attacks from southern Lebanon, there's also the possibility of escalation, Jett says. ""Israel is going to continue to attack anything that it can identify as related to Hamas,"" he adds. In that climate, he says, there's almost no prospect of a diplomatic solution. Barakeh, the Hamas official, tells NPR, ""There are promises from our allies that they will not leave us alone,"" but declined to provide details, saying, ""There's no need to reveal all the cards now, so the enemy won't know. ""Takeyh says Israel ""seems to be preparing for a ground attack"" and that its intent will likely be to dismantle Hamas altogether, meaning thousands more Gazans will lose their lives and their homes. And that, he says, raises even more difficult questions about Gaza's future. ""Then the question is who governs Gaza? What happens to it? Because I think they would want to dislodge Hamas, but not necessarily to govern Gaza themselves,"" he says.

365,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/12/1205255594/israel-gaza-hamas-war-iron-dome-defense-palestinians,"Some of the ways in which Hamas initially attacked Israel over the weekend — taking down communication towers with improvised explosives, paragliding over the border and gunning down civilians — subverted one of Israel's strongest defenses: its Iron Dome. First deployed in 2011, the Iron Dome is a network of radar detectors and missile launchers that work together to intercept incoming rockets. The highly sophisticated, multibillion-dollar defense system has been under constant redevelopment since its inception in the early 2000s. Here's how it works, who funds it and why we don't see it in other parts of the world. The Iron Dome is a mobile air defense system designed to protect against short-range rockets. It was conceived in the early 2000s and became operational in 2011. Three parts make it work, says Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. First, there's the radar. When a rocket is launched into Israel, the system detects it and collects data on its flight path. Second, that information is sent to a computer that calculates where that rocket is going. ""For rockets and artillery, for ballistic missiles, it's pretty predictable. So if you see something traveling on a particular arc, you kind of know where it's going to be going on the rest of its trajectory. You also know where it's going to end up,"" Karako told NPR. Third, if the system calculates that the rocket is going to land in a populated area or a place of strategic importance, it activates the last piece of the system — the launcher — which fires Tamir interceptors to collide with the rocket midair. ""If a rocket's going off course and is just going to land in the Negev desert, they're just going to let that one go,"" Karako explained. The system is expensive — each missile it launches costs about $40,000 to $50,000 — and the U. S. has poured billions of dollars into its development and maintenance (more on that in a moment). More than 5,000 rockets have been launched into Israel since the attacks from Hamas began Saturday, according to the Israeli military, which says the Iron Dome successfully neutralized most of them. In the past, the Israel Defense Forces has said the Iron Dome's success rate is about 90% to 97% in its capacity to seek out and protect civilians from incoming weapons. And as Karako explains, the aim of the Iron Dome isn't necessarily perfection. ""The Iron Dome, in particular, is kind of the poster child for the 'good enough' high success rate,"" he said. ""Their approach to acquisition has been not the most exquisite and most expensive interceptor, for the perfect interceptor rate — but rather, large quantities of interceptors that are lower cost and good enough to get after the threats. ""Development for the Iron Dome began in Israel in 2006, in response to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. The project was spearheaded by RAFAEL Advanced Defense Systems, a state-run defense firm that would spend the next five years fine-tuning the technology. The U. S. has invested nearly $3 billion into its launchers, interceptors and general maintenance, according to a Congressional Research Service report. And there is likely more U. S. aid in the pipeline, with President Biden saying on Tuesday that the federal government is ""surging additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors to replenish Iron Dome. ""In addition to Biden's pledge, a group of U. S. lawmakers in the House introduced a bipartisan bill this week that would appropriate an additional $2 billion to help bolster the Iron Dome. Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N. J. , said the move would be ""critical to increasing American security assistance for Israel's missile defense system, which is saving millions of innocent lives. ""Thanks in part to the investment and collaboration with Israel on the Iron Dome, the U. S. has two Iron Dome batteries. The Ukrainian government has made a number of requests for Israeli-made defense systems — including the Iron Dome — since Russia invaded in February 2022. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the Israeli Knesset in March 2022, stating: ""Everyone in Israel knows that your missile defense is the best . . . and you can definitely help us protect our lives, the lives of Ukrainians, the lives of Ukrainian Jews. ""Yet in June of this year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that Israel would not be sharing technology or insight on its missile defense system with Ukraine, citing concerns that ""if that system were to fall in the hands of Iran, then millions of Israelis would be left defenseless and imperiled. ""But Karako says Israel's exclusive use of this technology could change. ""There are other countries in Europe and elsewhere in the world that are certainly looking at this . . . for its relatively lower cost, for its sooner availability and for its proven record.

366,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/12/1205357394/american-family-trapped-gaza,"Israel is intensifying air strikes on Gaza after the weekend's surprise air, land and sea attack by Hamas, in which militants killed 1,300 Israelis and took some 150 as hostages. Israel has retaliated by putting the Gaza Strip under siege, cutting off access to food, water, fuel and electricity for its 2. 3 million residents. It's also carrying out heavy bombardments across the territory, killing at least 1,350 people and internally displacing hundreds of thousands of others. People in Gaza can't leave, since the borders are sealed. The Rafah border crossing, the only path into Egypt, is closed after being hit by multiple Israeli strikes. That also means that outside aid, as well as basic necessities, can't get in. The Biden administration is urging Israel — publicly and privately — to get humanitarian supplies into Gaza. It's also trying to secure the release of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas, which include an unknown number of Americans. A senior U. S. official told NPR that it's also working to get approximately 400-600 U. S. citizens out of Gaza, where roughly 100 of them have contacted the embassy for help. One of them is Wafaa Abuzayda, who is with her family including her one-year-old son. The 30-year-old grew up in Gaza, but hadn't been back since moving to the U. S. seven years ago. Abuzayda and her husband, who is American, had gone back and forth about when exactly to visit. ""We changed our tickets like three to four times . . . and then we decided to come to Gaza at this time,"" she said. ""And our short vacation just turned into a nightmare. "" For all the latest developments on this story, listen live to Morning Edition now. Abuzayda, her husband Abood and their one-and-a-half year old son Yousef traveled from Massachusetts for what was supposed to be a two-week trip. They don't know when they'll be able to go home — and not for lack of trying. Abuzayda told Morning Edition's Leila Fadel that she called the U. S. embassy for help multiple times a day starting immediately after the attack on Saturday. But they told her repeatedly that they didn't have any updates. Then she tried the embassy in Cairo, to no avail. ""We tell them we're running out of milk, diapers, we're not safe, we're citizens — they're not doing anything,"" she said. ""And in the meantime they keep posting stuff about the U. S. citizens in Israel. Every five minutes they keep reminding the people in Israel to get out of Israel. "" At least 22 U. S. citizens died in the fighting in Israel and at least 17 others are unaccounted for, U. S. officials said Wednesday. And there are many others struggling to leave, since major U. S. airlines have halted flights in and out of the country. The total number is unknown, but New York Rep. Mike Lawler said his district alone has  ""hundreds of constituents in Israel trying to get home. "" The U. S. increased the travel advisory for Israel and the West Bank on Wednesday to level three, or ""reconsider travel. "" The advisory for Gaza remains at level four, ""do not travel. "" The State Department warns that it's unable to provide ""routine or emergency services"" to U. S. citizens in Gaza, since U. S. government employees are prohibited from traveling there. Right now no one can get in or out. Abuzayda, who is staying at her parents' house with other relatives, said her sister-in-law and her three kids had tried to cross the Rafah border, but they had to turn back after it came under an Israeli airstrike. Nowhere in Gaza is safe from bombardment, Abuzayda said. There is no electricity. Families are using generators sparingly if they have fuel left — Abuzayda says she can only charge her phone for several hours at a time every few days. The sporadic access to communication means they could lose their connection to the outside world at any moment. She said it's not safe inside or outside. The markets themselves are running low on supplies. She's trying to make the most of the milk and diapers she has left — and keep Yousef not only safe but in good spirits. ""The hardest feeling ever is to hide your fear and show the opposite, just to keep my son positive,"" she said. ""Because he doesn't understand anything, he thinks this is a fireworks. And every time I tell him, while I'm crying, 'okay mommy, clap clap this is a fireworks, it's nothing. ' Sometimes he will jump, he will be scared and freaking out if I'm not next to him. "" Abuzayda is holding out hope that officials will make a safe path for civilians to leave Gaza through the Rafah border and into Egypt. The Biden administration is discussing the prospect with Egypt and Israel, but had not made any progress as of Wednesday. When asked what she wants the U. S. government to hear, Abuzayda made an emotional plea over the airwaves. ""Please, please save us,"" she said, her voice strained. ""Please. I have a one-and-a-half year old, I got him after six times of IVF . . . We have been trying to call the embassy since Saturday. Nobody's helping, nobody's getting back to us. Please save us.

Kfar Aza, Be'eri, Nahal Oz, Magen — all of them small, sleepy kibbutzim, the Hebrew plural for kibbutz, whose names have been printed across newspaper headlines and TV chyrons since becoming the sites of atrocities and warfare. Kibbutz residents have been killed and taken hostage at a scale that has shocked those who escaped unscathed. The kibbutz is a uniquely Israeli phenomenon with a significant cultural legacy and an important role in the nation's history. Here's what to know. The word itself means ""gathering"" in Hebrew. Kibbutzim are a communal living situation unique to Israel. There are about 270 kibbutzim dotted across Israel. At their heart, kibbutzim are small towns — typically with somewhere between 100 and 1,000 residents — historically centered around collective farms. In recent decades, some have come to thrive on modern industry and tourism. Central to the kibbutz are roots in socialist and Marxist ideas about collective living. Early kibbutzim were exercises in radical democracy, said David Leach, author of the book Chasing Utopia: The Future of the Kibbutz in a Divided Israel. ""There was no private property. They had their meals together in many cases. They raised their children communally,"" Leach said. ""I would say they are considered one of the most successful experiments in voluntary socialism,"" said Ran Abramitzky, a professor of economics at Stanford University. ""Jewish immigrants who founded kibbutzim rejected capitalism and wanted to form a more socialist society. ""Kibbutz residents have never made up a majority of Israel's residents. (Currently, less than 3% of Israel's population live on one. ) Despite their small numbers, kibbutzim have had outsized cultural and political influence on Israel for much of its history, with many politicians, military leaders, intellectuals and artists all coming from kibbutzim. Politics in kibbutzim are associated with the left-wing and peace solutions. The first kibbutz was established in 1910, and over the decades that followed, dozens were formed across the territory that would become Israel. Historically, many were formed by young Jews from eastern Europe who believed in the Zionist mission of forming a Jewish homeland in Palestine, which was once part of the Ottoman Empire and later under British control. Others came to escape antisemitism and, later, the Holocaust. ""The kibbutz was for them more like an extended family. They provided safety nets,"" said Abramitzky, who also authored the book The Mystery of the Kibbutz: Egalitarian Principles in a Capitalist World. Before the formation of the state of Israel, the kibbutz played an important role in the Zionist mission of state-building. In the 1930s and 1940s, as it became clear that the creation of a Jewish state was likely, some kibbutzim were placed strategically near regions like Gaza in order to help stake the future claim. ""If you look at any map of Israel, you can almost connect the dots around the border regions, and there will be kibbutzim,"" said Leach, who is also a professor of writing at the University of Victoria in Canada. That dual purpose fed the early stereotype of a kibbutz resident, or a kibbutznik, as a combination of farmer and fighter — someone who was there to both ""farm the land but also establish its borders and defend it,"" Leach said. Most kibbutzim have given up the traditional systems of communal living. Typically, residents with jobs keep their own income, and parents raise their own children. They are largely considered to be quiet, idyllic places to live, said Abramitzky. Many have aging populations. ""It's this picturesque village in the countryside, with small apartments surrounded by these lush green walking paths, swimming pool, cultural centers, the dining hall,"" he said. ""It's typically — ironically — an incredibly peaceful and safe place. "" While residents are still often left-leaning, kibbutzim are increasingly politically diverse, said Leach of the University of Victoria. ""Even though you have people who are more oriented toward peace and reconciliation, others have their attitudes hardening. And that's only going to happen more after the recent attacks,"" he said. In kibbutzim located close to the border with Gaza, rockets from Hamas had long been a semiregular part of life. But now, the small communities within eyeshot of Gaza have been subjected to more violence than residents ever imagined. The streets of tiny Nahal Oz were filled with bodies after Israeli soldiers cleared the area of Hamas fighters, Israeli officials say. The Israeli military is using the farming community Kfar Aza as a staging ground for operations. And in Be'eri, a kibbutz located a few miles southeast of Gaza with just over 1,000 residents, Israeli authorities say more than 100 people were killed and others kidnapped. One of the missing residents was Vivian Silver, 74, a woman who had spent her retirement pursuing peace in the region, her son Yonatan Zeigen told NPR. ""She would drive sick Palestinians from Gaza to Israeli hospitals. So apart from being a wonderful mother and grandmother, that was her essence,"" Zeigen said.",npr_articles/article_367.txt,npr_results/article_367.txt.json

N. spokesman said. The Israeli order came late Thursday night and gave 24 hours for the evacuation to take place. The announcement affects a region that is home to about 1. 1 million people. The evacuation order affects half of Gaza's population. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were already displaced before this order, many sheltering in U. N. -run schools. The entire territory is under full Israeli siege, with no one allowed out and no fuel, food or even water allowed in. The main Gaza power plant has completely shut. In a statement released to the news media, U. N. officials pushed back on the Israeli directive. ""The United Nations considers it impossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences,"" the U. N. said. The Israeli order applied to all U. N. staff and those sheltered in U. N. facilities – including schools, health centers and clinics. It remains unclear how hospitals and clinics in northern Gaza, treating the wounded and stream of victims from near-constant bombings, could be evacuated. Hospitals are already at full capacity across Gaza. A simultaneous crisis unfolding is the dwindling food and water supplies that will run out in the next few days in U. N. -run shelters, Lynn Hastings, United Nations Resident Coordinator for the Palestinian territories, told NPR. She said the majority of Palestinians in Gaza do not have access to safe drinking water now, not even bottled water. The evacuation order comes as Israel presses its military campaign against Hamas militants based in the Gaza Strip and anticipation grows of a coming Israeli ground assault in Gaza. Israel has been bombarding Gaza all week in retaliation to last weekend's deadly incursion into Israel by Hamas militants. Israel's military has not yet announced a decision on a ground assault. The order also comes on the heels of the U. S. ramping up its diplomatic and military support for Israel in the wake of the unprecedented attacks by Hamas that killed at least 1,300 people over the weekend. U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv, to be followed by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday, as Israel's retaliatory bombardment of the Gaza Strip continued, exacerbating the rapidly growing humanitarian crisis there. Palestinian officials say more than 1,500 people have died in the strikes, and the United Nations reports that 340,000 Palestinians have been displaced. An Israeli siege continued to block the transport of food, water and humanitarian supplies into the territory. UNRWA, the U. N. agency for Palestinian refugees, said early Friday on the social media site X that it had moved its operations center and international staff to the southern part of Gaza. Israel said Thursday it would not lift its siege of Gaza — even for the transport of humanitarian aid — until Hamas releases all remaining hostages. Between 100 and 150 people, including some number of Americans, are believed to be held by the Islamist militant group that rules the Palestinian territory. The U. S. diplomatic efforts come as concerns are growing the chaos — the worst outbreak of violence in Israel and Gaza in recent memory — could spread to the occupied West Bank and different countries across the Middle East. The U. S. has already sent munitions to Israel, including small-diameter bombs designed to be used by Israeli aircraft, and interceptor missiles for Israel's missile defense system known as the Iron Dome. U. S. military and civilian personnel are also on the ground in Israel to assist with the hostage situation. ""You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself, but as long as America exists, you will never, ever have to. We will always be there by your side,"" Blinken said, speaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a military headquarters in Tel Aviv. The U. S. top diplomat also urged Israel to take every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians in Gaza as it retaliates. ""We democracies distinguish ourselves from terrorists by striving for a different standard, even when it's difficult,"" Blinken said. Israeli officials say the bombardment campaign is necessary to stamp out Hamas and defend Israel. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Thursday his country has the right to defend itself after the deadly attacks. ""I agree there are many, many Palestinians who don't agree to this. But unfortunately, in their homes there are missiles shooting at us, [at] my children, on the entire nation of Israel. We have to defend ourselves,"" he said while speaking to reporters. In addition to the growing number of Palestinians killed, more than 6,200 people have been wounded by Israeli bombs since Saturday, officials in Gaza said. Israel has dropped 6,000 munitions in six days of retaliation, the Israel Defense Forces reported Thursday. The bombardment has flattened buildings and demolished ""entire sections of neighborhoods,"" according to the United Nations. The Israeli blockade of Gaza has strained humanitarian capabilities. Potable water in Gaza was already hard to come by, and the territory's main power plant shut down Wednesday after fuel ran out, Palestinian officials reported. Every bed is filled at all of the territory's functioning hospitals, officials say, and facilities are running low on fuel for portable generators that are providing power. ""We fear that hospitals may turn into graveyards if they are not fed with electricity,"" said Hisham Mhanna, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza, speaking to NPR Wednesday. At Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest, hallways and waiting rooms overflowed Thursday with women and children awaiting updates on family members being treated inside. For the doctors and nurses working there, the grim day had one bright spot: A baby boy rescued alive from the rubble of a destroyed home in Jabalia, a city on the north side of Gaza. ""We still don't know his identity, but he's in good health. We're trying to use social media to help identify him,"" said Dr. Muneer al-Bursh, a Palestinian health official who spoke to reporters at the hospital. The Gaza Strip's border crossings are closed in both Israel and Egypt, leaving Palestinian civilians with nowhere to escape or seek safety. More than one-tenth of Gaza's population of about 2. 3 million people is internally displaced. Many have sought shelter in U. N. -run schools. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees said 11 of its employees were killed in the Gaza Strip, a toll that included five teachers, a gynecologist, an engineer and other support staff. Israeli military officials say airstrikes are aimed at Hamas targets. ""We are not just doing carpet-bombing,"" Israeli military Lt. Col. Richard Hecht said at a Thursday press briefing. ""There is no target that we're going for that is not based on intelligence. ""As the bombardment continued on the war's sixth day, residents of Gaza grappled with the possibility of an Israeli ground invasion. ""I cannot imagine what would happen in the following few hours. Am I going to be dead or alive? I really don't know,"" Ghada Alhaddad, an Oxfam communications officer in Gaza, told NPR. Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza after the Hamas militant group took control of the territory in 2007. Egypt was sending in some aid through its border with Gaza but has stopped these deliveries since Tuesday due to Israel's airstrikes of the Gaza side of the Rafah border crossing. Some law enforcement agencies in major cities in the U. S. are increasing their security presence due to a reported call by a former leader of Hamas for a global ""day of anger"" on Friday. ""There are no specific, credible threats to New York City,"" the NYPD said in a statement. But the department said it's increasing the presence of uniformed deployments at large gatherings and cultural sites ""out of an abundance of caution. ""Mayor Eric Adams said increased security will be deployed to both Jewish and Muslim religious sites as well as schools on Friday. In Washington, D. C. , the U. S. Capitol Police similarly said its received no specific threats, but that it will increase security throughout the Capitol complex on Friday. The current war began last weekend when Hamas fighters launched a surprise attack from Gaza into Israel during the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah. Militants infiltrated Israel's border Saturday using paragliders, motorbikes and boats and fired thousands of rockets toward the country from Gaza. They overran a police station and military positions, and a group gunned down revelers at a dance music festival near Israel's border with Gaza, killing more than 200 people. Others raided gated communities and shot families dead, and Israeli officials estimate they took at least 100 hostages to the Gaza Strip. Israel is mobilizing troops along the country's border with the Gaza Strip and has continued its bombardments. Israeli forces ""are preparing for a ground maneuver if decided,"" the IDF's Hecht said Thursday, but the country's political leadership has not yet ordered one. At least 27 U. S. citizens were killed in the Hamas attacks and 15 Americans are currently unaccounted for, a White House spokesperson said Thursday. Charter flights to evacuate U. S. citizens who remain in Israel will begin Friday. Other countries, such as China, France and the United Kingdom, have also reported citizens killed or missing in the conflict. Questions have mounted over how Hamas — whose communications and operations are heavily surveilled by Israeli intelligence services — caught Israel by surprise. Three days before the Hamas attacks, Egypt had warned Israel of a possible threat, said House Foreign Affairs Chair Michael McCaul, R-Texas, after a classified briefing Wednesday.    ""We know that this had been planned for perhaps as long as a year ago,"" McCaul said. ""We're not quite sure how we missed it. We're not quite sure how Israel missed it.

Jewish groups at the White House on Wednesday to express solidarity and support after the Hamas attack on Israel, and pledge that his administration is doing what it can to ensure the safe release of hostages. Biden said the United States is sending experts to advise and assist with hostage recovery efforts. He also said he directed Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Attorney General Merrick Garland to work to boost security and address threats to the Jewish community in America. ""You worry about kids being targeted at school, going about their daily lives, hurt by the downplaying of Hamas' atrocities, and blaming Israel. This is unconscionable,"" Biden said. John Kirby, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said Wednesday that the White House is not tracking any specific targeted violence toward Jews in the United States since the attack in Israel by Hamas, a Palestinian military group, this past weekend. The meeting included officials from more than 20 Jewish organizations ranging from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) to J Street and included top Biden aides such as national security adviser Jake Sullivan. It was led by Douglas Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Harris. Emhoff is the first Jewish spouse of any U. S. president or vice president. In his remarks, Biden spoke about the need to speak out against the horrific violence of the attack. ""I would argue it's the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust,"" Biden said. ""I never really thought that I would see, have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children,"" he said. It was unclear whether Biden had seen pictures. A National Security Council official said Biden was referring to media reports from Israel. NPR has not independently verified the reports. Biden also said he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have a ""frank"" relationship and he told Netanyahu that it was critical for Israel to ""operate by the rules of war,"" despite all the anger and frustration over the attack. Emhoff, who introduced Biden, has been leading the administration's efforts on combating antisemitism. ""We witnessed a mass murder of innocent civilians,"" Emhoff told the group of Jewish leaders, pounding his fist on the lectern. ""It was a terrorist assault. There is never any justification for terrorism. There are no two sides to this issue. The images that we saw will be seared in our brains forever,"" Emhoff said.

371,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/11/1205017249/how-to-talk-to-children-violence-israeli-palestinian-gaza-hamas,"The scale of last weekend's surprise attacks by Hamas militants on Israel has staggered Israel and the world. Hundreds of Israelis have been killed, thousands injured and dozens still held hostage by Hamas, young children included. Israel's ongoing retaliation has left hundreds of Palestinians dead, at least 90 children among them, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. And humanitarian groups are warning of a coming crisis if Israel follows through on its vow to cut off food, water and electricity to Gaza, where nearly half of residents are under 18 years of age. The news is alarming for anyone — and especially for children, who may be left grappling with questions about why other children are among those affected, and whether they are safe. Here's some advice on how to get started with talking to kids about the conflict. Children of all ages deserve a conversation, said experts interviewed by NPR — even those without loved ones who live in Israel or Gaza. Many children are likely to have heard something already, experts agreed, whether from peers at school, by picking up on news broadcasts or by overhearing adults' conversations. Often parents choose to sit back, believing that their kids will start a conversation when they feel ready. That can be a mistake, said Waheeda Saif, a program coordinator at Riverside Trauma Center in Massachusetts. ""We don't want to wait for our kids to come to us,"" she said.  Instead, Saif suggests using open-ended questions to start a conversation: ""'Have you heard what's been going on in the world?' 'Have you heard anything about what's going on in Israel and Palestine?' And just see what they say, and take it from there,"" she said. Older children with access to the internet should be encouraged to be skeptical of videos shared on social media and offered help with evaluating news sources, experts said. And for younger children, it can be important to assure them of their safety, several said. ""They may actually think it's happening much closer to them than it is. They may not realize quite how far away in the world these events are happening,"" said Saif. Parents can use a map to show the distance between their home and where the conflict is occurring. The best conversations with children about difficult subjects often means talking less and allowing kids to ask questions, said Dimitry Anselme, executive program director at the education group Facing History & Ourselves. ""They need context more than our opinions or political positions. That's not very helpful to them,"" Anselme said. For parents to provide that context most effectively, Anselme advised parents to do an internal check-in before opening a conversation with their children. ""Start with yourself. Do some personal reflection,"" he said. ""Brush up and make sure you have an understanding of the basic elements of what's happening in the conflict. "" (Here are some stories to get you started: What is Hamas? What is the Gaza Strip? And here's the latest update on events. )Children, even those who are quite young, can handle complex topics. Parents need not shy away from explaining historical context to their children, said Maha Bali, a professor of practice at the Center for Learning and Teaching at the American University in Cairo. During a previous outbreak of violence between Hamas and Israel in 2021, Bali realized that her 9-year-old daughter had already read about Anne Frank and the Holocaust — but she hadn't yet learned about the history of Palestine. ""It was important to know about the Holocaust. It was important to know about Hitler. Therefore, she was also probably ready to learn about Palestine,"" Bali said. Together, she and her daughter discussed the region's history, from the formation of Israel out of British-held Palestine in the wake of World War II all the way through the still-running blockade of Gaza, in which Israel controls the flow of people and goods into and out of the territory. There's no need to oversimplify the conflict. Experts cautioned against equating the actions of individuals or organizations with entire populations. ""We're talking specifically about this individual, this group of individuals. We're not making a general statement about all Jews, all Palestinians,"" said Anselme of Facing History & Ourselves. It's important for parents and guardians to know that it's OK if they don't have all the answers, said Sivan Zakai, a professor of Jewish education at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. ""When children are asking parents profound questions about the world — especially about violence in the world — it might initially sound like they're asking their parents to be historians and political scientists all rolled into one,"" Zakai said. ""But . . . often their questions are actually asking, 'How can I live in this world even when there are all sorts of terrible things that happen?'"" As pessimistic as you may feel about the state of the world, she added, be sure to allow your child the freedom to imagine (and work toward) a better future. ""Children have a beautiful ability — one that adults sometimes lack — to look head on in the face of violence and still believe in the bottom of their hearts in the future possibility of peace and of coexistence and of resolution to this conflict,"" she said.

Please, just let them go. """"I don't think I ever saw anything like that,"" Dan added. ""Even with the worst terror attacks in Israel against Israel, never, ever. ""Families across Israel are frantically trying to look for any clues about their loved ones who are believed to be held in the Gaza Strip. Images and videos are starting to emerge and circulate on social media showing civilians — some of them children — being forcefully led away from their homes by armed Hamas militants. One of those videos that's been circulating shows Dan's 12-year-old relative, Erez. Don believes he's being held in the Gaza Strip. And inside Gaza, residents are already deep in a humanitarian crisis just five days into this war between Israel and Hamas. There are no humanitarian corridors to bring in medical supplies and aid in the midst of a siege by Israeli forces and retaliatory air strikes. The strikes have killed more than 1,055 people, among them some 500 women and children. Entire families have been killed and there's no way for people to leave.  Israel has cut off food, fuel, water and electricity. And by Wednesday afternoon the International Committee of the Red Cross said the main power plant shut off because it had no fuel. Gaza is in the dark. For all the latest developments on this story, listen live to Morning Edition now. The fate of the hostages in the midst of all this is also unclear. The military wing of Hamas has threatened to execute a hostage for every bomb that's dropped on a home without warning. So far Hamas has not publicly acted on its threat to kill any of them. Dan remains hopeful that those are empty threats. He replays the video of his nephew and seizes on something he hears one of the militants say. ""What it says in Arabic is don't hurt him, don't hurt him"" said Dan, adding that the hostages are more likely being held as ""a precious bargaining chip. ""But Dan is still alarmed not only by the way Hamas carried out such a highly choreographed invasion that involved more than 1000 militant fighters and the ""killings and murders and ruthless humiliation of bodies we saw only with ISIS. "" He is also concerned how Israel's intelligence services were blindsided by an attack that many in Israel say is the country's 9/11 . ""I think that if the government — from the soldiers at the border, through the commanders, through the minister of defense, through the prime minister — all should at least be kicked out, go home or maybe even be in jail. I don't understand what happened here. Nobody can,"" Dan said. For all the latest developments on this story, listen live to Morning Edition now.

373,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/11/1204923717/israel-gaza-hamas-palestinian-war,"It's not uncommon for violence to break out between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza. It typically goes like this: Hamas throws rockets over the Gaza border into Israel, most of which are intercepted by the Iron Dome — Israel's very sophisticated missile defense system. The impact in Israel is usually minimized. Israel then responds with airstrikes on the densely populated Gaza Strip. But what happened last weekend was unprecedented in its scale and coordination. Militants attacked Israeli communication towers with improvised explosives, they breached the Gaza-Israel border fence within minutes and assumed control of several Israeli communities. They paraglided over the border and gunned down civilians at a music festival. Hamas killed at least 1,200 people in the attack and took dozens hostage, including women, children and the elderly — all while Israel's military was late to respond. It was the deadliest attack Israel has seen in decades. In retaliation, Israel has laid siege to Gaza with hundreds of airstrikes that have killed at least 1,000 Palestinians and displaced more than 200,000 people. It has cut off electricity, food and fuel supplies. Speaking to mayors of the southern border towns that were hit by the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's response ""will change the Middle East. ""Troops have now amassed for a possible ground invasion of Gaza, which last happened in 2014 and resulted in at least 2,000 Palestinians killed, and more than 70 on the Israeli side. It's the biggest escalation in the decades-long conflict between Israelis and Palestinians in recent years. But experts who follow the region closely point to key developments over the past year in Israel and the Palestinian territories that set the stage for this explosion of violence. Netanyahu was reelected less than a year ago and formed a government by aligning with ultranationalists and religious conservatives. Tal Schneider, the political and diplomatic correspondent for The Times of Israel, told NPR that Netanyahu's appointment of two controversial figures into his Cabinet intensified tensions within Israeli politics. ""He nominated someone who was convicted for eight times in inciting violence against Arabs,"" Schneider said, referring to Itamar Ben-Gvir, the minister of national security. ""This is someone who was outlawed, who was for us Israelis, someone who was not supposed to sit in government. Netanyahu made him a strong leader and someone who is fully engaged in politics. ""Ben-Gvir, along with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, pushed for more settlements in the occupied West Bank, escalating tensions with Palestinians. ""The war Cabinet of Netanyahu was completely dysfunctional with them,"" Schneider said. Then there is Netanyahu's plan to overhaul Israel's judiciary, which has been delayed, but not abandoned, due to support from the far-right politicians, after mass protests broke out for months as Israelis rejected the proposal to weaken the country's supreme court. ""They want to change Israel's balance of power, the way Israel functions as a democracy. People here erupted, especially those who are doing reserve duty in the army. They went out to demonstrate and some of them announced that they will not serve anymore under a dictatorship. So, obviously, the military was very weakened,"" Schneider said, adding that all of this contributed to Hamas perceiving a weaker Israel. With the most far-right, ultranationalist and religiously conservative government Israel had seen in power, Hamas saw an opportunity as conditions worsened for Palestinians — not only those in Gaza, who have been living under a blockade for 16 years, but the West Bank as well, according to Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat professor for peace and development at the University of Maryland. There has been an increase in violence between Israeli settlers and Palestinian villagers this past year, which has displaced hundreds of Palestinians, according to the United Nations. Israeli police also increasingly conducted raids in cities like Jenin and Nablus and at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem — a flashpoint in the conflict. ""You have an increase in settler violence, an encroachment in East Jerusalem, which is really critical,"" Telhami said. ""People don't understand how important Jerusalem is to the Palestinians, to many people in the Arab and Muslim world. That's why, in fact, Hamas named this operation Al Aqsa Flood, referring to the holy mosque in Jerusalem. So, they're trying to capture that mood. ""Telhami, who was in the West Bank last week, said he observed total despair and desperation after 56 years of occupation by Israel. ""At first [the Palestinians] were counting on Biden to do something after Trump. That didn't happen. Then they were counting on Arab states to do something. Instead, the Saudis and Israelis are trying to make peace without them, in a way,"" he said. Telhami said Hamas, which is designated as a terrorist group by Israel, the U. S. and European countries, saw the ""perfect political opportunity for them, in a horrific way, to reshuffle the deck"" and to also neutralize the influence of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, led by Mahmoud Abbas. Another thread that contributed to this moment is the way in which Netanyahu has dealt with Hamas over his years in power. ""He didn't have a straight-out policy and the prime minister obviously now denies it in hindsight,"" Schneider said. ""But we know as reporters who have been following this for many years. They wanted to weaken the Palestinian Authority. ""The goal for Netanyahu, according to Schneider, was to avoid the building of a future Palestinian state at any cost. And he did that in the way he approached Hamas, by allowing cash to flow into Gaza, which is ruled by Hamas, and making deals with the militants via Egypt.  ""Netanyahu, in order to get Mahmoud Abbas to be smaller and to humiliate him politically, they managed to give Hamas some sort of leverage,"" Schneider said. As the conflict is expected to escalate even further in the coming days, the long-term strategies for both Hamas and Israel remain to be seen.   For now, Hamas sees itself with the upper hand. ""They think they've undermined Israeli deterrence. They've shown Israel to be weaker than it claims to be,"" Telhami said. ""They're becoming more popular in the Arab and Muslim countries, you can see people rallying behind them in places like Morocco that have already made peace with Israel and Egypt too. ""But, in the short term, Hamas' ability to survive and withstand an Israeli response is in question. And even with its military superiority, Telhami and Schneider see no winning military strategy for Israel. ""I mean, the Israelis could prevail and destroy Hamas and destroy Gaza. And then what? Then what?"" Telhami said, adding that the Biden administration, which has been focused on brokering a deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, needed to rethink its approach as well. ""If I were in the Biden administration's position, I would already start laying out knowing that there's going to be a deadlock,"" he said. ""Even if there's a military outcome that ends the military part of the conflict, there's going to be a need for some political shift that's dramatic, far more than they were anticipating, and they need to plan it now. """"The war is not outside of Israel. It's inside Israel,"" Schneider said. ""I don't ever recall that in recent history. And I have to tell you, we are losing big time. They're losing big time. It's a vicious circle of blood with no end in sight. A completely lose-lose situation. And it's just horrific. """,npr_articles/article_373.txt,npr_results/article_373.txt.json
374,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/11/1205036361/israel-strikes-neighborhoods-across-gaza-as-the-war-with-hamas-intensifies,"TEL AVIV and SDEROT, Israel — Israel carried out heavy bombardments across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday for the fifth day as more than 2 million Palestinians lost electricity after Israel put the territory under full siege, following an infiltration by Hamas militants into Israel in one of the deadliest attacks ever on the country. Witnesses have described widespread destruction of entire neighborhoods in Gaza City from Israeli strikes overnight, as residents shared videos online showing children pulled wounded or dead from under the rubble. It all comes as Israel and Gaza experience one of the most dramatic escalations in violence in recent memory, with concerns the chaos could spread to the occupied West Bank and different countries in the Middle East. This round of bloodshed began with a surprise attack by Palestinian fighters from Gaza into Israel during the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah. On Saturday, militants infiltrated Israel's border using paragliders, motorbikes and boats and fired thousands of rockets toward the country from Gaza. Israeli officials say more than 1,200 people in Israel were killed in the assault and that the militants returned to Gaza with hostages. The number of Palestinians in Gaza killed by Israeli forces since the weekend has now surpassed 1,000, according to officials in Gaza, with more than half those killed women and children. At least 22 U. S. citizens died in the fighting in Israel, the U. S. State Department said. President Biden confirmed Tuesday that Americans are among the hostages held by Hamas, but did not say how many. House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who moderated a classified briefing for lawmakers Wednesday, said ""dozens"" of Americans were taken captive. He said the U. S. is working with Israeli officials to rescue them, suggesting that U. S. special forces and hostage rescue teams may be involved. Other countries, such as France and the United Kingdom, have also reported citizens killed or missing in the conflict. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees said 11 of its employees were killed in the Gaza Strip. Even as Israelis and Palestinians in Gaza mourned their dead in funerals, Hamas militants in Gaza continued to fire rockets toward Israel, as Israeli forces continued to bomb the Gaza Strip. Israel's Iron Dome defense system blocks most rocket attacks, but air raid sirens have been heard as far north as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, as some rockets have broken through. Hamas, which governs Gaza, said earlier Wednesday that the territory would be plunged into ""complete darkness"" within the day. Hours later, Gaza's main power plant shut down. Israel has put Gaza under complete siege, barring the entry of fuel, food, water, medicine and more into the territory. Tasneem Ahel, a dental student sheltering in her uncle's home after her house was destroyed in Gaza, said she had been wounded in a previous war with Israel. She said adults are rationing food so that the children sheltering in the home are not hungry. ""We don't have water. We don't have food. We don't have anything to live,"" Ahel said. She said feels like she's facing death at any moment from Israeli warplanes. ""They steal my dreams and our dreams again,"" Ahel said. The Biden administration said there are talks to create a safe corridor for civilians, echoing a call from the U. N. World Food Programme to create emergency humanitarian corridors. The Palestinian Health Ministry is also calling for the same to allow medication and medical teams in, as well as to allow those with complex wounds out of Gaza to seek emergency treatment elsewhere. All of the Gaza Strip's borders are closed, leaving Palestinian civilians with nowhere to escape or seek safety. Around one-tenth of Gaza's population of about 2. 3 million people is internally displaced. Many have sought shelter in U. N. -run schools. Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza after the Hamas militant group took control of the territory in 2007. Egypt was sending in some aid through its border with Gaza but has stopped these deliveries since Tuesday due to Israel's airstrikes of the Gaza side of the border crossing. Israelis held funerals for those killed in Saturday's attack, when militants from the Gaza Strip infiltrated Israel, attacking communities along the country's southern border. Militants overran a police station and military positions. They gunned down revelers at a dance music festival near Israel's border with Gaza, killing more than 200 people. They raided gated communities and shot families dead, and Israeli officials estimate they took at least 100 hostages to the Gaza Strip. Hamas is expected to try to use the hostages in bargaining to free some of the thousands of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, but the group insists it will not negotiate while Gaza is under attack. Hamas' military wing, Ezzedin al-Qassam Brigades, threatened to execute a civilian hostage every time civilians in Gaza die in their homes from Israeli airstrikes that come without warning. No such publicly known execution has yet been carried out. Israel has called up more than 300,000 reservists to its border with Gaza in preparation for what appears to be planning for a ground invasion. Volunteers are rallying to support the troops, offering prayers, food and any other basics to the reservists. The streets of Tel Aviv, usually bustling with stores, bars and tourists, are largely empty of traffic and pedestrians. Schools are closed across the country as the nation prepares for what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said will be ""difficult days ahead. "" He said Israel is fighting to ensure its existence. In southern Israeli towns and cities near the border with Gaza, many residents have been evacuated, but some have chosen to stay behind. In addition to the more than 1,000 Palestinians killed, over 5,000 people have been wounded by Israeli bombs since Saturday, officials in Gaza said. The Palestinian Health Ministry said Wednesday that it is rationing services due to the electricity crisis. Doctors Without Borders' head of mission in the Palestinian territories, Léo Cans, said in a statement that hospitals are overwhelmed in Gaza. He said that among the complex cases that doctors are trying to treat was that of a 13-year-old boy whose body was almost completely burned after a fire broke out from a bomb that fell next his house. ""The declaration of war must not, under any circumstances, lead to collective punishment of the population of Gaza,"" Cans said, adding that not even ambulances and hospitals have been spared damage from the airstrikes. The International Committee of the Red Cross' spokesperson in Gaza, Hisham Mhanna, explained that water and sewage treatment plants also need electricity to function. ""And we fear that hospitals may turn into graveyards if they are not fed with electricity,"" he told NPR, adding that there are also patients struggling to receive treatment for other ailments and needs. ""We're talking about sick children, chronic diseases patients, elderly people, pregnant women who may have no access to any medical supply or aid or service in the next few hours or days,"" Mhanna said. The first shipment of U. S. weapons since the weekend's attack recently arrived in Israel, as U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is traveling to Israel to deliver a message of solidarity and support. Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of U. S. international aid since World War II, receiving a total of $158 billion to date, according to the Congressional Research Service. The U. S. has also sent a naval vessel to the eastern Mediterranean Sea, saying its purpose is to deter any armed groups or countries seeking to escalate the situation or widen this war. Aboard are eight squadrons of attack and support aircraft, a guided missile cruiser and guided missile destroyers. In an address from Washington, President Biden called Hamas' attack on Israel ""pure unadulterated evil"" and promised to ""make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of itself. ""In an interview on NPR's All Things Considered, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said some Americans are among those held hostage by Hamas but called it ""a very small number of Americans that we know of. ""The relatives of U. S. -Israeli citizens who've gone missing and may be held hostage told reporters in Tel Aviv on Tuesday that so far no one from the U. S. or Israeli governments had yet reached out to them with any information about their relatives. The father of a missing Israeli soldier, who also holds U. S. citizenship, asked in the news conference if any U. S. Embassy officials were in the room. No one responded. Aya Batrawy reported from Tel Aviv and Daniel Estrin from Sderot.

375,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/10/1204873146/what-is-gaza-strip,"LONDON — Human rights groups call it ""the world's largest open-air prison. "" The Gaza Strip, home to 2. 3 million people, has come under heavy bombardment from Israel in recent days, after Hamas militants launched an unprecedented ground invasion and thousands of rockets into Israel from Gaza. Israel has ordered a ""complete"" blockade of the already besieged area, saying that ""no electricity, food or fuel"" would be allowed into the enclave and raising alarm among some in the international community over what this might mean for the people of Gaza, who, with borders mostly closed, cannot leave. The Gaza Strip is a 25-mile-long by 6-mile-wide enclave, bounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Israel to the north and east and Egypt to the south. Gaza is one of two Palestinian territories. The other is the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Bordered by walls and fences erected by Israel, the Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated territories in the world. The strip has been under a blockade by Israel and Egypt, restricting the movement of people and goods since Hamas seized control of the territory in 2007. Israel controls its airspace and shoreline, as well as what goods can cross Gaza's borders. Gaza is home to more than 2 million Palestinians — 1. 7 million of whom are Palestinian refugees, according to UNRWA, the U. N. Palestinian relief agency. The charity Save the Children says children make up almost half of Gaza's population. Conditions in Gaza have badly deteriorated in the 16 years since the blockade was imposed. The United Nations says more than 80% of Gazans live in poverty, with access to clean water and electricity at crisis levels even before the latest violence. UNRWA says clean water is unavailable for 95% of Gaza's population. The territory's unemployment rate stood at 46% in the second quarter of this year, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. Over 80% of those living in Gaza depend on aid because of restrictions on movement in and out of the enclave and ongoing hostilities with Israel. Israel and Egypt maintain that the blockade is necessary to protect against militants, but Palestinians and humanitarian groups say it amounts to collective punishment. During an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in 2021, U. N. Secretary-General António Guterres described conditions for children in the Gaza Strip as ""hell on Earth. ""Gaza's hospitals are regularly beset with shortages of equipment and medicine because of the blockade. Gaza's Health Ministry director general, Dr. Medhat Abbas, told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly that the area's hospitals, already struggling, now face being overwhelmed following Israel's latest offensive. ""This is applying too much pressure on our health professionals in the hospitals,"" Abbas said. ""Unless these borders are opened at once — for the fuel to run the generators and for medications, medical supplies to come at once to Gaza — there will be a collapse of the health system. ""Gaza was part of what was known as Palestine, prior to the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. As part of historical Palestine, it became part of the Ottoman Empire in the 1500s and, after World War I, it came under Great Britain until 1948. More than 750,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes around Israel's creation in 1948 and fighting with Arab forces, in what Palestinians call al-Nakba, or ""Catastrophe. "" Egypt captured Gaza during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. It remained under Egyptian control until the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, when Israel seized the territory and occupied it, along with the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Palestinians claim these territories and see them as part of a future state. In 2005, Israel withdrew its troops from Gaza and withdrew around 7,000 settlers. The following year, the Hamas movement came out ahead in Gaza elections. But after wrangling with the rival Fatah party, Hamas seized power by force in 2007. Gaza has not had elections since. Israel responded by imposing an air, land and sea blockade of the Gaza Strip. Egypt closed its border crossing with Gaza when Hamas took power in 2007. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel in the last decade and a half. One of the last major wars, in May 2021, left hundreds of people dead in Gaza and 13 dead in Israel — and devastated the Gaza Strip.",npr_articles/article_375.txt,npr_results/article_375.txt.json

377,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/10/1204789074/israel-hamas-hezbollah-iran,"AMMAN, Jordan — Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has denied Iran was involved in Hamas' attack against Israel over the weekend. But in televised comments Tuesday, he said: ""We kiss the hands of those who planned the attack on the Zionist regime. ""Western and Middle Eastern intelligence officials have accused Iran of providing training, money and other assistance to Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, who carried out an unprecedented, multifront assault on Israel on Saturday. The leaders of France and Germany on Tuesday signaled that officials are still looking for evidence of Tehran's direct involvement in the Hamas attacks. But analysts interviewed by NPR say the link is undeniable. Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in 2007 and has since had a series of wars with Israel, which has imposed a blockade on the territory in coordination with Egypt. But Hamas is not the only militant group fighting against Israel. This week, militant groups in southern Lebanon escalated their attacks on neighboring northern Israel, prompting Israel to launch artillery and cross-border airstrikes. The Israeli military said Monday it killed several fighters crossing the border from Lebanon. The Lebanese militant and political organization Hezbollah said one of its fighters was killed in Israel's retaliation. The armed group Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed it had injured seven Israeli soldiers. Monday's fighting follows rocket and drone attacks in the region on Sunday. Both Hezbollah and Israel fired across the border, leading the United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon to urge ""everyone to exercise restraint . . . to de-escalate to prevent a fast deterioration of the security situation. ""The fighting around the northern Israeli border is at a much smaller scale than in southern Israel near Gaza, the Palestinian coastal enclave to Israel's southwest. But the double-pronged attacks at both poles of Israel left many fearing a more widespread, regional escalation of violence. ""Hezbollah's response from southern Lebanon is not opportunistic,"" said Lina Khatib, director of the SOAS Middle East Institute at the University of London. She said Hezbollah, which is a Shia Muslim organization, and Hamas, a Sunni group, have coordinated for years. Several analysts said both groups receive financial, military and rhetorical support from Iran. On Sunday, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, said that Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has met with Hamas leaders. ""We know that there were meetings in Syria and in Lebanon, if I remember correctly, with the other leaders of the terror armies that surround Israel,"" he said. Spokespeople for Hamas did not return requests for comment. Raisi also held phone calls with leaders from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad after the attacks against Israel began, Iran's state-run news agency, IRNA, said Sunday. Iran has been ruled by Shia fundamentalists since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Hezbollah was created shortly after, said Northeastern University associate professor Max Abrahms, to help export the Iranian revolution and project Iranian power in the region. Abrahms, an expert on terrorism in the region, said that Iran's influence over both Hamas and Hezbollah varies and that the Sunni organization operates with more autonomy than Hezbollah does. ""I don't think [Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan] Nasrallah would authorize a major attack against Israel without approval of Iranian leaders,"" he said Monday. ""Whereas I don't know that Hamas waits for Iranian authorization . . . although this one might have been different,"" he said, referencing the surprise attack from Gaza on Saturday morning. Abrahms called state sponsorship of terrorism a ""risky game,"" and he said Iran's link to Hamas and Hezbollah ""substantially increases the likelihood that Iran will be directly attacked by Israel. ""Israeli intelligence analysts call the relationship among Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran ""the resistance camp. "" They share the goal of weakening Israel and creating a Muslim-run land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, said Neomi Neumann, former head of research for the Israeli Security Agency. Neumann, now a visiting fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said despite sharing the same goal, the groups operate on different levels. Hezbollah has a far larger fighting force and is more well equipped than Hamas. ""There's no comparison between Hezbollah and Hamas,"" she said, ""not by the amount and not by the quality. ""But Hamas has managed to impress its Iranian backers — and Hezbollah. ""Since 2021, Iran and [Hezbollah leader] Nasrallah have understood that Hamas is a better player than they thought. Hamas is necessary in order to weaken Israel. ""They realized this, Neumann said Monday, after Hamas sought to unify disparate groups of Palestinians amid clashes with Israel in 2021, among them Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, as well as Arab Israelis, who constitute about 20% of Israel's population. The first day of the current war showed that Hamas is now a capable fighting force, breaching the Israeli fortifications around Gaza and firing thousands of rockets toward Israel from Gaza. The Israeli military says more than 900 Israelis were killed by Hamas attackers and rocket fire in what it has called ""the worst day in Israeli history. """"I want to be precise,"" Neumann said, adding that without Iran, ""none of this would be doable. """,npr_articles/article_377.txt,npr_results/article_377.txt.json

379,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/10/1204826544/hamas-israel-war-gaza-palestinian,"BEIRUT — Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007, launched an attack inside Israel over the weekend, killing hundreds and taking others hostage. Its unprecedented breach of the border sent fighters inside border communities and military installations, shocked Israel and its allies, and raised questions about the group's capabilities and strategy. The group was founded in 1987 by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a Palestinian refugee living in Gaza, during the first intifada, or uprising, which was marked by widespread protests against Israel's occupation. Hamas is the Arabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement, and a recognition of the group's roots and early ties to one of the Sunni world's most prominent groups, the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in the 1920s. The group has vowed to annihilate Israel and has been responsible for many suicide bombings and other deadly attacks on civilians and Israeli soldiers. The U. S. State Department has designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. The European Union and other Western countries also consider it a terrorist organization. Hamas won 2006 parliamentary elections elections and in 2007 violently seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, dominated by rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel responded to the Hamas takeover with a blockade on Gaza, restricting movement of people and goods in and out of the territory in a step it says is needed to keep the group from developing weapons. The blockade has ravaged Gaza's economy, and Palestinians accuse Israel of collective punishment. Over the years, Hamas received backing from Arab countries, such as Qatar and Turkey. Recently, it's moved closer to Iran and its allies. Hamas founder and spiritual leader Yassin — a paralyzed man who used a wheelchair — spent years in Israeli prisons and oversaw the establishment of Hamas' military wing, which carried out its first suicide attack in 1993. Israeli forces have targeted Hamas leaders throughout the years, killing Yassin in 2004. Khaled Mashaal, an exiled Hamas member who survived an earlier Israeli assassination attempt, became the group's leader soon after. Yehia Sinwar, in Gaza, and Ismail Haniyeh, who lives in exile, are Hamas' current leaders. They realigned the group's leadership with Iran and its allies, including Lebanon's Hezbollah. Since then, many of the group's leaders relocated to Beirut. Hamas has always espoused violence as a means to liberate occupied Palestinian territories and has called for the annihilation of Israel. Hamas has carried out suicide bombings and over the years fired tens of thousands of increasingly powerful rockets from Gaza into Israel. It also established a network of tunnels running from Gaza to Egypt to smuggle in weapons, as well as attack tunnels burrowing into Israel. In recent years, Hamas had appeared to be more focused on running Gaza than attacking Israel. In recent years, Israel has made peace deals with Arab countries without having to make concessions in its conflict with the Palestinians. The U. S. has recently been trying to broker a deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a bitter rival of Hamas' Iranian backers. Meanwhile, Israel's new far-right government was working to cement Israeli settlements in the West Bank despite Palestinian opposition. Hamas leaders say an Israeli crackdown on militants in the West Bank, continued construction of settlements — which the international community considers to be illegal — thousands of prisoners in Israeli jails, and its ongoing blockade of Gaza pushed it to attack. Its leaders say hundreds of its 40,000 fighters took part in the assault. Israel says the group has about 30,000 fighters and an arsenal of rockets, including some with a range of about 250 kilometers (155 miles), and unmanned drones.",npr_articles/article_379.txt,npr_results/article_379.txt.json

The tell-tale sign? The two young red-headed boys she was clutching to her chest, wrapped in a blanket. Shnaider, 45, hasn't heard from Shiri Bibes since the surprise attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7th. That day started unlike any other. Shnaider, who runs a real estate business in Holon, heard so many air raid sirens that he assumed the system had broken. When he heard that Hamas fighters had crossed into Israel from Gaza, he tried to reach Bibes and her husband, Yarden Bibes, who live near the border in Kibbutz Nir Oz. He got no reply. Shnaider also couldn't get in touch with his aunt, Margit Silverman and her husband, Yossi Silverman. Frantically searching social media for any pictures or videos from the village, that's when he found the video of Bibes and her children, 4-year-old Ariel and 9-month-old Kfir. He'd later find a picture of Yarden Bibes, bleeding from the head, sandwiched between two Hamas fighters on a motorcycle. Now, Shnaider believes the family is being held captive in Gaza. He doesn't know if his aunt or uncle are alive. ""It took me almost two days just to wake up. To understand that it's not a dream. It's not a nightmare. It's something that really happened"" Shnaider told NPR's Morning Edition. Now, he wants Israel to end Hamas as a threat to Israel. ""It's time to finish with Hamas once and for all,"" he said. Amidst the raw pain he was feeling, Shnaider didn't have much room to think about similarly innocent people in Gaza being caught up in Israel's bombing campaign in response. ""We are sorry for all the babies and children that are suffering over there,"" he said. ""But there is only one blame on this, it's on Hamas. ""The opposite was true for Yonatan Zeigen, whose mother is missing following the attack. ""It's just a terrible tragedy for everybody,"" Zeigen told NPR. He was on the phone with his mother, Vivian Silver, when Hamas arrived in her village, Kibbutz Beeri. As he heard gunshots outside the 74-year-old's window, he told her to hang up so she could stay quiet. They began to text one other on WhatsApp. ""She told me that they're inside the house, and we expressed our love for each other, and that was it,"" Zeigen said. Zeigen, 35, hasn't heard from her since. But he is optimistic that he'll see her again, if she's now a hostage inside Gaza. ""If she's being held there, I think it's a situation that has to be resolved,"" he said. ""And I trust that the militant organizations in Gaza won't hurt her. Because of her status as an elderly woman and their religious ethics. ""Silver has spent her life pursuing peace in the region, Zeigen said. ""Since she retired, she was very much involved in an organization called Women Wage Peace. Since 2015, she also volunteered with an organization called The Road to Recovery,"" noted Zeigen. ""She would drive sick Palestinians from Gaza to Israeli hospitals. So apart from being a wonderful mother and grandmother, that was her essence,"" he added. Despite their different views on how Israel should approach their campaign against Hamas, Zeigen and Shnaider were both waiting for the same thing - news from Israel's government that they're negotiating for the release of their loved ones.

A video purporting to show an Israeli woman being attacked in Gaza was filmed in 2015 in Guatemala. An unverified voice message circulating on WhatsApp, along with the note ""forwarded many times,"" says a military official has instructed Israelis to stock up on cash, fuel and groceries. Fake accounts posing as a BBC journalist and the Jerusalem Post newspaper spread false information widely before being suspended by X (formerly known as Twitter). In the wake of Hamas' surprise attack on Israel and the escalation into war over the weekend, social media platforms and messaging apps are awash in viral rumors, misleading images and videos, and outright falsehoods, making it hard for people in Israel, Gaza and around the world seeking information and facts about the conflict. Many online videos are being taken out of context or mischaracterized — a frequent occurrence in breaking news situations where interest is high but verified information is hard to come by. ""Once we saw the events happening, the war started, there was a void of information. No one knew nothing. And [into] this vacuum of information entered all kinds of interest groups, fear, confusion and conspiracies,"" said Achiya Schatz, executive director of FakeReporter, an Israeli watchdog group that tracks misinformation. Misleading posts born of fear and confusion are being amplified within a broader online information ecosystem inundated with graphic, violent footage posted by Hamas, Israeli military forces and supporters aligned with both sides. ""The violent content that is being pushed out across a range of different social media platforms as well as as well as encrypted messaging apps is being used to essentially to gloat, celebrate attacks, as well as . . . to insinuate war crimes,"" said Moustafa Ayad, executive director for Africa, the Middle East and Asia at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a nonprofit that studies extremism. ""This is propaganda 101. You flood the gap, especially in those early hours, with content that suggests a certain narrative, whether it's the strength of one faction over another, whether it's the strength of one state over another, and try to get ahead of the curve,"" he said. The fog of war and accompanying surge in unverified information online is fodder for state actors — including those backed by Iran and Russia — and other groups eager to take advantage of the chaos to fuel division, spread propaganda, attack enemies and sow further confusion. ""All of these actors of course will be squarely focused on the war and how they can twist perception of the war to benefit their objectives,"" said Emerson Brooking, resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. False and misleading claims are also being used to advance political agendas here in the U. S. On X, the site formerly known as Twitter, a fake memo purporting to show the White House announcing $8 billion in military aid to Israel spread on Facebook, showed up high in Google search results, and was boosted on X by accounts that paid $8 for ""verified"" checkmarks. In some cases, the fake memo was paired with allegations the Biden administration funneled $6 billion to Hamas via Iran, which the White House says is false. X has emerged as a particular locus for bogus claims and mischaracterized videos and images, as owner Elon Musk has removed many guardrails against the spread of false and misleading narratives. After cutting much of X's trust and safety staff, Musk has said the site will rely more heavily on user-generated fact checks to address falsehoods. But it's unclear how much impact those fact checks have. One video posted on Sunday by the co-chair of a group that calls itself Republicans Overseas Israel shows a man playing with a baby. The caption claims it depicts a ""Hamas terrorist with kidnapped Jewish baby girl in Gaza. ""But many users quickly pointed out the video was originally posted on TikTok  in August and bears no indication that it depicts a kidnapped child and a terrorist. The X post has been labeled with a user-generated fact check pointing this out, but has been viewed a million times and remains on the platform despite replies urging the poster to delete or correct it. Musk has also added to the confusion on his platform, recommending that ""for following the war in real-time,"" users follow two accounts that have posted spurious claims in the past — including promoting a false report of an explosion at the Pentagon in May that sparked a brief dip in the stock market. Both accounts carry ""verified"" checkmarks, meaning they've paid for X's subscription service. That means their posts get boosted on the platform and they are eligible to earn advertising money. As a result, accounts are able to ""buy this veneer of legitimacy and credibility,"" and have a ""direct profit incentive"" to maximize views of their posts, even if they don't have new information to share, Brooking said. ""I've noticed that some of these accounts, then they editorialize more frequently, they interject their own opinions, or they may suggest things that are not necessarily based in even the data that they're sharing"" he said. ""In this sort of fast-moving conflict situation where people are making real and impactful decisions based off what they're seeing on the platform, the consequences are deeply harmful.

382,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/09/1204715814/israels-netanyahu-says-offensive-against-hamas-is-only-just-beginning,"The Israeli military said Tuesday it had largely regained control of areas in the south that had been attacked by militants from Hamas. The announcement came on the fourth day of war with Hamas and amid an Israeli siege and heavy bombing of The Gaza Strip. The military said it had found ""hundreds and hundreds"" of bodies of Hamas militants who died fighting inside Israel – an indication of the size of their attack. It said there were no longer infiltrators coming over the Gaza border – something in question still Monday. There could still be some holdouts on Israeli territory. The death toll on both sides continued to climb. The Israeli military says more than 1,200 Israelis were killed by Hamas attackers and rocket fire. Palestinian health officials say more than 900 people in Gaza have been killed by Israeli strikes. Thousands more on both sides have been wounded. Meanwhile, in his first televised comments since the war started, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei denied that Iran was involved in the attack but said, ""We kiss the hands of those who planned the attack on the Zionist regime. ""In Washington, President Joe Biden called Hamas' attack on Israel ""pure unadulterated evil"" and promised to ""make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of itself. ""Biden said that 14 Americans had been killed in Israel and more than 20 were missing. In an interview on NPR's All Things Considered, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said there are some Americans among dozens held hostage by Hamas but called it ""a very small number of Americans that we know of. """"There's also a larger number of Americans that are just unaccounted for. Now, some of them could turn up to be in the hostage pool. We just don't know. So we're, we're trying to get as much information as we can,"" Kirby said. The U. N. said nearly 190,000 people have been displaced from their homes in the Palestinian Gaza Strip, with most seeking shelter in U. N. -run schools. The U. N. agency for Palestine refugees said on X that 14 distribution centers had to be closed because of the Israeli airstrikes. The closures have cut off food aid to half a million people, the agency said. The U. N. World Food Program called for emergency humanitarian corridors to open into Gaza after Israel shut off food, fuel, water and electricity from entering. The Palestinian Health Ministry says generators used to power hospitals face fuel shortages and also called for for safe corridors to allow medical teams and medical aid to reach Gaza and so that people with extreme injuries can seek treatment outside the besieged territory. Doctors Without Borders says the situation in Gaza is catastrophic with ambulances hit and hospitals damaged. Gaza residents woke up Tuesday to scenes of destruction of multi-story residential buildings. The hospitals have treated thousands of wounded. Meanwhile, several hundred thousand Israeli reservists are at Israel's border with Gaza in what appears to be preparation for a ground invasion. Israel has put Gaza's 2. 3 million residents under complete siege, cutting off water, food, fuel and energy to the territory. Egypt has also closed its borders with Gaza. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country's offensive against the militant group Hamas was only just beginning, as he vowed to lay total siege to the Gaza Strip in the wake of an unprecedented assault on Israel's territory and citizens. The bloodshed began on the Jewish Simchat Torah holiday, and a day after the 50th anniversary of the start of the Yom Kippur War, when Israel came under attack by Arab countries. The Palestinian militant group Hamas, which took control of Gaza in 2007, launched a massive surprise attack along Israel's southern border on Saturday. Militants infiltrated Israel's border using paragliders, motorbikes, and boats. The group also fired an estimated 3,000 rockets throughout the day toward Israel, according to Israel Defense Forces. ""We have only started striking Hamas,"" Netanyahu said in an address late Monday. ""What we will do to our enemies in the coming days will reverberate with them for generations. ""As Netanyahu spoke, Israel continued its retaliatory missile strikes on the Gaza Strip to bombard Hamas targets. Israeli forces were also amassing troops for a possible land invasion after its military called up reservist soldiers. ""The atrocities committed by Hamas have not been seen since ISIS atrocities. Bound children executed along with their families,"" Netanyahu described late Monday. ""Young men and women shot in the back, executed. Other horrors I won't describe here. ""Over the weekend, Netanyahu said anyone in areas where Hamas operates in the Gaza Strip should leave. Gaza has been under a blockade by Israel and Egypt for 16 years. The military wing of Hamas, known as Ezzedin Al-Qassam Brigades, has said that every time an Israeli strike without warning kills civilians, the group would ""execute a civilian hostage"" and said it would release audio and images. Hamas has reportedly taken about 150 people — men, women, children, and soldiers — hostage following Saturday's incursion into Israel.  The weekend's violence came after recent weeks of Israeli military clashes with Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel and militants in Gaza have fought multiple wars in the last decade and a half. Leaders of the U. S. , the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy released a joint statement on Monday condemning Hamas and ""its appalling acts of terrorism. "" ""We make clear that the terrorist actions of Hamas have no justification, no legitimacy, and must be universally condemned. There is never any justification for terrorism,"" the statement read. The leaders went on to add they ""recognize the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, and support equal measures of justice and freedom for Israelis and Palestinians alike. "" ""But make no mistake,"" the group underscored. ""Hamas does not represent those aspirations, and it offers nothing for the Palestinian people other than more terror and bloodshed. "" Citizens from around the globe have been caught up in the ongoing violence. Biden said Monday that commercial flights remain available for those wanting to leave, but urged Americans fleeing the region to take ""sensible precautions in the days ahead and follow the guidance of local authorities. ""A number of Latin American countries have also reported citizens missing in the conflict or have staged efforts to get them to safety. Argentina's Minister of Foreign Affairs said 250 Argentinians had signed up for an evacuation registry that the country's consulate was preparing in Tel Aviv, while Peru reported two of its citizens missing. Officials in Colombia said its consulate in Tel Aviv was assisting 180 Colombian tourists — mostly in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Bethlehem, and Nazareth.  Meanwhile, U. S. officials tell NPR they are offering Israel air defense and munitions and are pressing to get munitions to the country as quickly as possible. Department of Defense officials offered no timetable on the USS Gerald Ford Strike Group — which includes an aircraft carrier, a guided missile cruiser, and guided missile destroyers — making its way to the Mediterranean. Dr. Medhat Abbas, director general of Gaza's Health Ministry, says with resources cut off and borders with Gaza closed, Israel's offensive is putting strains on an already hampered healthcare system. He told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly the situation has become dire. ""This is applying too much pressure on our health professionals in the hospitals,"" Abbas said. ""Unless these borders are opened at once — for the fuel to run the generators and for medications, medical supplies to come at once together — there will be a collapse of the health system. ""Abbas says several ambulances in Gaza have also been struck. He said at least five colleagues have been killed, including one ambulance driver. ""They said, 'We have not started yet. We have not started yet,'"" Abbas said, referring to Netanyahu's comments that the Israeli offensive was just beginning. ""If after all of that they have not started, what will happen when they really — I don't know.

383,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/09/1204662594/europe-condemn-hamas-support-israel-suspend-palestinian-aid,"LONDON — Landmark buildings around Europe, including 10 Downing Street in London and the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, have lit up with the Israeli flag — and some cities have seen pro-Palestinian protests — as governments across the continent convened emergency meetings to respond to the conflict in Israel and Gaza. Concern is also growing after reports that citizens from the United Kingdom, France and possibly other European countries were among the dead or missing. Here are some of the ways some European countries have responded since the fighting began early Saturday. In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said his government is ""poised"" to provide diplomatic, intelligence or security support, if requested, to Israel. The U. K. is one of Israel's ""strongest allies,"" he said. The government has not ruled out evacuating its citizens from affected areas, saying keeping Britons safe is its ""utmost priority. "" Sunak held a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday. The deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, said Monday evening that his government was reviewing its aid to the Palestinian territories. A spokesperson from the UK Foreign Office issued a statement saying it does not comment on individual consular cases. ""The safety of all British nationals continues to be our utmost priority and we urge everyone to continue to follow our travel advice which is updated regularly. ""German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany ""stands steadfastly by Israel's side. "" French President Emmanuel Macron condemned the attacks and said he had held talks with Prime Minister Netanyahu as well as with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Lebanon's caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati. The European Union's executive arm announced it was suspending all aid to the Palestinian territories. ""As the biggest donor of the Palestinians, the European Commission is putting its full development aid, worth a total of EUR 691m [$728 million] under review,"" Oliver Varhelyi, EU commissioner for neighbor and enlargement, said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""The scale of terror and brutality against #Israel and its people is a turning point. There can be no business as usual,"" he said. The EU will hold an extraordinary meeting of its foreign ministers Tuesday in Muscat, Oman, to discuss the situation. The BBC reported more than 10 British citizens are feared dead or missing in Israel, citing an unnamed official U. K. source. Among those killed in Israel was 20-year-old British man, Nathanel Young, who was serving in the Israel Defense Forces, according to several British news reports. The U. K. Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment. The French government said two of its citizens were killed in Israel. On Monday, French lawmaker Meyer Habib tweeted that at least eight French nationals were missing, dead or taken hostage after Hamas' attack on Israel began Saturday. He said he spoke to a man who confirmed that his son, a 26-year-old French man who was living in Israel, was taken hostage by Hamas. Germany's Foreign Ministry said it assumes German citizens are among those kidnapped by Hamas, according to Le Monde. In France and Germany, security has been ramped up at Jewish institutions, synagogues and Jewish schools. London's Metropolitan Police has also stepped up patrols after videos emerged of celebrations in the city of the attacks against Israel. Public support for Palestinian rights and sympathy for the Palestinian cause, according to surveys, has been stronger in some European countries than it is in the United States. One poll published in July by the company YouGov found that, of people in European countries with opinions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, there was a greater tendency to side with the Palestinians. The exception was Germany, where respondents were almost evenly split on the issue. This week, there have been pro-Palestinian protests in London, Berlin and some U. S. cities. Scotland's leader, First Minister Humza Yousaf, is one of those who has found his family affected by the conflict. He told journalists in Scotland on Monday that his parents-in-law were currently trapped in Gaza. The parents of Yousaf's wife, Nadia El-Nakla, who is of Palestinian heritage, had been visiting relatives in Gaza when they found themselves trapped as Israel began its attacks on the territory this weekend. The Scottish first minister said his parents-in-law had been told by Israeli authorities to leave because ""Gaza will effectively be obliterated"" but that nobody could guarantee them safe passage out. ""I'm in a situation where, frankly, night by night, day by day, we don't know whether or not my mother-in-law and father-in-law — who have nothing to do, as most Gazans don't, with Hamas or with any terror attack — whether they will make it through the night or not,"" Yousaf said.",npr_articles/article_383.txt,npr_results/article_383.txt.json

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N. J. , and Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N. Y. , traveled to Israel separately and were in different cities on Saturday, but statements from their offices suggest they shared a similar experience. Both sheltered in place in their hotels and were able to return to the U. S. the next day. Goldman had traveled to Tel Aviv with his wife and three children for a family bar mitzvah. He told TODAY that they were woken up around 6:30 a. m. by sirens and scrambled to seek shelter in a stairwell, an experience they repeated several times throughout the day as the barrage of rockets continued. ""Our experience was traumatic, but of course it is nothing compared to so many Israelis down in the south, just massacred with barbarism that we have not seen,"" he added. Goldman said he was briefed on how Israel's Iron Dome works during a visit with a congressional delegation in August, but did not expect to experience it for himself. He said what's most important in this moment — ""both in Congress and around this country"" — is standing with Israel against what he described as ""barbaric terrorism. "" Meanwhile Booker, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had arrived in Israel on Friday for meetings and site visits ahead of an N7 economic summit in Tel Aviv. He was in Jerusalem when the attacks began. Booker said in a video that he had been jogging in the Old City when he got an urgent message from his staff telling him to get back to his hotel. There he joined many other ""frightened faces"" hiding out in a stairwell. ""There were children, elderly, families, many Americans,"" Booker said. ""There was a sense of fear and worry, and a knowledge to many of us that there were horrific things going on around the country at the time. "" He added that the experience has made him even more committed to working with his colleagues to support Israel's security, as well as ensure stability — and eventually a ""long-term and just peace"" — in the region. Goldman acknowledged he was lucky to have been able to rebook his family on a flight home a day earlier than planned, since so many others have been canceled. Major airlines in the U. S. , United Kingdom, Europe and Asia have suspended flights in and out of Israel for at least the next few days, the Associated Press reports. American Airlines is halting flights until Friday, Delta until Saturday and United Airlines ""until conditions allow them to resume. ""Other Americans remain stranded in Israel, according to local media reports. Among them are two separate church groups from Alabama and a 32-member delegation of New York law enforcement officials who were in Israel for counterterrorism training. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul — whose state is home to the world's largest Jewish population outside of Israel — said she is in touch with embassies and the State Department to try to bring New Yorkers home safely. Ben Gurion International Airport remains open, the U. S. State Department said in a Monday alert, urging U. S. citizens to check their flight status with their airline and the airport. It also asks  them to fill out a crisis intake form if they need assistance, as well as monitor news outlets and follow advice from local officials. ""U. S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness as security incidents, including mortar and rocket fire, often take place without warning,"" the alert reads. The State Department confirmed on Monday morning that nine U. S. citizens are among the hundreds of people killed in the conflict, and an unspecified number of others remain unaccounted for. It says U. S. officials are working with their Israeli partners to determine their whereabouts.

385,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/09/1204639253/israel-gaza-hamas-us-citizens-killed,"Israeli forces launched unrelenting airstrikes into the densely populated Gaza Strip on Monday with the aim of rooting out Hamas forces, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Jonathan Conricus said Monday night local time. The airstrikes continued for 10 hours Monday, as Israeli forces react so ""Hamas won't be able to strike Israeli civilians ever again,"" Conricus said his video update. In an address to the country, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that the military offensive is just beginning. ""We have only started striking Hamas,"" he said. ""What we will do to our enemies in the coming days will reverberate with them for generations. ""As Israeli forces dial up their response, Hamas threatened the lives of hostages if Israel bombs homes of women, children and elderly leaders living in Gaza without warning, according to a message from the military wing of the group issued late Monday. Hamas reportedly holds scores of men, women and children. In audio released through Hamas channels on the Telegram messaging platform and other mediums, Ezzedin al-Qassam Brigades said the group will execute a civilian hostage each time Israel bombs a home without warning and would release the sound and images of that execution. ""We hold, before the world, the Zionist enemy responsible for this decision. The ball is in their court from this moment,"" said the group's spokesman, who goes by the name Abu Obeida. The unprecedented violence affecting Palestinians and Israelis comes after a Saturday morning attack by Hamas. Gunmen for the group infiltrated Israel by sea, land and air entering homes, killing civilians and capturing hostages of all ages. A rave near the border with Gaza was also attacked. Conricus called it ""by far the worst day in Israeli history. ""There are 2,300 wounded and 700 dead from these attacks, the Israeli military spokesman said. Most of the victims are civilians. Israeli media later reported the number of dead in Israel had reached 900. In retaliation for the assault from Hamas, Israel has focused its attacks on the Gaza Strip, home to 2. 3 million Palestinians, most of them refugees. Conricus said Israeli forces have regained full control of all the southern territory where there were Palestinian gunmen, three days after the initial attack from Hamas. He said 300,000 reservists have been mobilized in southern and northern Israel. Officials with the Health Ministry in Gaza said Monday that more than 680 people have been killed in Israeli strikes and more than 3,700 wounded, according to The Associated Press. Nine U. S. citizens have also died, officials from the U. S. State Department and the National Security Council confirmed Monday. Three days since the conflict began, there are still a number of unaccounted-for U. S. citizens that the State Department says it's working with its Israeli partners to help find, according to spokesman Matthew Miller. He did not provide any details about the victims or how they died. ""We extend our deepest condolences to the victims and to the families of all those affected. We continue to monitor the situation closely and remain in touch with our Israeli partners and the local authorities,"" Miller said in an emailed statement. There are still a lot of unanswered questions regarding the status of victims and hostages. Israelis fear that the attack at the rave left at least 260 people killed. NPR's Daniel Estrin spoke with Ahuva Maisel, whose 21-year-old daughter named Adi was at that festival and is still missing. ""I don't know if she's alive. I don't know if she's dead. I don't know if she's hurt. I know nothing. I don't know if somebody captured her,"" Maisel said. She said she's received phone calls from people purporting to be from Hamas. ""And they say that they have my daughter, my beautiful daughter, and I hear screaming of girls,"" Maisel said. She is unsure if the calls are fake or not. Other Israelis have said they've received videos of loved ones captive inside Gaza. Israel said as part of its full siege of Gaza that it would cut off fuel, electricity and food supplies into the area. In announcing the complete siege, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said: ""We are fighting human animals and we will act accordingly. "" Eman Abou Saeid, a woman in Gaza reached by NPR by phone on Monday, said she had just been told her cousin was killed in an Israeli airstrike. She said he was a civilian who leaves behind a wife and five children. She said that the images of Israeli civilians being killed and taken hostage are disturbing, something many do not want to see. But she said this kind of reaction was ""expected. """"We don't like to see images like that, but it's a fight,"" Saeid said. ""It's a reaction for what Gazans here living since 2006 and since the occupation started, from 1948, and no one just caring about Gaza. ""Hamas says Israeli airstrikes on Gaza overnight and into Monday morning killed four hostages and their captors from its military wing. The claim could not be verified. The group released an image of one of the alleged hostages killed in the airstrike, a 19-year-old Israeli whom Hamas identified by name and described as an Israeli soldier. The image shows him seated on the ground, with his hands behind his head and alive at that time. U. N. Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the Hamas attacks on Israel but similarly criticized the continued Israeli air strikes, as well as the plans for an all-out siege of the Gaza Strip. The situation for Gaza's residents is critical, with nearly all unable to leave the small coastal enclave due to a 16-year blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt. ""The humanitarian situation in Gaza was extremely dire before these hostilities; now it will only deteriorate exponentially. Medical equipment, food, fuel and other humanitarian supplies are desperately needed, along with access for humanitarian personnel,"" he said in remarks to the press. Guterres said two UNRWA schools sheltering displaced families in Gaza were hit by air strikes. And as heavy airstrikes continue, some 137,000 people are sheltering in UNRWA facilities. He continued, ""It's time to end this vicious circle of bloodshed, hatred and polarization.  Israel must see its legitimate needs for security materialized – and Palestinians must see a clear perspective for the establishment of their own state realized. ""Israel's military said Monday that its forces killed several militants who had infiltrated from the northern border with Lebanon, and that Israeli combat helicopters attacked in the area soon after. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad's armed wing, Al-Quds Brigades, claimed responsibility for an attempted infiltration into Israel from Lebanon. The roads in south Lebanon were overwhelmed Monday night with the traffic of civilians fleeing northwards toward the capital, Beirut. Schools have been closed in the south of the country, and, as civilians flee, hundreds of ambulances are being sent to the area.

386,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/09/1204577965/israel-intelligence-security-hamas-gaza,"Israel's intelligence and security services have been called into question for failing to anticipate the large-scale attack launched by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on Saturday. Following some reports, about 1,000 militants gunned down civilians and military targets inside Israel in an attack unprecedented in scale. According to Israeli media, at least 700 Israelis were killed and more than 2,100 were wounded. Israel responded by launching air strikes on targets in the Gaza Strip. More than 400 Palestinians have been killed and more than 2,300 injured. The death toll is likely to grow as fighting continues. ""No national intelligence agency is omniscient or flawless, but this is just a colossal failure,"" said Bruce Hoffman, a senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""It's just astonishing that this could occur. ""Israel had long prided itself on its advanced border fence and underground wall near Gaza. But on Saturday, Hamas fighters were able to breach the border fence in at least one location with explosives and with heavy equipment, according to videos from the scene. Militants also conducted an amphibious operation on the Mediterranean Sea and used paragliders to reach two dozen locations in Israel. The militant group also launched thousands of rockets, to the surprise of Israel's vaunted intelligence agencies and surveillance system. Israel is believed to be able to listen to most any phone call in Gaza, and has a large number of informants there. ""We were surprised this morning. About failures, I prefer not to talk at this point right now. We're in war. We're fighting,"" Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, said Saturday on CNN. ""They've been planning this for a long time,"" former Israeli National Security Advisor Eyal Hulata told Reuters. ""Obviously this is a very coordinated attack, and unfortunately they were able to surprise us tactically and cause devastating damage. "" In recent months, much of the Israel Defense Forces' focus has been in the West Bank, where battalions of young Palestinian men have launched their own initiative against the Israeli occupation. ""The West Bank was consuming their attention,"" said Hoffman, who has studied Israeli-Palestinian relations for the past 40 years. Israeli officials have also been preoccupied with tensions around the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the most holy Muslim site in Jerusalem, also sacred to Jews as the Temple Mount, after Israeli police conducted raids on worshipers back in April. ""There were a lot of assets and resources focused on monitoring events in Jerusalem,"" Hoffman said. The country has become increasingly divided and rife with domestic political problems. In July, Israel's parliament voted to prevent judges from striking down government decisions on the basis that they are ""unreasonable. ""The controversial changes to the judiciary, pushed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right government, sparked public outrage and mass protests. Some members of Israel's military reserve also refused to report for duty recently, though they've all reported to duty in this crisis. Hoffman said it is not a surprise that Hamas would choose to strike during a polarizing time. ""They strike precisely when they sense an opportunity,"" Hoffman said. ""When they see a gap generally in their enemy's defenses, generally caused by distraction or preoccupation with other threats or challenges. ""The assault also took place during the Jewish Sabbath and in the early hours of the Simchat Torah holiday. Israeli soldiers guarding the border wrote on social media that militants overtook their base, killing soldiers — and there were fewer troops on duty because it was a Jewish holiday. Over the past decade, Hamas has largely attacked Israel by launching rockets. As a result, Israeli forces around Gaza were not prepared for a ground assault, Hoffman said. ""They weren't at all battle ready,"" he said. ""I think there was a complacency that all was quiet on the border with Gaza. ""That should have been suspicious and concerning, he added. On the other hand, Hoffman said the sheer scale and complexity of the attack was unimaginable and overwhelming. Hoffman, who described Israel's intelligence as ""second-best"" to the U. S. , said Hamas' combination of air, land and sea attacks was ""unprecedented"" for terrorist groups in recent history. Israel and the U. S. have labeled Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, as a terrorist group. ""I can't recall any time where a group was able to put them together and stage a simultaneous coordinated assault using all three venues,"" he said.

A military spokesman said there are still breaches in the barrier between the Gaza Strip and Israel where militants could be entering the country. ""We thought this morning we'd be in a better place,"" said Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, one of the army's spokesmen. Israeli media reported more than 700 people were killed by Hamas. The Associated Press reported that militants claimed to have taken some 130 captives — including women and children. The figure is unconfirmed. Meanwhile, the Israeli military said it has struck 1,000 targets in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian health officials said at least 493 people have been killed, including 91 children and 61 women. Around 2,750 have been injured. In other areas, the Palestinian Health Ministry said 15 Palestinians have been killed since Saturday, among them two minors, and 80 wounded across six different locations in West Bank and Jerusalem. ""Where are the international community's responses to this?"" the ministry said Sunday. For some 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza, leaving Hamas-linked areas isn't so simple. On Monday, Gaza City residents faced life with no electricity and its main hospital began running low on supplies. ""I have given an order — Gaza will be under complete closure,"" Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in a statement. ""There will be no electricity, food or fuel [delivered to Gaza]. We are fighting barbaric [terrorists] and will respond accordingly. ""As of Sunday evening, the United Nations says more than 123,000 Palestinians had been displaced in Gaza. Many have sought shelter in U. N. -run schools. The U. N. also says that damage from Israeli airstrikes in Gaza has undermined the provision of water, sanitation, and hygiene services to over 400,000 people. For more than 16 years, the Gaza Strip has been under a blockade by Israel and Egypt that restricts the movement of people and goods in and out of the territory. Ruba Akkila, a resident of Gaza, said that after Israel announced it will cut off even food supplies to the territory, she saw a man looking for remains of food in a garbage bin outside her building. ""This is going to be a really difficult thing for us,"" she said. ""We are living in the unknown. We don't know if we are going to get a next meal. "" ""We are going to respond very, very severely to this,"" Hecht said earlier Sunday. ""In a way, this is our 9/11. ""On Sunday, Israel conducted hundreds of air strikes – hitting apartment buildings, Hamas members' homes and at least 10 mosques in Gaza. Pictures showed rubble surrounding a mosque that was destroyed in an Israeli air strike in Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip. It's been difficult to reach the injured as ambulances are struggling to reach people under the rubble. Several ambulances and one hospital have already been struck by Israeli airstrikes since Saturday. In some cases, Israel gives a brief warning to residents of an incoming attack. In others, there is no warning. Israel Defense Forces said its aircraft attacked two ""operational situation rooms"" used by Hamas inside mosques in Gaza. Palestinian Health Ministry Director-General Dr. Medhat Abbas told NPR on Sunday that there is no safe place to run to in Gaza. His pregnant daughter, who is a doctor herself, was unable to run on foot after she received warning of an incoming Israeli airstrike on a home near hers. He said she called him panicking, unsure what to do. He advised her to lean crouch by a wall. He said these are the conditions residents in Gaza face, and that the hospitals are not prepared with enough hospital beds nor stocked well enough for  war. ""They say we have not started yet, we have not started yet. What's the meaning of they will start? We don't know what will happen if they will start,"" he said, referring to Israel's response thus far. ""Are they planning for a big massacre in Gaza? I don't know. But they are only civilians who will pay for that. ""Early Saturday, at 6:30 a. m. local time, Palestinian militants launched a large-scale surprise attack from the blockaded Gaza Strip on civilian and military targets in Israel. They infiltrated using paragliders, an amphibious operation on the Mediterranean Sea, and on land, Hecht told reporters. Israel said Hamas fighters came in from some 29 points from Gaza to attack towns and military bases. A border fence was breached with explosives — and also with heavy equipment, according to videos from the scene. Simultaneously, Palestinian militants in Gaza fired heavy barrages of rockets toward Israel — more than 3,000 rockets throughout the day, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Air raid sirens and loud booms were heard in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and across central and southern Israel. Among the militants' targets was a dance festival being held in a rural area near the Israel-Gaza border and where thousands of young people were celebrating the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. Local rescue services said about 260 attendees were killed, while others were taken hostage. The military also confirmed that Israelis were taken hostage back to Gaza but has not said how many. Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Jonathan Conricus said ""a very large amount"" of people were taken, including women, children, infants, elderly and disabled people. Late on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed in a TV address that Israel will ""reach into every place Hamas is hiding"" and turn those locations into ruins. Israel's military is calling up reservist soldiers, reinforcing positions and launching airstrikes on targets in Gaza. Early on Monday, IDF spokesperson Conricus said the military has ""amassed around 100,000 reserve troops who are currently in southern Israel. ""Hamas, the Islamist militant group, took control of Gaza in 2007. Anyone in areas where Hamas operates in the Gaza Strip should ""leave those places now,"" Netanyahu said. He added, ""Israel will settle the score with anyone who harms them. ""In the north of the Israel, there have been strikes exchanged across the border with Lebanon, raising alarm at heightening regional tensions. Israel struck a site in Lebanon, after mortar fire into Israel that was claimed by the Hezbollah militant group. Hezbollah's involvement opens up the possibility of a multi-front conflict involving Israel, Gaza and Lebanon. There are fears the brutality could spread. An Egyptian policeman opened fire on Israeli tourists Sunday in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, killing at least two Israelis and one Egyptian, local media reported. Powers in the region have issued calls for a stop to the violence. The Saudi Foreign Ministry issued a statement calling for ""an immediate end to the escalation of the conflict. ""Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal Bin Farhan spoke with Secretary of State Antony Blinken. A Saudi statement said the kingdom rejects the targeting of civilians, and all sides should respect international humanitarian law. In Iran, hardliners have been incensed for months over reports that Saudi Arabia might establish diplomatic ties with Israel. In Tehran, the Foreign Ministry spokesman referred to Israeli visits to Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque as a ""desecration"" and called the attack a ""spontaneous move by . . . resistance groups. ""The U. S. has responded in support of Israel. President Biden said he spoke with Netanyahu Saturday morning, telling him the U. S. is ""ready to offer all appropriate means of support"" to Israel. The two spoke again Sunday for the second time this weekend. ""Terrorism is never justified,"" Biden said in a statement on Saturday. ""Israel has a right to defend itself and its people.

Within hours of the order, many Palestinians had begun to evacuate to the south of Gaza — some making the exit from Gaza City on foot. The evacuation order has drawn outcry from humanitarian groups.

389,https://www.npr.org/2023/10/07/1204436940/palestinian-militants-launch-rockets-into-israel,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel is in a state of war, after Palestinian militants launched a large-scale surprise attack from the blockaded Gaza Strip on civilian and military targets in Israel early Saturday. Hundreds of people have been killed on both sides, and an unknown number of Israelis have been taken hostage. A new day is now beginning in Gaza and Israel, and it promises more violence, even as a range of countries, from the U. S. to Israel's Arab neighbors, urge the combatants not to escalate the conflict further. But leaders on both sides say they're now at war — and that it won't be over soon. In the first day of attacks and fighting, at least 250 Israelis were killed, and more than 1,000 wounded. More than 230 Palestinians were killed, with nearly 2,000 injured, according to health officials in Gaza. The violence has ranged from close-combat ground fighting to airstrikes and rocket attacks. Questions that are now circulating range from how calm might be restored to what goals Israel might pursue in response to what it deems an invasion, and whether open warfare might derail U. S. efforts to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Here's where things stand:Israel will ""reach into every place Hamas is hiding"" and turn those locations into ruins, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed in a late-night TV address. Israel's military is calling up reservist soldiers, reinforcing positions and launching airstrikes on targets in Gaza. Hamas, the Islamist militant group, took control of Gaza in 2007. Anyone in areas where Hamas operates in the Gaza Strip should ""leave those places now,"" Netanyahu said. He added, ""Israel will settle the score with anyone who harms them. ""But for some 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza, leaving Hamas-linked areas isn't so simple. For more than 16 years, the Gaza Strip has been under a blockade by Israel and Egypt that restricts the movement of people and goods in and out of the country. Israeli airstrikes hit central Gaza City Saturday night, leveling a 14-story building that housed Hamas offices, as well as apartments, according to The Associated Press. The agency reports that Israel gave warning of the airstrike, and no casualties were reported. ""We are at war,"" Netanyahu said early Saturday, in a video statement in front of Israel's military headquarters. He vowed to exact an ""immense price from the enemy. ""Netanyahu's office says his security cabinet met and decided to shut off electricity and gas Israel supplies to Gaza and to block the import and export of goods through Israel's border crossing. In Gaza City, morgues and hospitals overflowed with families seeking news about their relatives. The streets were dark Saturday night. Local humanitarian worker Yousef Hammash, associated with the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) in Gaza, talked to NPR from Jabalia Refugee Camp.  ""We are now entirely unprepared and uncertain about how we could continue our humanitarian work the next day with a new contingency plan,"" he said, as the sound of bombardments echoed from his phone. At 6:30 a. m. local time, Palestinian militants launched a complex offensive against Israel, infiltrating by using paragliders, through an amphibious operation at the Mediterranean Sea and on land, Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht told reporters. A border fence was breached with explosives — and also with heavy equipment, according to videos from the scene. Simultaneously, Palestinian militants in Gaza fired heavy barrages of rockets toward Israel — more than 3,000 rockets throughout the day, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Air raid sirens and loud booms were heard in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and across central and southern Israel. Top Hamas militant commander Mohammed Deif called for a regional war. In a statement, he said Saturday's attacks were a response to Israeli ""desecration"" of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, a reference to Jewish religious ultranationalists who visited the holy site, also revered in Judaism as the Temple Mount, this past week during a Jewish holiday. Israeli forces and Palestinian gunmen fought each other for hours in at least five southern Israeli communities close to Gaza — the town of Sderot and the kibbutz communities of Nahal Oz, Beeri, Magen and Kfar Aza — as well as two Israeli military camps in the area, Hecht said. As of 8 p. m. local time on Saturday, Hecht said the military was still ""engaged"" with militants in 22 locations, including in situations where Israeli hostages were being held. He did not say how many hostages were taken. The head of a southern Israeli regional council was fatally shot by Palestinian militants in Kfar Aza, a council spokeswoman told Israel's public broadcaster, and one woman was reportedly killed by rocket fire in southern Israel. Israeli media reported that groups of Gaza militants drove into Israel on trucks, reaching civilian communities inside Israel. Eyewitnesses told Israel's public broadcaster that Palestinian militants roamed outside Israeli homes and opened fire at an outdoor nature festival, sending Israelis running in fields and hiding in bushes. Israeli police ordered residents of southern Israel to remain in their homes. President Biden said he spoke with Netanyahu Saturday morning, telling him the U. S. is ""ready to offer all appropriate means of support"" to Israel. ""Terrorism is never justified,"" Biden said in a statement. ""Israel has a right to defend itself and its people. ""The president said his administration's ""support for Israel's security is rock solid and unwavering. ""High-level U.

Embassy in Jerusalem urged all sides to refrain from violence and retaliatory attacks, stating, ""Terror and violence solve nothing. "" The latest violence could also threaten efforts to reach a U. S. -brokered diplomatic deal to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. On Saturday, a senior Biden administration official told reporters it's too early to say how those talks might be affected. For its part, Saudi Arabia said on Saturday that it has repeatedly warned of ""an explosive situation"" in the absence of a peace process and continued Israeli occupation. It called for restraint on both sides. Saturday's violence took place on the Jewish Sabbath and the Simchat Torah holiday, and a day after the 50th anniversary of the start of the pivotal 1973 Yom Kippur War, when Israel came under a surprise attack by Arab countries. The violence comes after recent weeks of volatile clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops along the Gaza-Israel border, and deadly Israeli military raids and clashes with Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel and militants in Gaza have fought multiple wars in the last decade and a half. In recent weeks, Egyptian mediators have reportedly sought to broker an agreement that would prevent Gaza-Israel violence, financially stabilize Hamas' government employees in Gaza and increase the number of Palestinian laborers allowed to work in Israel. Israel has also been seeing its own domestic strife, including disputes over the far-right Israeli government's efforts to weaken Israel's judiciary. But on Saturday, protest organizers canceled a large weekly demonstration. A protest group of reservist soldiers, which has led a large movement of reservists refusing to attend military trainings, called on reservists to serve if they were called up.
