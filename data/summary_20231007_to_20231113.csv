He had only recently returned to Jerusalem, to visit family after moving to the US six months earlier. Watching the attack unfold, he knew instantly that he would not be returning to the US."", 'Instead, Mr Goldberg began to pack underwear and socks, and make whatever other preparations he could to serve his country.', '""I guess in most places, you wait for the call,"" he said. ""In Israel you start to get ready before it comes.""', ""Israel is still reeling from Saturday's surprise attack by Hamas militants, who killed at least 1,000 people and wounded many more. In the few days since, the nation of more than nine million has called up a record 360,000 reservists to help respond."", ""Israel's army relies on an enormous reserve contingent, made up of civilians who have completed their compulsory national service but can be mobilised again for duty until the age of 40."", ""On Saturday afternoon, Mr Goldberg finally got the call he was waiting for. But he wasn't mobilised immediately. Sitting in his family home early on Monday morning, he was impatient to go. "", '""There is a tremendous amount of fear,"" he said. ""But you are also inspired in ways you have never been before. I realised that this is the defining moment of my life.""', ""Mr Goldberg's eagerness has been mirrored across the nation and beyond. So many reservists have felt compelled to return to duty that Israel's El Al airline announced it would run extra flights to bring home those abroad. "", 'Some who have already joined up have complained that there is not enough kit to go around. And at some muster points in Jerusalem at the weekend, volunteers were turned back because their units were already over capacity, or still catching up.', '""I drove one of my sons to the base today and they said we are not organised enough yet, come back in two days,"" said Alan Sacks, a Jerusalem lawyer and father of six.', 'Of Mr Sacks\' five sons, three had already been mobilised over the weekend. One was still trying to find a place. His youngest, aged 25, was ""very much in the hotspot at the moment,"" Mr Sacks said - working with a special forces unit near Gaza.', '""Two weeks ago, Israel was torn apart, left against right,"" he said, referring to recent large-scale protests over controversial judicial reforms. ""And now you have all these reservists lining up together to go. It\'s an extraordinary transformation.""', 'Mr Sacks was receiving updates via WhatsApp on Monday from his mobilised sons. He smiled with pride when his phone buzzed with a selfie from the 25-year-old, who had been able to communicate the least.', 'The nation\'s civilian military was ""fundamental to the existence of Israel,"" he said. ""This is not an anonymous army, everyone has a child or a cousin or a father who is involved.""', 'Calls have now gone out to reservists from their early twenties all the way up to those aged 40 - the cut-off age at which you become exempt from duty.', 'Shay, 40, a taxi driver in Jerusalem, who did not want to give his full name, was on holiday in Greece when he got the call. It had been 20 years since his national service, he said, but he had done refresher training over the years to avoid becoming rusty with a gun.', '""Even if I was exempt I would still go,"" he said. ""I want to go for me, and for my country, but I have two young children and I am scared.""', 'Elkana Bar Etan, a 38-year-old reservist, didn\'t wait for the call. ""I just texted my commander to say I\'m here, and he texted right away and said come,"" Mr Bar Etan said.', 'He was immediately deployed to the border with Lebanon, from where he spoke to the BBC. As he spoke, mortar strikes could be heard in the background. ', '""I never in my worst nightmares imagined that this would be the circumstances for being called up again,"" he said.', '""I\'m here on the border, in full uniform, and I\'m thinking about my children. But my decision was simple, really, you feel the obligation.""', ""Even the cut off age did not stop the volunteers. At Jerusalem's main bus station on Monday, Nissim Baranes, 45, was sitting in uniform waiting for a public bus south that, so far, didn't seem to be coming."", '""I think the public transport is also operating on emergency terms,"" he said.', 'Mr Baranes was doubly exempt from duty, because not only was he over 40 but he also had six children - the number that excuses a parent from being called up. ', 'And yet there he was, alone at the bus station, with a modest rucksack, trying to get himself closer to somewhere he could be useful.', '""It is a good feeling to put on the uniform again,"" he said. ""These are hard days for Israel.""', 'For some parents, this is not the first time they have watched their sons and daughters go to take part in this conflict.', ""One of Mr Sacks' sons served in the 2014 Gaza war. During that time, he and his wife Judith would sit on the front balcony of their house, dreading the appearance of a uniformed soldier walking up the driveway, Judith said."", 'That feeling was now rushing back, she said, with tears in her eyes. ""Then there was one child serving, now there are two serving and two more waiting to go in.""', 'The reservists already in position and those still waiting to go said they had no idea how long this new mobilisation would last. Israel has launched waves of retaliatory air strikes against the Gaza Strip which have killed at least 900 people. Many are expecting a ground invasion that could bring weeks of suffering.', '""There is a mixed feeling of wanting it to end now and wanting to change the Middle East,"" said Michael Goldberg, the 24-year-old reservist who was waiting impatiently to leave.

Many analysts have questioned whether this is achievable, given Hamas's historic ability to replace both its lost commanders and weaponry. "", 'The overnight raid will have provided Israeli planners with some intelligence, but the longer Israel waits to launch its incursion the more time Hamas has to prepare for it, including rebuilding some of the very defences Israel says it destroyed overnight.', 'In what, in military jargon, is known as a ""shaping operation"", the footage released by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) shows an armoured column breaking through the border wall and advancing across open sandy ground on the northern outskirts of Gaza. ', 'The grainy black and white footage, taken from thermal imaging cameras mounted on both aerial drones and vehicles, then shows tank fire engaging unidentified targets in the middle distance.

', 'Ironically, it was an ordinary civilian bulldozer that was shown in Hamas footage breaking down the Gaza border wall ahead of their raid into southern Israel on 7 October. ', 'But the vehicles used by the IDF have a specialised military purpose: to clear away obstacles, rubble and booby traps ahead of advancing troops.

', 'The engine, hydraulics and cabin all have armoured protection and the bulldozers can be fitted with machine guns, grenade launchers and what is known as an ""Active Protection System"" to fend off explosive drones.', 'If and when a full-scale Israeli incursion into Gaza begins then these armoured bulldozers will likely play a key role. But they are not indestructible, and one of the many threats the Israeli troops are expected to face will come from lethal off-route mines called Explosive Formed Projectiles (EFP), which can fire a bolt of molten metal at supersonic speed into the side of a tank or other armoured vehicle.

Not only is it, as ever, hard to penetrate the fog of war to work out what is happening on the battlefield. The new shape of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has not yet emerged. ', 'Events are still moving fast. Fears that the war could spread are very real. New realities in the Middle East are out there somewhere, but their shape and the way that they will work depend on the way this war goes for the rest of the year, and probably beyond. ', 'Here are a few things that we know, and a few that we do not. The list is not exhaustive. Some people mocked Donald Rumsfeld, US defence secretary at the time of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, when he talked of ""unknown unknowns"". But in this part of the world as much as any other, they exist - and when they emerge, they can make a big difference. ', 'One certainty is that Israelis support the military campaign to break the power in Gaza of Hamas and its junior partner, Islamic Jihad. Their anger is driven by the shock of the Hamas attacks, the killing of more than 1,400 people and the fact that around 240 hostages are still being held in Gaza. ', 'I met Noam Tibon, a retired general in the Israeli army, to hear about how he drove down with his wife to Nahal Oz, a kibbutz on the border with Gaza, after Hamas attacked on 7 October. His mission, which was successful, was to rescue his son, his daughter in law and their two young daughters who were in their safe room, hearing Hamas gunmen roaming around outside. ', 'Tibon may be retired but he is a very fit-looking 62-year-old. He ended up armed with an assault rifle and a helmet he had taken from a dead Israeli soldier, leading a group of soldiers he had assembled in the chaos of that day, clearing the kibbutz and saving the lives of his family and many others. ', 'The general was an old-school, straight-talking Israeli officer. ', '""Gaza is going to suffer… no nation will agree that your neighbour will slaughter babies, women or people. Just like you (Britons) crushed your enemy during World War Two. This is what we need to do in Gaza. No mercy."" ', 'What, I asked, about innocent Palestinian civilians who are getting killed? ', '""Unfortunately, it\'s happening. We live in a tough neighbourhood, and we need to survive… we have to be tough. We have no choice.""  ', 'A lot of Israelis are echoing his sentiment that Palestinian civilian deaths are unfortunate, but they are being killed because of the actions of Hamas. ', ""It is also clear that Israel's assault on Hamas is causing terrible bloodshed. The latest figure for Palestinian deaths from Gaza's health ministry, run by Hamas, has exceeded 9,000 - of whom around 65% are children and women. "", 'It is not clear how many of the men who have been killed were civilians or fighting for Hamas or Islamic Jihad. US President Joe Biden and the Israelis do not trust the ministry figures. But in past conflicts, Palestinian casualty statistics have been considered accurate by international organisations. ', 'One grim milestone is fast approaching. The United Nations (UN) says around 9,700 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since the full-scale Russian invasion 21 months ago.', 'Some of the Palestinian dead would have been part of Hamas. But even if that proportion is as high as 10%, which is unlikely, it means that Israel is on course to have killed as many Palestinian civilians in just over a month as Russia has killed in Ukraine since February 2022. (The UN says its data for Ukraine is incomplete and the true number of civilians killed is likely higher, while in Gaza the number of dead is also likely to be higher as many Palestinians are believed to be buried under rubble).', 'The UN human rights office has said that so many civilians have been killed and wounded in Israeli air strikes that it has serious concerns that the attacks are disproportionate and could be war crimes.', 'From the first days after the Hamas attacks, President Biden has supported Israel\'s decision to use military force to remove Hamas from power. But he has also added the qualification that it needed to be done ""the right way"". He meant that Israel should observe the laws of war that protect civilians. ', 'The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Tel Aviv. Before he took off, he said: ""When I see a Palestinian child - a boy, a girl - pulled from the rubble of a collapsed building, that hits me in the gut as much as seeing a child from Israel or anywhere else."" ', ""I have reported on all of Israel's wars in the last 30 years. I do not remember a US administration stating so publicly that Israel needs to observe the laws of war. Blinken's visit suggests that he believes Israel is not following Biden's advice. "", 'Something else we know for certain is that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under great pressure. ', ""Unlike Israel's security and military chiefs, he has not accepted any personal responsibility for the catastrophic series of failures that left Israeli border communities virtually undefended on 7 October. "", 'Last Sunday, 29 October, he caused uproar when he sent out a tweet blaming the intelligence agencies. Mr Netanyahu deleted the message and apologised.  ', ""Three Israelis, a former peace negotiator, the ex-head of the Shin Bet (Israel's internal intelligence agency) and a tech entrepreneur, wrote an article in the journal Foreign Affairs saying that Mr Netanyahu should not have any part of the war and whatever follows. The Israeli PM has loyal supporters, but he has lost the confidence of prominent figures in Israel's military and security establishment. "", 'Noam Tibon, the retired general who fought his way into kibbutz Nahal Oz to rescue his family, compares Mr Netanyahu to Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister who was forced to resign in 1940, and replaced by Winston Churchill. ', 'Tibon told me: ""This is the biggest failure in the history of the state of Israel. It was a military failure. It was an intelligence failure. And it was the failure of the government… the one really in charge - and all the blame is on him - is the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu… He is in charge of the biggest failure in the history of Israel.""', 'It is also clear that the old status quo has been smashed. It was unpleasant and dangerous, but it seemed to have a certain grimly-familiar stability. Since the end of the last Palestinian uprising around 2005 a pattern has emerged that Mr Netanyahu believed could be sustained indefinitely. That was a dangerous illusion, for all concerned - Palestinians as well as Israelis. ', 'The argument went that the Palestinians were no longer a threat to Israel. Instead, they were a problem to be managed. The tools available include sticks, carrots and the ancient tactic of ""divide and rule"". ', 'Mr Netanyahu, who has been prime minister for most of the time since 2009 - after an earlier spell between 1996 and 1999 - has argued consistently that Israel does not have a partner for peace. ', 'Potentially, it did. The Palestinian Authority (PA), which is the main rival to Hamas, is a deeply flawed organisation, and many who support it believe its aged President Mahmoud Abbas needs to step aside. But it accepted the idea of establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel back in the 1990s. ', '""Divide and rule"" for Mr Netanyahu meant allowing Hamas to build its power in Gaza at the expense of the PA. ', ""While Israel's longest-serving prime minister is always careful about what he says in public, his actions over many years show that he does not want to allow the Palestinians to have an independent state. That would involve giving up land in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which the Israeli right wing believes belongs to the Jews. "", ""From time to time, Mr Netanyahu's pronouncements would leak. In 2019, a number of Israeli sources say that he told a group of his Likud members of parliament that if they opposed a Palestinian state they should support schemes to pump money - mostly provided by Qatar - into Gaza. He told them that deepening the division between Hamas in Gaza and the PA in the West Bank would make it impossible to establish a state. "", 'It is also clear that Israel, backed by the Americans, will not tolerate a deal that allows Hamas to stay in power. That guarantees a lot more bloodshed. It also raises big questions about what or who replaces them, which so far have not been answered. ', 'The conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea has lasted for more than 100 years. One lesson of its long and bloody history is that there will never be a military solution. ', 'In the 1990s, the Oslo peace process was established to try to end the conflict by establishing a Palestinian state with a capital in East Jerusalem alongside Israel. The last attempt to revive it, after years of on-off negotiations, happened during the Obama administration. It failed a decade ago, and since then the conflict has been allowed to fester. ', 'As President Biden and many others have said, the only possible chance for avoiding more wars is to establish a Palestinian state alongside Israel. That will not be possible with the current leaders on either side.  Extremists, both Israeli and Palestinian, would do all they could to scupper the idea, as they have done since the 1990s. Some of them believe they are following the will of God, which makes it impossible to persuade them to accept a secular compromise. ', 'But if this war does not deliver enough of a shock to break deeply-held prejudices and to make the idea of two states viable, nothing will. And without a mutually-acceptable way of ending the conflict, more generations of Palestinians and Israelis will be sentenced to more wars.

So now they are attacking the people in the West Bank. God give mercy to all the martyrs in Gaza and the West Bank."" ', 'One fear often expressed by Palestinians is that Israel, in its rage, is using the crisis to try to inflict another Nakba, or catastrophe, on the scale of 1948. The evidence they cite is the way that more than a million Gazans have been forced to flee to the south of the Strip, and the threats made by some Israeli politicians to make Gaza smaller by taking tranches of land to use as buffer zones.

The massacres on 7 October have been called the worst day for the Jews since the Holocaust.

They believed the Americans were also complicit in everything Israel was doing in Gaza, including killing children. "", 'The bitter dispute over who was responsible for the attack will not change many minds. Twelve days of war have ramped up hatred and division.   ', 'Israel produced a detailed rebuttal of accusations that it had attacked Al-Ahli. It displayed evidence that it said proved a missile fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad had malfunctioned and dropped well short of its target in Israel.  ', ""For Palestinians - not just supporters of Hamas - the piles of bloodstained body bags were all the proof they needed. For them, the difference at Al-Ahli was not of principle but of degree. Israel has been killing scores of Palestinians every day since it responded to the Hamas surprise attack, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reminded Mr Biden had killed at least 1,400 people, mostly Israeli civilians. Al-Ahli was, for Palestinians, more proof of Israel's disregard for their lives. "", 'The first reports of the destruction of the hospital emerged as the engines of Air Force One were warming up to bring Joe Biden to the Middle East. Before it could take off his schedule was in tatters. ', 'President Biden has a deep commitment to Israel. It must have seemed natural to him to fly into Tel Aviv to show his support and offer a public embrace to Mr Netanyahu. ', 'Mr Biden had been hoping somehow to balance that out at a hastily-arranged summit in Amman, the Jordanian capital, where he planned to meet the king of Jordan, the president of Egypt and the Palestinian president. ', 'But Jordan cancelled because of Al-Ahli. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, hurried back to his HQ in Ramallah on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Jordan itself released statements condemning Israel. ', 'The trip became much harder for President Biden. Heads of state usually only travel on diplomatic missions once the hard work of negotiation has been done and a deal is ready to be signed. ', ""Coming to Tel Aviv was a gamble for President Biden. He wanted to ease Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, while supporting Israel's war effort - perhaps an impossible circle to square with Mr Netanyahu. "", 'But a deal emerged from their meeting. Israel was promised more military aid. In return it agreed to let convoys carrying food, water and medicine enter southern Gaza from Egypt. Hospitals are desperate for fuel for their generators, but when the deal was announced it was not mentioned. ', 'Apart from supporting the Israelis and reminding them to observe the laws of war, Mr Biden also wants to reinforce the message that the war must not spread. He had already deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups to the eastern Mediterranean, to show Iran and its ally in Lebanon, the Hezbollah militia and political movement, that they would have the US to reckon with if they intervened.', 'One reason why leaders inside and outside the Middle East are struggling with the renewed war between Hamas and Israel is because they are in unknown territory. The old certainties had become comforting assumptions. But now they are mostly shattered and gone. ', 'The Middle East looked to be familiar ground before the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October. A status quo existed. No leader in the region, and among its allies, liked it much but at the very least it seemed to promise stability.', 'Most Palestinians were as surprised as anyone else when Hamas attacked. Some had criticised Hamas for supposedly forgetting that its name is an Arabic acronym for Islamic Resistance Movement.', 'Mr Netanyahu has been condemned by his many political enemies in Israel for being asleep on the job when Hamas invaded, and for presiding over a catastrophic military and intelligence failure. Israelis thought their government could keep them safe.  ', 'Another illusion related directly to Mr Netanyahu was his assumption that the Palestinians could be managed without allowing them independence. Part of that involved making deals with Hamas over issues like the numbers of workers allowed back into Israel. ', 'At the same time, using a classic tactic of divide and rule, Mr Netanyahu worked to undermine the Palestinian Authority, the main rivals of Hamas for leadership of the Palestinians. The PA took part in years of ultimately fruitless peace talks, and recognised Israel a generation ago. But to get it talking again, Israel would have to discuss transferring land to the Palestinians for a future state with a capital in Jerusalem.  ', 'That idea is out of the question for Mr Netanyahu in his current incarnation as the leader of a government sustained by extreme religious nationalists. His record suggests he has never wanted to make those concessions. It was easier for him to find a way to insist Israel had no partner for peace. Mr Netanyahu, or a successor, will have to change their thinking if they want to find a way to save the next generation from more war. ', ""For leaders of the US's Arab allies, there has also been a sharp reminder that the Palestinians cannot be ignored. Jordan and Egypt have long-established peace treaties with Israel. The UAE normalised relations in the Abraham Accords. All were hoping to benefit from Joe Biden's plan to create a new Middle East, and a foreign policy achievement to boast about, by brokering a deal in which Israel and Saudi Arabia would recognise each other in return for security guarantees from the US. Mr Biden's officials thought they were making progress. Now a Saudi-Israeli rapprochement is way off the agenda.  "", 'And for Arab kings, princes and presidents, the war in Gaza and the attack on the hospital is also about the return of nightmares. At the end of 2010 a frustrated and furious market trader in Tunisia set himself on fire to protest against corrupt and bullying officials. It set off the Arab uprisings of 2011, which terrified leaders who thought they might lose everything - not just power and wealth but perhaps even their lives. ', 'If the death of an angry young man in Tunisia could be the spark for revolutions, what could be the price of a war that kills thousands of Palestinian civilians?  ', 'Certainties have been shown, in less than two weeks of bloodshed, to be built on sand. The new status quo will emerge from war. Perhaps the shock it creates will force new thinking. If it simply reinforces the old ways, the outlook is grim.

The fears are never-ending at this point,"" says Mr Cohen.', ""The demonstrations in the UK, attended by tens of thousands of people calling for an end to Israel's bombing of Gaza, have been viewed by him as hostile, threatening and unsettling."", 'In the most recent marches, he points to some being filmed calling for ""intifada"", the term given to violent Palestinian uprisings.', '""We\'ve seen calls for an intifada where, in the past, suicide bombings have targeted civilians, in cafes and restaurants and in nightclubs. Whether it\'s one person saying this stuff or 10 or 10,000, the chilling effect on British Jews is the same,"" says Mr Cohen', ""Although protest organisers insist the focus has been on Israel's massive bombing campaign in Gaza - and that antisemitism has not played a part - that is not how many British Jews see the marches."", '""It\'s chilling. It\'s upsetting. And it makes you feel unsafe in the place that you call home,"" says Londoner Benjamin Bell, 41, of the size of the pro-Palestinian gatherings.', 'In the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks, Mr Bell wrote a blog post that went viral in which he publicly expressed his Jewish identity, after years of being cautious about doing so, because of concerns about antisemitism. He talked of wearing a star of David pendant for the first time since his bar mitzvah.', 'Three weeks later, Mr Bell says he is once again having to weigh up whether he wears that pendant depending on the situation.', '""Unfortunately a lot of social media content is stirring up hatred and making people feel that the place that they call home may not be safe,"" he says.', 'Mr Bell talks of Jewish friends feeling anxious about antisemitism, particularly at work where they are worried about expressing support for Israel.', 'Although  he was born and raised in the UK, he says he was profoundly affected by the killings and kidnappings in Israel.', '""The Holocaust cast a long shadow over the Jewish spirit and we feel that the state of Israel provides that sanctity, that safe haven, that last resort - it goes to the very heart of my being,"" he says.', 'It is why Mr Bell says he feels unnerved by the demonstrations and particularly by the use of slogans like ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,"" referring to the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. He feels it can only mean the destruction of the Israeli state in its current form.', 'The Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which helps organise the demonstrations, contests this interpretation of that particular chant, saying the slogan refers to ""the right of all Palestinians to freedom, equality and justice"".', 'Activists also point to the make up of the pro-Palestinian protests as evidence they are not antisemitic.', '""There are hundreds of Jews on the demonstration. In fact, I\'ve never experienced the more beautiful energy.

It\'s painful,"" Mr Sayle says.', 'Referring to the ""river to the sea"" chant, he insists it is not meant to mean the eradication of Jews in the region. ', 'But while he fully understands the need for Jews to have somewhere they feel safe, he acknowledges that he, and other campaigners, are calling for a change in the way Israel sees itself as a Jewish country.', '""I think that to have a state called Israel, which has a right of return and is a state in which Jews live in beautiful harmony with everybody else, is fine,"" Mr Sayle says.', '""But if that safe haven depends on brutalising other people, stealing other people\'s land, then it\'s not a safe haven,"" he says, challenging Israel\'s assertion that its actions are necessary to maintain security.', 'While there is debate over the nature and intent of some slogans at demonstrations, a huge rise in incidents of anti-Jewish hate in the UK of the past few weeks is irrefutable. Similar spikes in antisemitic incidents accompanied Israel-Gaza violence in 2009, 2014 and 2021.', '""We are unfortunately used to it to some extent, but we do feel that we should be feeling safer here in England, children should feel comfortable to come to school in the morning and not get harassed,"" says Abraham Schechter, headteacher of the Beis Chinuch Lebonos Jewish Girls School in north London.', 'Staff and students arrived at school one morning to find red paint had been thrown at the front gates. Another Jewish school close by was also vandalised in a similar way.', '""Everybody\'s very tense, very worried, especially the pupils. We had discussions telling them not to loiter around on the streets and just to go straight home [after school], but they should not suffer here for what is happening over there,"" Mr Schechter says.', 'There are concerns that the longer the conflict goes on, the more intensely and profoundly it will affect British Jews right across the spectrum.', 'Additional reporting by Harry Farley', 'Have your family or friendship groups had disagreements over the Israel-Gaza war?

Israelis are shocked and outraged that gunmen were able to breach their southern border so easily and then murder at least 1,200 people, most in cold blood.', 'Palestinians, and not just Hamas, are reeling from the onslaught of more than 2,000 Israeli airstrikes on Gaza that have killed more than 1,000 people since Saturday. Gaza has been cut off from fuel, electricity, water and medicine.', 'Hamas has threatened to ""execute"" one hostage for each time an Israeli airstrike kills civilians without warning. There is no evidence they have done so yet. At the same time there is little sign of restraint from Israel. Large parts of Gaza are being intentionally reduced to rubble.', 'However Milstein believes that Hamas may not be keen to hold on to its women, children and the elderly. They are bad optics for the group internationally and many will require a high degree of care, not easy amid constant air strikes and when Hamas are trying to keep their location secret from any covert informants Israel may have inside Gaza.', 'By contrast, Hamas will want to take maximum advantage of any serving military personnel it holds, extracting the highest price for their release if negotiations take place.', 'This leaves the Israeli government with a dilemma when it comes to the hostages. Does it attempt an armed rescue mission, something fraught with risks? Or does it wait for longer, until Hamas is so weakened by airstrikes, that it might be more willing to make a deal? ', 'That option carries its own risks. Although the hostages are thought to be held below ground in tunnels and bunkers, they may not be immune to these airstrikes. There is always the risk that their captors could kill them, either in a fit of rage or if they feared they were on the point of being rescued. This happened in Nigeria in 2012 during a failed UK-Nigerian Special Forces mission to rescue two hostages held by jihadists.', 'Israel has been quick to set up a Hostage Situation Room, collating everything it knows on the identity and status of each of the hostages who were dragged at gunpoint across the border into Gaza on Saturday. ', 'Those who were still being held on Israeli territory were rescued by Israeli military and police Special Forces, with all their Hamas captors killed. But Michael Milstein, who spent 20 years in Israeli military intelligence, warns that ""we don\'t have all the data on every house and street in Gaza"". This is where Hamas are on home ground, able to conceal both themselves and their hostages in a network of underground cellars and tunnels. ', ""Israel has a well-proven expertise in hostage rescue, which it trains for intensively. Set up in 1957, its secretive Sayeret Matkal unit is broadly similar to Britain's SAS or America's Delta Force. It shot to fame in 1976 with its Raid on Entebbe where its commandos rescued hostages from a hijacked plane at a Ugandan airport."", ""The commander of that unit was Yonatan Netanyahu, the only fatality amongst the Israeli commandos. Today his brother Benjamin is Israel's Prime Minister and it is with him that the decision rests as to whether to wait it out in the hopes of a negotiated release of the hostages or go in hard in the hopes of rescuing them by force."", 'Reports are emerging that the US is providing assistance with intelligence data and possibly even support from its own Special Forces. A large US Navy carrier group is positioning itself offshore in the eastern Mediterranean.', ""But Hamas have shown themselves capable of asymmetric warfare, of being able to make up for Israel's massive advantage in technology and firepower. "", 'By avoiding leaving a digital trail in their communications and keeping those communications to a minimum, they were able to take Israel by surprise on 7 October. Their gunmen who are currently holding those 150-plus hostages will be staying offline and off the airwaves as far as possible and will almost certainly have removed every digital device from their captives.', '""This is without question,"" says Michael Milstein, ""the most difficult hostage situation Israel has ever faced in its history"".', 'Are you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

To put those figures into perspective, the London Underground is 400km long and is mostly above ground.', 'Tunnel construction began in Gaza before Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005.', 'But it was ramped up after Hamas took control of the Strip two years later, which prompted Israel and Egypt to begin restricting the movement of goods and people in and out for security reasons.', 'At its peak, almost 2,500 tunnels running underneath the Egyptian border were used to smuggle in commercial goods, fuel and weapons by Hamas and other militant groups. ', 'The smuggling became less important to Gaza after 2010, when Israel began allowing more goods to be imported through its crossings. Egypt later shut the smuggling down by flooding or destroying the tunnels.', 'Hamas and other factions also started digging tunnels to attack Israeli forces.', 'In 2006, militants used one underneath the border with Israel to kill two Israeli soldiers and seize a third, Gilad Shalit, who they held captive for five years.', 'In 2013, the IDF discovered a 1.6km-long, 18m-deep tunnel lined with a concrete roof and walls leading from the Strip to land near an Israeli kibbutz after residents heard strange sounds.

', 'Building the network has also come at a cost to the local population. The IDF has accused Hamas of diverting millions of dollars given to Gaza in aid to pay for the tunnels as well as tens of thousands of tons of cement intended for rebuilding homes destroyed in previous wars.', ""It is possible that a cross-border tunnel was used by Hamas militants during last weekend's attacks in Israel, in which at least 1,300 people were killed, most of them civilians, and more than 150 others were taken as hostages. There were reports that a tunnel exit was discovered near the kibbutz of Kfar Aza, where dozens of civilians were massacred."", 'If that is confirmed, the tunnel would have been built beneath the underground concrete barrier studded with sophisticated anti-tunnel detection sensors which Israel finished installing at the end of 2021. ', 'Dr Richemond-Barak says it would be a shock, but stresses that no tunnel detection system is fool-proof. ""This is why tunnels have been used for time immemorial in war, because is there no way to prevent them.""', ""She also cautions that it is unrealistic for the Israeli establishment and general public to believe it will be possible for the IDF to destroy Hamas's entire network of tunnels in Gaza, as hundreds of thousands of troops mass nearby for a possible ground operation."", '""There will be parts of the network where civilians, for whatever reason, will not evacuate... Some parts of the underground network are unknown. And for some of them the collateral damage will be too high.""', 'Destroying the tunnels will also lead to a significant loss of life - among Israeli forces on the ground, Palestinian civilians and the hostages, she warns. ', 'More than 1,500 Palestinians in Gaza, many of them civilians, have already been killed in retaliatory Israeli air strikes since Saturday.', '""Hamas is very good at using human shields. Once a strike is imminent and they know it, they will put innocent civilians on top of buildings. That has forced Israel to cancel strikes many times,"" Dr Richemond-Barak says.', '""Having mastered the technique, Hamas could easily use it in the context of the tunnels and simply put Israeli, American and other hostages inside them.""', ""During the 2021 conflict, a series of devastating air strikes in Gaza City brought three residential buildings crashing to the ground, killing 42 people. The IDF said it targeted underground tunnels, but that when they collapsed the building's foundations collapsed too."", 'The tunnel network will also negate the advantages that the IDF has in terms of technology and intelligence, magnify the difficulties of urban warfare, and pose a lethal threat to Israeli troops, according to Dr Richemond-Barak.', '""First of all, Hamas has had plenty of time to booby-trap the entire network,"" she says. ""They could just let the soldiers enter into the tunnel network and then eventually blow the whole thing up.""', '""They could kidnap [the soldiers in surprise attacks]. And then you have all the other risks - running out of oxygen, fighting the enemy in one-on-one combat, and rescuing wounded soldiers becomes virtually impossible.""', 'She adds: ""Even if you don\'t go inside the tunnel, to secure an area where you suspect that tunnels might be present is very different from just securing an area in general. Here, you have to secure something that is invisible.""', 'The Israeli forces will, however, have some ways to mitigate the risks.', 'According to Colin Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group security consultancy, these might include sending drones and unmanned vehicles into tunnels to map them and identify booby traps before soldiers clear them.

Wars, treaties and occupation mean the shape of the Jewish state has changed over time, and in parts is still undefined.

After World War One and the collapse of the empire, territory known as Palestine - the portion of which west of the River Jordan was also known as the land of Israel by Jews - was marked out and assigned to Britain to administer by the victorious allied powers (soon after endorsed by the League of Nations). ', 'The terms of the mandate entrusted Britain with establishing in Palestine ""a national home for the Jewish people"", so long as doing so did not prejudice the civil and religious rights of non-Jewish communities there.

"", ""Britain handed the problem to the United Nations, which in 1947 proposed partitioning Palestine into two states - one Jewish, one Arab - with the Jerusalem-Bethlehem area to become an international city. The plan was accepted by Palestine's Jewish leadership but rejected by Arab leaders."", 'The Jewish leadership in Palestine declared the establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948, the moment the British mandate terminated, though without announcing its borders. ', ""The following day Israel was invaded by five Arab armies, marking the start of Israel's War of Independence. The fighting ended in 1949 with a series of ceasefires, producing armistice lines along Israel's frontiers with neighbouring states, and creating the boundaries of what became known as the Gaza Strip (occupied by Egypt) and East Jerusalem and the West Bank (occupied by Jordan). "", 'The surrounding Arab states refused to recognise Israel, meaning its borders remained unset.', ""The biggest change to Israel's frontiers came in 1967, when the conflict known as the Six Day War left Israel in occupation of the Sinai peninsula, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and most of the Syrian Golan Heights - effectively tripling the size of territory under Israel's control. Israel effectively annexed East Jerusalem - claiming the whole of the city as its capital - and the Golan Heights. "", 'These moves were not recognised by the international community, until the US changed its official position on the matter under the Trump administration, becoming the first major power to do so. Overwhelmingly, international opinion continues to consider East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights as occupied territory.', ""One of Israel's land borders was formalised for the first time in 1979, when Egypt became the first Arab country to recognise the Jewish state. Under the treaty, Israel's border with Egypt was set and Israel withdrew all its forces and settlers from the Sinai, a process which was completed in 1982. "", 'That left Israel in occupation of the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, with its frontiers (excluding that of Egypt) still delineated by the 1949 armistice lines.', ""In 1994, Jordan became the second Arab state to recognise Israel, formalising its long border with the Jewish state in the process. While there has not yet been a peace treaty between Israel and Lebanon, the two countries' 1949 armistice line serves as Israel's de facto northern border, while Israel's border with Syria remains unsettled. "", 'Similarly, Israel has had a de facto border with Gaza since it pulled its troops and settlers out in 2005, but Gaza and the West Bank are considered a single occupied entity by the UN, and the official borders have not yet been determined.

What we are saying is the violence will end when there\'s justice, and people are living with dignity.""', 'The speakers at the rally condemned the loss of all civilian life and held a moment of silence.

""We\'re feeling lonely here in the university. There are some people who supports us, but I\'m afraid to say that I\'m a Jew.""', ""Other students held strongly partisan stances on the conflict.

', 'The walkie-talkie was allowed to be on because the Sabbath can be broken for matters of life and death, but it wasn\'t until sundown that Frankel could look at his phone and he fully understood the scale of the attack. He grabbed his kit, containing body bags, surgical gloves, shoe covers and rags for soaking up blood, and jumped in his car. ""I just drove,"" he said.', 'Zaka was formally established in 1995 but has roots dating back to 1989, when its founder was one of a group of religious volunteers who gathered to recover remains after a suicide attacker seized the wheel of a public bus in Israel and drove it into a ravine. ', 'There is no equivalent organisation in the UK, where professional police teams recover human remains. But in Jewish custom, bodies should be collected to the fullest extent possible and all the available remains buried together.

It was still dark when Frankel arrived, and Israeli soldiers were still exchanging gunfire with Hamas, so he lay on the sand waiting until it was safe. Then he went to work.', 'Zaka volunteers have been working since at all the sites of the attack. They retrieve the bodies in two-hour shifts because the work is so tough.

""The dead cannot pay you back.""', 'On Wednesday evening, the Zaka volunteers had just finished the last of their work collecting remains in southern Israel and Frankel was driving an hour north to the military base where the bodies were being processed.', 'Inside the base, there were about 20 massive cold storage units, like shipping containers, lined up to hold the bodies. The rabbis and Zaka volunteers were doing everything in their power to preserve the dignity of the dead, despite the scale of the operation and the condition of some of the remains. They took care to pause and say prayers over each person, where possible, and the orthodox among the workers gathered every 15 minutes to say their own prayers while the work continued around them.', 'Yacoub Zechariah, 39, the deputy mayor of Frankel\'s home city of Bnei Brak, was on his fifth straight overnight shift for Zaka at the base.

Some of the dead children had their hands and feet tied with phone cables. ', 'Zechariah pulled a body bag from a truck with a family name written on it in marker. The next bag had the same name, and the next. Eventually he had pulled five members of the same family from the truck. They were two parents and three young children who had been murdered by Hamas in their home in the kibbutz in Kfar Azza.', '""Seeing an entire family killed is something that breaks a human being,"" Zechariah said. ""I have five children of my own. We are people of faith and we know that everything comes from God, but this is difficult for us to understand.""', 'When Zechariah had checked the faces of the family and they had been moved into storage, he walked to the edge of the area where the bodies were being processed and wept. A few hours later, at 5am, he finished his shift and sat quietly in his car to drink a coffee and smoke a cigarette. Then he drove half an hour home to his family in Bnei Brak, slept for two hours and drove to City Hall to begin his day as deputy mayor.', 'Outside the gates at the base, away from the horrors inside, family members of the dead were camped on lawn chairs on the roadside, supported by food trucks and donations from local residents.

""We are five days now after the event and this has an effect on the bodies, you understand? We cannot have any mistakes.""', 'For Jewish people, a delay in burying a body can add enormous pain to the loss. They believe that a person should be buried as soon as possible so that their soul can rise up to heaven. And until the dead are buried, the family cannot begin formally to grieve.

Zaka is also involved in these final stages of the process. Many of the bodies go from the military base to a Zaka-run centre in Tel Aviv, where on Thursday volunteer Israel Hasid was painstakingly preparing to receive them. He expected that the work would continue around the clock and through the weekend, so he had sought special permission from a rabbi to work on the Sabbath.', 'There will be some police presence at the centre for technical exams involving DNA and dental records, but otherwise Hasid and the other Zaka Tel Aviv volunteers will take responsibility for all of the purification necessary before burial. They will wash the bodies in water taken from a river that runs alongside the building and gently clean them with cotton. They will cut their hair and nails if needed. ', '""In these circumstances, because of the nature of this attack, in many cases the job cannot be perfect,"" Hasid said. ""But we will do everything we can.""', ""At the end of the process, the Zaka volunteers would wrap each person's remains carefully in a white linen sheet and pass them on to undertakers to be buried, he said, so that the souls of the dead could escape and their families could begin to grieve."", 'Idan Ben Ari contributed to this report.

Israel said a misfiring rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was to blame, which they deny.', 'The UK said on Monday its assessment, based on intelligence and analysis by weapons experts, was that it was likely a missile fired from within Gaza towards Israel was responsible. French military intelligence also came to this conclusion.', 'The US had already said Israel was not to blame based on ""overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information"". The US - along with the UK and France - has not released the evidence that underpins their assessments.', ""Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said almost 500 were killed. The Israeli military said the number was far lower. "", 'Within 24 hours of the blast - which happened at 1900 local time on 17 October - the BBC Verify team had assessed video footage, pictures and other materials in an effort to understand what might have happened. A BBC journalist was also able to visit the site the day after the blast. ', 'We have continued to look closely at the evidence and there has been further analysis from other media outlets as well as dozens of open-source intelligence experts on social media.', ""There are three areas which have been a focus since the blast: the lack of weapon fragments, the crater and damage at the scene, and video footage of a projectile rising over Gaza which was central to Israel's description of what happened."", 'It is sometimes the case that what cannot be seen is as telling as what can be seen. ', 'Usually one of the most important elements in investigating incidents of this kind is an on-the-ground investigation, including examining and recovering debris that might provide clues about the nature and origin of the weapon.', ""Pictures taken in the immediate aftermath show Hamas-led security forces on the scene, with officers wearing tops with logos of the Palestinian police's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit examining the crater."", 'But we have not seen any evidence of weapon fragments being recovered and there has been no significant update from officials in Gaza about their investigation. ', 'Hamas told the New York Times that the missile had disintegrated beyond recognition. ""The missile has dissolved like salt in the water. It\'s vaporised. Nothing is left,"" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official. ', 'Experts have said it is extremely unusual for a blast site such as this not to yield debris of this kind.', 'Former UN war crimes investigator Marc Garlasco tweeted: ""In 20 years of investigating war crimes this is the first time I haven\'t seen any weapon remnants. And I\'ve worked three wars in Gaza."" ', 'The most important evidence remains the state of the scene of the blast, which was clearly photographed by news agencies the morning after. ', 'What was clear in the immediate aftermath of the blast was that it left only a small crater.  Three experts told us the crater was much smaller than the damage usually caused by the sort of precision-guided munition often used by Israel.  ', 'These weapons are often used to flatten buildings or destroy underground structures like tunnels - and if one were to have dropped in the middle of the courtyard, several experts told us, it would have left a crater metres wide and deep.', 'Since then, some commentators have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an ""air burst"" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this.', 'Those experts concurred that the pattern of damage on the ground meant the most likely cause was a rocket or a smaller munition.', ""The hospital's car park contained more than a dozen burned-out cars, including one that had been overturned."", 'There were damaged tiles, broken windows and shrapnel marks on surrounding hospital buildings but no visible structural damage. ', 'J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the US, said the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.', 'Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), agreed. ', 'While it was difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he said, the evidence suggested the explosion was a result of a section of a failed rocket hitting the car park and its fuel and propellant (a combination of fuel and an oxidizer agent) causing a fire.', 'However in the past week, not every analysis has agreed with this. ', 'The Forensic Architecture agency, a UK-based organisation which investigates human rights abuses, has carried out its own analysis of the crater, and suggests it is more consistent with the impact marks from an artillery shell which it concludes came from the direction of Israel.', 'It says that the scarring patterns above the crater are consistent with the shrapnel damage that would be expected from an artillery strike.', 'Several types of artillery have been deployed by Israel since the start of the conflict, including M109 155mm howitzers and M270 MLRS rocket launchers. ', 'We have since showed images of the crater to several weapons experts and asked them whether the damage markings were consistent with the type of explosion caused by artillery shelling. ', 'NR Jenzen-Jones, a director at Armament Research Services, says the crater is significantly smaller than one typically generated by a 155mm artillery projectile.', 'But Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that, based on evidence so far, it was difficult to differentiate whether it was caused by an artillery shell, a mortar or a rocket - it could potentially be any of them. ', ""It's unlikely that evidence from the crater alone will help us understand exactly what caused this. "", 'Aside from images of the scene in the immediate aftermath, several video clips have emerged showing the explosion and the moments leading up to the blast.', 'We synced three video clips showing the moment of the explosion - one from the Al Jazeera news network, one from a CCTV camera, and another taken on a mobile phone near to the blast site. ', 'The Al Jazeera clip, shown in the bottom left above, has been pointed to by the Israeli authorities as evidence for their claim of a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza.', 'It shows an object moving through the sky, appearing to break apart, and then, a few seconds later, another explosion on the ground.

Nine of them are yet to respond, five would not comment, but we spoke to experts at the remaining six. ', 'We asked whether the available evidence - including the size of the explosion and the sounds heard beforehand - could be used to determine the cause of the hospital blast.

', 'J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University, in the US, says the ground explosions appeared to be small, meaning that the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.', 'Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute, agrees. While it is difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he says, the evidence looks like the explosion was caused by a failed rocket section hitting the car park and causing a fuel and propellant fire.', 'Mr Gannon says it is not possible to determine whether the projectile struck its intended target from the footage he has seen. He adds that the flashes in the sky likely indicate the projectile was a rocket with an engine that overheated and stopped working.', 'Valeria Scuto, lead Middle East analyst at Sibylline, a risk assessment company, notes that Israel has the capacity to carry out other forms of air strike by drone, where they might use Hellfire missiles. These missiles generate a significant amount of heat but would not necessarily leave a large crater.

Instead, it was clear that this summit and its intended message of unity was aimed at Israel's biggest backer - the United States. Leaders want the Biden administration and the West in general to exert sufficient pressure on Israel to stop the war altogether."", 'But what they could not agree on was how to achieve that. The summit pulled together some strange bedfellows - an indication of just how worried the region is at events in Gaza spiralling beyond their control. ', ""Iran - Israel's main adversary - attended, with President Ebrahim Raisi striding across the carpeted halls in his black, cleric's robes, flanked by his scowling security men in dark suits and collarless shirts. This in itself was a surprising sight. "", 'Until they patched over their differences in March this year, Saudi Arabia and Iran were arch rivals exchanging venomous mutual accusations. They still have competing agendas, with Iran backing what many call its ""proxy militias"" - Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. ', 'The Saudis, together with their conservative Arab allies like Egypt and Jordan, see these movements as dangerous destabilisers.', 'As he departed Tehran airport for Riyadh, President Raisi said that now was the time for action over Gaza, not words. ', 'But anyone expecting concrete, punitive actions against the US or the UK was left disappointed. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which only recently opened full diplomatic, trade and security ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, resisted calls to break them off.', ""Syria's President Bashar al-Assad was also at the summit. Until very recently he was a pariah in the Arab world for the repressive actions of his regime in Syria's civil war. He told the summit it would achieve little without concrete measures, but suggestions of an oil embargo or the expulsion of US bases from Arab countries were quietly batted away."", 'Yet there is no denying that the 7 October Hamas raid and the ensuing war has changed the whole paradigm in the Middle East.', ""Up until that murderous morning in southern Israel the tectonic plates of regional politics were shifting away from the interests of Iran and its militant allies. Six Arab nations had already established full ties with Israel; Saudi Arabia was well on the way to being next. The Israeli tourism minister visited Riyadh just days before the Hamas raid. Dubai has been luring Israeli tourists in large numbers and there has been a huge Arab appetite for Israel's expertise in technology, surveillance, bio-tech and other sectors."", 'With the exception of Qatar, which hosts the exiled political leaders of Hamas, Gulf Arab rulers had grown tired of what they saw as the corruption, inefficiency and infighting of Palestinian leadership. While sympathetic to the plight of ordinary Palestinians, still without a state after 75 years, they largely took the view that Israel was too important a nation to ignore, and that it was time to move on and normalise ties with it. The question of a future Palestinian state, while still featuring in speeches, was getting little practical attention.', 'Today, those Arab-Israeli ties, while not yet broken, are certainly fraying at the edges. ', '""We are really worried about the radicalisation of our youth,"" one Arab foreign minister told me on background. ""They watch what is happening in Gaza on TV and they are increasingly angry."" ', 'Time and again I heard delegates complain that the actions of the Netanyahu government have gone far beyond self-defence and are now dragging the region down a dangerous path. There are concerns that extremist narratives are gaining popularity online.', ""Arab and Muslim leaders are frustrated that the UN Security Council has failed in their eyes to exercise any restraint on Israel's military in Gaza. America's opposition to a ceasefire has deeply embarrassed those countries it calls allies in the region. "", ""Washington's strategic alliance with the oil-rich Gulf Arab states dates back to 1945 and a wartime meeting on a US warship in the Red Sea between President Eisenhower and the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz. Today, the US still provides the bulk of Saudi and Gulf Arab defence and security needs."", 'But below the surface things are changing. Ever since the Obama administration\'s ""pivot to Asia"" there has been a fear here in the Gulf that the US is losing interest in the region, that it cannot be relied upon as a loyal partner. At the same time, the influences of Moscow and Beijing are in the ascendant. China recently brokered the rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia. President Putin has impressed Arab leaders with his unstinting support for Syria\'s President Assad. They compare this with how quickly Washington abandoned Egypt\'s President Mubarak in 2011 when the crowds came out on Cairo\'s Tahrir Square.', 'None of this means the West has lost the friends it had in the Middle East. Those Arab allies are clearly reluctant to go beyond angry words with Washington. But they do want to be heard and for the violence in Gaza to stop now, before events in the region and in their own countries risk deteriorating far beyond their control.']",Arab and Muslim leaders blame West for Gaza misery,Arab and Muslim leaders blame West for Gaza misery,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67417570

', 'The dead would be buried and Israel would be arguing with the United Nations about how much cement could come into Gaza for rebuilding. ', 'But this war is not like that. It is not just because of the enormity of the killing, first by Hamas on 7 October, mostly of Israeli civilians, followed by Israel\'s ""mighty vengeance"" as its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it, which has mostly killed Palestinian civilians. ', ""This war is different to the others because it comes at a time when the fault lines that divide the Middle East are rumbling. For at least two decades, the most serious rift in the region's fractured geopolitical landscape has been between the friends and allies of Iran, and the friends and allies of the United States. "", 'The core of Iran\'s network, sometimes called the ""axis of resistance"", is made up of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis in Yemen and assorted Iraqi militias that are armed and trained by Iran. The Iranians have also supported Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza. ', ""Iran is also getting closer to Russia and China. Iran has become a significant part of Russia's war effort in Ukraine. China buys a great deal of Iranian oil. "", 'The longer the war in Gaza goes on, and as Israel kills more Palestinian civilians and destroys tens of thousands of homes, the greater the risk of conflict involving some members of those two camps. ', 'The border between Israel and Lebanon is heating up, slowly and steadily. Neither Israel nor Hezbollah want a full-scale war. But as they trade increasingly heavy punches, the risks of uncontrolled escalation will grow. ', ""The Houthis in Yemen have been launching missiles and drones towards Israel. They have all been brought down, so far, by Israel's air defences or by US Navy warships in the Red Sea. "", 'In Iraq, militias supported by Iran have attacked American bases. The US retaliated at some of their sites in Syria. Again, all sides are trying to limit escalation, but controlling the tempo of military action is always difficult. ', ""On America's side are Israel, the Gulf oil states, Jordan and Egypt. The US continues to give strong support to Israel, even though it is clear that President Joe Biden is uncomfortable about the way Israel is killing so many Palestinian civilians. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has said publicly that too many Palestinian civilians are being killed. "", ""America's Arab allies have all condemned what Israel is doing and called for a ceasefire. The sight of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fleeing their homes in northern Gaza and walking down the main road south raises the ghosts of Israel's victory over the Arabs in its independence war in 1948. "", 'More than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes at gunpoint by the Israelis, events referred to by Palestinians as al Nakba - the catastrophe. The descendants of the 1948 refugees include much of the population of the Gaza Strip. ', ""Dangerous talk by some of the extreme Jewish nationalists who are supporting the government of Benjamin Netanyahu about imposing another Nakba on Palestinians is alarming Arab states in America's camp, particularly Jordan and Egypt. One minister in Netanyahu's government even mused about dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza to deal with Hamas. He was reprimanded but not sacked. "", 'All that can be dismissed as the ravings of the lunatic fringe, but it is being taken seriously in Jordan and Egypt. Not nuclear weapons, of which Israel has a large and undeclared arsenal, but the prospect of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians being forced over their borders. ', 'As for the war itself in Gaza, senior western diplomats from countries that are firm allies of Israel\'s allies, told the BBC that ending the war, and dealing with the aftermath will be ""difficult and messy"". ', 'One said that ""the only way through will be rebuilding a political horizon for Palestinians"". That was a reference to an independent Palestine alongside Israel, the so called two-state solution, a failed idea that survives only as a slogan. ', 'Reviving it, perhaps in the context of a wider accommodation between Israel and the Arabs, is an ambitious plan, and perhaps the best idea around. But in the current atmosphere of pain, alarm and hatred it will be very difficult to deliver. ', ""It won't happen under the current leaderships of both Palestinians and Israelis. "", ""Prime Minister Netanyahu has not revealed his plan for the day after the fighting ends in Gaza, but he has rejected America's idea of installing a government led by the Palestinian Authority, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas and ejected by Hamas from Gaza in 2007. "", 'The second part of the American plan is for negotiations on a two-state solution, something that Benjamin Netanyahu has opposed throughout his political life. ', ""Not only is Mr Netanyahu against independence for the Palestinians. His survival as prime minister depends on support from Jewish extremists who believe the entire territory between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean was given to the Jewish people by God and should all be inside Israel's borders. "", 'Many Israelis want him out, blaming him for the security and intelligence failures that allowed the attacks of 7 October to happen. ', 'The Palestinian President Abbas is in his late 80s and is discredited in the eyes of potential voters, though he has not subjected himself to the ballot box since 2005. The Palestinian Authority cooperates with Israel on security in the West Bank but cannot protect its own people from armed Jewish settlers. ', ""Leaderships change, eventually.

Now, most of them are dead, he says.', 'They were killed in an air strike which struck the family home on 22 October. In total, 21 people were killed including his father, three sisters, two brothers and 14 of their children.', ""More than 11,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli bombardment, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The air strikes began after the 7 October attack by Hamas, in which Israel says about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken hostage."", 'Israel says its strategy in Gaza has been to root out Hamas which it accuses of operating in the heart of civilian communities - and that it takes steps to mitigate civilian casualties.', ""In Ahmed's photo, only seven of the children who were killed appear.

At first, I mistook her for a boy because her hair was short. It must have burned in the fire, Ahmed said.', 'Malak\'s father wasn\'t in the house when it was hit and he is alive. But his wife and two other children were killed. When Ahmed messaged him to ask how he was doing, he replied: ""A body, no soul.""', ""A week after the bomb, communications from Gaza were almost entirely cut off as Israel escalated its attack, and Ahmed couldn't contact anyone.

How much closer is it to achieving that goal, and is it achievable? "", 'As far as Israel is concerned, these are still early days - it has repeatedly said that this operation will be long and difficult. One senior Israel Defense Forces (IDF) official who spoke to the BBC used the analogy of a boxing match: ""This is just round four of 15.""', 'No-one in Israel is saying exactly how long the war will last. Some point to the fact that it took nine months for Western-backed Iraqi forces to retake the city of Mosul from the Islamic State (IS)group in 2017. Israel may want to carry on fighting for several more months, though it may not control the timetable, as international pressure for pauses in the fighting or even a ceasefire are growing. ', 'So far, Israel says it has carried out more than 14,000 strikes and killed dozens of high-value targets, including senior Hamas commanders. Each of those strikes will have involved multiple weapons. Yaakov Katz, a military expert and former editor of the Jerusalem Post newspaper, says Israel has already fired more than 23,000 munitions. ', 'As a comparison, at the height of the battle for Mosul, Western allies dropped around 500 bombs a week on IS targets.', 'More than 10,800 people in Gaza have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 4,400 children.', 'The military says its ground forces have successfully divided the Gaza Strip between north and south, and that its troops have surrounded Gaza City. It claims they are now ""deep in the heart of the city"", though that is still far from claiming control. Hamas has denied that Israeli forces have made any significant gains or pushed deep into Gaza City.', ""This initial phase of Israel's ground offensive appears to be going according to plan with its aim of isolating Hamas, and the cost to Hamas is likely to have been high. Estimates at the start of the war suggested that the group had between 30,000-40,000 fighters. "", ""One senior Israeli defence source told the BBC that about 10% of that total - 4,000 fighters - have been killed. Such estimates are impossible to verify and should be treated with caution, but the sheer scale of Israel's bombing campaign will have already degraded Hamas's ability to fight."", 'In contrast, Israeli military losses appear to have been relatively low. Israel says 34 of its soldiers have been killed since ground operations began. Yossi Kuperwasser, an Israeli intelligence and security expert, says the military is conducting its ground operations ""more carefully and cautiously"" to avoid heavy casualties among its troops.', ""It's still not clear how much of Hamas remains in the north, how many fighters may still be hiding in tunnels, or how many might have melted into the local population who have fled south."", 'The tunnels still present a significant challenge to Israel. Its forces are trying to blow up what tunnels it finds, rather than engage in fighting underground. ', ""More obvious is Israel's significant advantage in terms of intelligence and military capabilities. It can intercept communications and even turn off Gaza's mobile phone and internet networks. It has complete air superiority with Israeli jets and drones able to monitor every movement on the ground, but not below the surface."", 'One senior Israeli defence source told the BBC that they were still identifying more than 100 new targets each day, although that list is likely to diminish the longer this war goes on. The longer it lasts, the more it will have to rely on troops on the ground to identify and eliminate resistance.', 'Justin Crump, a former British Army officer who now runs Sibylline, a risk intelligence company, says Israel appears to be making reasonable progress given the density of the terrain, but ""they\'re now going to encounter the more heavily defended urban areas of the city"".', 'Israeli troops are better equipped and well-trained, but urban warfare can still prove difficult for the most advanced militaries. ', ""So far, close-quarters fighting on the ground appears to have been limited, and is certainly nothing on the scale of the urban warfare that's been taking place between Russia and Ukraine in cities like Bakhmut. Much of the videos released by the IDF show that it is instead relying on tanks and armour."", ""Neither has Israel committed all its forces. Some estimate that it may have as few as 30,000 troops inside Gaza so far. That's a relatively small proportion of Israel's total - 160,000 active military personnel plus 360,000 reservists. "", 'Justin Crump says the question is how many of its infantry is it willing to commit to clearing every building and the warren of Hamas tunnels? ', 'Israel could instead chose to target Hamas strongholds. He believes Israel will try to avoid block-by-block fighting, not least because it could lead to very heavy casualties. It would also certainly jeopardise the lives of more than 200 hostages. ', ""Which raises the question as to whether Israel's stated war aim - destroying Hamas - is really achievable. Even senior Israeli officials recognise that destroying an ideology with bombs and bullets is impossible. "", 'Some of the group\'s leadership isn\'t even in Gaza. Mr Katz says that if elements of Hamas can survive this war, then they could still claim ""because we\'re still here, we\'ve actually won"".

', ""Among the first to announce their presence were Marine Le Pen, three-time presidential candidate for the National Rally (formerly the National Front), and the party's young president, Jordan Bardella. "", 'Almost simultaneously came a rejoinder from their counterpart on the far left, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, irascible leader of France Unbowed (LFI). His party would not be attending, he tweeted, because the march was a ""rendezvous for unconditional supporters of the massacre [of Gazans]"".', 'It is hard to overestimate the symbolic significance of this switch-over.', 'For decades French politics erected a bulwark against the far right, whose views - not least on Jews - were deemed ""anti-Republican"". The old National Front under Marine\'s father Jean-Marie Le Pen was seen as beyond the pale, and it was shunned.', ""The far left meanwhile - the Communists, the Trotskyists and the new formations like Mr Mélenchon's LFI - were certainly attacked for their views, but they were never excluded. They were part of the broad political family, in a way that the Le Pen franchise clearly wasn't."", 'A few years ago, for a far-left party not to have been part of a march against antisemitism would have been unthinkable. For a far-right party to have been there instead would have been unconscionable. ', 'Such is the shake-up in the political order, which of course long predates the Gaza war and is mirrored in varying ways across other European countries.', 'Today\'s far right, rebranded ""hard right"" or ""national right"" has - in France at least - forgotten its obsession with Jews and its claims of a ""Jewish lobby"". Its primary focus now is the three I\'s - immigration, insecurity and Islamism - issues on which it finds common cause with many Jews.', 'Meanwhile the far left in France, analysing Gaza through the anti-colonial lens, sees an oppressed people hammered by a superpower proxy and shouts ""Solidarity!""  Having lost the support of the old working class, many of whom vote National Rally, it has a new natural base among politicised immigrants.', 'Thus we arrive at the novel situation where a party whose founder once called the Holocaust a ""detail of history"" openly embraces the cause of French Jews; and at the other end of the spectrum, a party built on ideas of human rights and equality stands accused of antisemitism for failing to call Hamas ""terrorist"".', 'Maybe this should all be nuanced. After all, many people still think that at heart the far right, by virtue of its French-first ethos, cannot help but be anti-Jewish.  They note that Jordan Bardella this week refused to explicitly call Jean-Marie Le Pen antisemitic - a faux-pas to which enemies of the National Rally (RN) have reacted with glee.', ""And on the far left there are signs of division around Jean-Luc Mélenchon, whose prickly personality and autocratic methods are driving some colleagues to exasperation.  This week one senior lieutenant, Raquel Garrido, was given a four-month suspension as party spokeswoman for challenging the leader's line - not least on Hamas. "", ""But the fundamental point remains: the RN under Marine Le Pen is manoeuvring itself very successfully into the mainstream, while Mr Mélenchon's LFI is manoeuvring itself out.  "", 'Opinion polls bear it out: according to IFOP last week, Marine Le Pen would trounce the opposition in the first round of a presidential election today, with up to 33% of the vote. Mr Mélenchon, at 22% in the 2022 election, is down to 14%.

So when I see a big party of the far right abandon antisemitism and negationism and move towards our Republican values, naturally I rejoice.""', '""The far left for its part has always had its own antisemitic tradition.

It tells him to assess the risks to the public - and make a plan accordingly. ', 'Since the Gaza conflict began, the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign (PSC) has organised three national protests in London on successive Saturdays that have grown larger week-on-week.', 'It has negotiated with the police over the route and duration of each and abided by conditions. ', 'The police have a delicate balancing act to perform in protecting free speech and assembly - and also protecting the rights of others not to be intimidated. ', 'The Met says where protesters have supported terrorist groups, broken racial-hatred laws, or committed other offences, they have made arrests. So far, more than 200 have been arrested - each serious in its own terms, including some allegations of support for Hamas - which is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK. ', 'But put those numbers in the wider context of public order policing in London.', 'On Monday alone, police arrested 219 Just Stop Oil demonstrators who tried to stop traffic near Parliament. The Extinction Rebellion ""sit-ins"" of more than two years ago saw officers cart away a staggering 4,118 demonstrators. ', 'Opponents of the PSC say marchers are chanting deeply antisemitic slogans and providing a cover for extremists. But while individuals can be arrested for hate crime offences, the legal test for banning an event is more complex. ', 'The Public Order Act 1986 gives Sir Mark Rowley and other police chiefs the power to apply conditions to marches where they reasonably believe there could be: ', 'The PSC has agreed to conditions under that law. Its supporters say they will gather an hour after the two-minute silence on Armistice Day and more than a mile away from the Cenotaph. Their march, ending with a rally at the US Embassy, is planned to go nowhere near the memorial. ', 'Rishi Sunak has described holding a march on Armistice Day as disrespectful and a risk to the Cenotaph or other memorials. ', ""But given the PSC has repeatedly abided by conditions imposed on its previous marches, the only conclusion the police can reach - unless they get intelligence to the contrary - is that a risk to the Cenotaph won't come from protesters on the march route. "", ""And that's why the force has concluded there is no legal justification to ask the home secretary to ban the march. "", 'That power can only be used if a police chief believes they cannot prevent ""serious public disorder"". That basically means violent crowds potentially bent on running amok. The police haven\'t seen that in previous weeks.', 'So if police commanders asked the home secretary to ban the march, the organisers could go to court - and judges would need to see evidence and intelligence proving the serious risk.', 'Do you plan to attend a protest? Get in touch.', 'The last time these powers were used was in 2011 and 2012. The then-home secretary, on the recommendation of the Met, banned the far-right English Defence League (EDL) from marching through Muslim communities. The EDL was considered to be a thuggish mob and marchers would regularly chant racist or Islamophobic slogans.', 'The Campaign Against Antisemitism says the ""River to the Sea"" chant, that will almost certainly be heard on Saturday\'s march, is deeply offensive and threatening - but the PSC event is not going through Jewish communities - and the Met says that its legal advice is that the slogan can be legitimate free speech in such circumstances.  ', 'What would happen if the march were banned? The Met believes people would still come to London and stand in the street and peacefully have their say. The police cannot stop them. The last time they tried, it was a fiasco. ', 'In March 2021, the organisers of a vigil for murdered Londoner Sarah Everard cancelled the event. They feared they would individually face enormous fines under the then Covid lockdown rules, if they were seen to encourage the gathering. ', 'But there was such confusion over whether there was still a right to protest, regardless of the risk of transmitting the virus, that people turned out anyway. They felt so strongly about the horrific murder they wanted to be heard. The Met ended up paying compensation to women who were arrested.   ', 'So the huge risk is that, even if Suella Braverman got her way, people would not only come out, but they would march independently. That would be twice as hard for police because there would be no organisers on the ground directing events and calling on people to abide by a route and curfew.', 'And then there is the risk of counter-demonstrations.', ""Former Met commander Dal Babu says Ms Braverman's attack on the forthcoming march has emboldened the extreme far right. "", 'Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, founder of the largely defunct English Defence League under the alias Tommy Robinson, is calling on followers to join him near the Cenotaph. Other less well known figures are doing the same. ', '""I\'ve never known an occasion for the home secretary to get involved in operational policing at this level,"" says Mr Babu. ""She doesn\'t understand the law. She doesn\'t understand the legislation."" ', 'So is there anything the home secretary could do to force the Met to ban the march? ', 'If Ms Braverman is satisfied that the Met is ""failing to discharge any of its functions in an effective manner"" she can direct the Mayor of London to intervene. ', 'But that is a power designed to be used in exceptional circumstances. And she is not allowed to use that power until she has first consulted the inspectorate of police forces, the expert body on how chief constables are performing.', 'Sir Tom Winsor, former HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary, told BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme that Ms Braverman had ""crossed the line"".', '""The operational independence of the police is not a debatable matter,"" he said.
