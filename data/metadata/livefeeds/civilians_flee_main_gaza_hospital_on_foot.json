Fuel crisis: Israel says it has agreed to allow two fuel lorries a day into Gaza, which the country's national security advisor says will prevent a collapse of the sewage system and risk of disease to its troops. The US government has said this agreement amounts to around 140,000 litres every two days - 120,000 of which will be used to fuel aid vehicles and other humanitarian efforts, with the remainder to power communication networks. But aid agencies warn this is nowhere near enough to run their humanitarian operations, amid growing fears of people starving as they desperately search for food.  2. Communication networks: Communication networks in Gaza were down for more than a day, after the strip's telecoms firms ran out of fuel to generate power for phone or internet networks. Signal has since been partially restored, two companies say, after a delivery of some fuel.  3. Al-Shifa search: The crisis at al-Shifa hospital is ongoing, where Israel recently began searching for evidence of a Hamas command centre it says is located in tunnels under Gaza's largest medical facility. The Israeli military says its troops have found the body of a second woman held hostage by Hamas, during a search close to al-Shifa.

Pressure on Netanyahu: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted Israeli forces have not been \"successful\" in minimizing civilian casualties in Gaza but blamed Hamas for using people as human shields. One of Netanyahu's predecessors, Ehud Olmert, has called for a political solution to resolve the future of Gaza in a BBC interview - blaming his rival for security failings that led to more than 1,200 Israelis being killed by Hamas.  5.
